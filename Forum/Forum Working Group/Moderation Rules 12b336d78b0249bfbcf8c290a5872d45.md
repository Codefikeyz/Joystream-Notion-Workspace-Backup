# Moderation Rules

This Moderation Policy covers online discussions and posting of content using the Joystream Forum. 

 The forum is the primary place for community-wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to the platform among members. It is hierarchically organized into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and beneficial interactions among members. The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic-based discussions, called *threads*, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of *posts*. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on a question. To create a thread an initial deposit is needed that goes into a thread account, all posts also requires a deposit that goes into the thread account related to the post, whenever a thread is deleted the funds from the thread account are transferred to the caller of the delete extrinsic.

 This service includes many differing opinions and experiences. You may find opinions that you disagree with. Our aim at all times is to provide a place where the maximum discussion can take place.

 We try to be as fair as we can when moderating but in a large community of users, with many different viewpoints, there will always be some people that will not be happy with our moderation policies. While we regret that this happens, we cannot suit all of the people all of the time and have to make decisions based on what is best for the forum overall.
