# Forum Plan - Term 15

# **1. Current group composition :**

- Lead name: Songoku
- Worker: N/A

# 2. Planned Budget for the Term

Lead salary was increased on Term 13 so there was accumulated debt.

To arrange this, I updated group budget to just to pay debt and necessary expenses on remaining days of this term. Next council term, the group budget would pay for one complete council term.

**Budget Request:** Debt + Remaining Lead Salary for this term +Best Forum Thread Reward

Current Block (as of writing): 3256797

Remaining Block for this term (Est): 112967

**Debt:** 652.54 Joy

**Remaining Lead Salary for this term:** 112967*0.07 = 7907.69 Joy

**Best Forum Thread Reward:** 400 Joy

**Budget Request:** 652.54 + 7907.69 + 400

**Budget Refill Request = 8960.23 Joy**

# 3. Group Priorities for the Term

- Create needed new categories/ sub categories on the forum
- Review forum threads/posts and moderate if necessary
- Archive inactive, closed or concluded threads
- Pick best forum thread for the term
- Write summary of pre-proposals with open questions for stale threads.
