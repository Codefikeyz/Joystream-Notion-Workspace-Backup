# Salary Adjustment Procedure (Draft)

This is the proposal-guideline for adjusting Council and WG Salaries in alignment to volatility of $Joystream governance coin price after listing.

1. $Joystream coin price from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/joystream/) is recorded by council secretary/HR group on a thread daily every 12:00 UTC (coinmarketcap time).
    1. If no available data for 12:00 UTC, price from a close time can be used (put note).
    2. This whole item 1 can be automated in the future.
2. When new term council creates council plan, they include previous term average price of $Joystream coin. They also include in plan recomputed salary for council and WG leads.
3. When council plan is approved, the new term council submits proposal adjusting their council salary and WG leads salary. This must be implemented within 24 hours after approval.
    1. If council doesn’t do it within 24 hours, council secretary calls out them.
    2. If $Joystream price significantly changes (whether up or down) after approval of council plan without being implemented yet, the council plan would still be followed.
4. WG leads adjusts workers salary within 24 hours after approval of council plan.
    1. If WG leads doesn’t do it within 24 hours, council calls out them and can reduce their salaries.
    2. If $Joystream price significantly changes (whether up or dump) after approval of council plan without being implemented yet, the council plan would still be followed.
