From January 11, 2024 to January 27, 2024

The load is the same as the previous term.

The last two days of new channels and non-YPP videos have increased 4 times

Content curator at Gleev Prontera checked 321 channels using the YPP program for the entire period, more than previous periods. In the last 5 days, the only curator of YPP channels is prontera.

During the term, the CRP v2 content creator award program was adopted and rejected by the council.

Kira [rechecked](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zrc_FAdTOr7o3ix4ZFOxglRJytR903VvjgiUgAe_VcM/edit#gid=0) most of old YPP channels against the new requirements for the lower threshold of subscribers on Youtube. I had previously deferred this payment due to a shrinking budget.

# **3. Group tasks**

First priority:

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/)
- NFT promotion in Discord (the curator of the day publishes interesting NFT(s) in the #nfts channel).
- It was not possible to provide a good CRP v2 video support program due to the program being cancelled.

Second priority:

- Coordinated with MWG to tweet the best NFTs and content.
- Updated the channel weights for display on the Gleyev main page.
- Created YouTube Partner Program reports.

## **4. Extra items**

- All videos are verified.
