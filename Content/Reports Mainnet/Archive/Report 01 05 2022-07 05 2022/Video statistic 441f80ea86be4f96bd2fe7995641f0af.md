[Video Statistic report](Video%20statistic/Video%20Statistic%20report%205215c05f5c6e484781f09ec7b4312401.csv)

### Conclusion:

- As we could see (from the "Video Statistics" section), 60% of the videos are spam, just like last week (90% spam) and have been deleted.

- The number of uploaded videos per day (I'm not talking about spam) is still critically low.
Can we offer additional motivation to content creators to add to the video catalog?
- How else can we affect this action except by censoring its content?
