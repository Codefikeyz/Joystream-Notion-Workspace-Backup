# WORKING GROUP PLAN

## **Goals and priorities**

- Improve scoring.
- Make the report better
- Improve overall WG performance
- Coordinate effectively with the Board

## Sсope

Current WG Composition:

WG Lead: @Kira_skipper 
WG Worker: @spat_sochi 

- Due to the even workload of this workgroup and the number of uploaded videos, there are only 2 employees in it, as adding more is not necessary yet.

### Plan for hirings:

- If there are applicants in the WG who are a good fit for the position, I will consider adding 1 more person and requesting additional funds from the board for worker's compensation. I will definitely give the newcomers a way in.

### Planned firings:

- No, unless deemed necessary: in the event of failure to perform duties, an emergency situation, or personal reasons and desires of employees.

### On-boarding plans for new comers:

- To help newcomers adjust, priorities and goals for the next term will include creating a good opening and posting it from time to time in channels that newcomers tend to see and visit.
I also regularly respond to inquiries (in DM) about work and descriptions of workgroup responsibilities and tasks.

### Suggestions to Council and JSG:

Suggested idea for a bounty:

[Bounty №1](../../../Ideas/Bounty%20%E2%84%961%205948b950a01642e1b39de960f134abb5.md)

- Discuss the budget and nature of the awards

Together with the HR team, make a plan to attract newcomers. 

- Introduce newcomers to the video platform.
- Show them how to upload videos. Introduce them to licenses (to avoid mistakes)
- Offer to create a channel. Invite them to share content.
- Determine what information is missing to entice users to create and maintain a channel.
