# **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Launch system of guides for every new curator;
    - Qulantity of new recruitsa is hugh, we need to launch internal contest for the right to be involved in.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

We think about improving of communication between Leads. Maybe, it’s good idea to establish stand-up calls four times in a week;

Close for a while openings for new recruits - the group is full there is no demand of new curators.
