# Group Priorities for the Term

1. The priority is to make the video check as fast as possible than at the moment. Namely:
to check videos immediately after 24 hours of uploading by the authors.
2. Find a solution together with the Builders on how to identify the user-owner of the video channel for feedback from the curators. (Now when we look for channel owners and want to inform them about content violations or other errors - many users are not in discord. And on the forum as well.)

# List of Suggestions

(Ranked list of suggestions for problems groups **should** attempt to tackle, and how, with corresponding budgeting, marketing or other resources needed from council or Jsgenesis)

1. Conducting a Bounty to attract authors and replenish quality original content. Discussing the budget that can be provided for a small incentive.
2. Discuss what else is missing from the Council for the CWG report to be readable. What data is missing?
3. Increase the effectiveness of the group by constantly interacting with interested Board members. Increase the activity of the group.
4. The curatorial team works with content processing and moderation on a week-by-week basis. Would you be comfortable if we reported every Monday? For example, before noon. So there wouldn't be any confusion. I'm sure there won't be any more problems with late reporting.
