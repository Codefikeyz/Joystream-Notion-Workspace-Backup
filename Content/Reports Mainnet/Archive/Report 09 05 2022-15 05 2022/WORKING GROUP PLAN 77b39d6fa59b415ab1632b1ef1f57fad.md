# WORKING GROUP PLAN

## **Goals and priorities**

- Improve scoring
- Improve overall WG performance
- Coordinate effectively with the Board

## Sсope

Current WG Composition:

WG Lead: @Kira_skipper 
WG Worker 1.: @spat_sochi 
WG Worker 2.: @prontera

### Plan for hirings:

- A new member of the working group has been hired:
@prontera

### Planned firings:

- No, unless deemed necessary: in the event of failure to perform duties, an emergency situation, or personal reasons and desires of employees.

### On-boarding plans for new comers:

- I give the new employee time to adapt. But due to the fact that he quickly got into the general course of work, I immediately set a salary.
In addition, the group became a little more unloaded, and therefore can already think as a larger team and come up with new ideas and suggestions.

### Suggestions to Council and JSG:

Suggested idea for a bounty:

[Bounty №1](../../../Ideas/Bounty%20%E2%84%961%205948b950a01642e1b39de960f134abb5.md)

- Discuss the budget and nature of the awards!!!

Together with the HR team, make a plan to attract newcomers. 

- The priority is to promote original video content.
Copying is not a relevant and correct way to add to video repository.
- Introduce newcomers to the video platform.
- Show them how to upload videos. Introduce them to licenses (to avoid mistakes)
- Offer to create a channel. Invite them to share content.
- Determine what information is missing to entice users to create and maintain a channel.
