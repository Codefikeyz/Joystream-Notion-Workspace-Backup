# 7. **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

1. **Short idea**: giving opportunity to manage community bounty of CWG
2. **Detailed description**. We launched process of endless learning of newcomers (7-days trial period than new guys will come). It would be awesome if newcomers will manage our bounties for a day or two within the trial period. It gives them new expirience and basic skill of managing. Also, we can catch useful improvements and ideas. 
3. **Plan**. Just to give an opportunity for newcomers execute processes of managing bounty for a 1 day within their trial period. 
4. **Funding** does not required. 
5. **Council assistance** does not required
