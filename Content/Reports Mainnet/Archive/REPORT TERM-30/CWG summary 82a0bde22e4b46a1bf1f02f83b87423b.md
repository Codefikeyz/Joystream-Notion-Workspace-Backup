# 8. **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- We think about improving of communication between Leads. Maybe, it’s good idea to establish stand-up calls four times in a month. Every member of CWG is needed as participant and every member of community is welcome;
- We need to establish plan for migration into mainnet. Roles, payments and strategy. First stage - making draft and show it to the Council.
