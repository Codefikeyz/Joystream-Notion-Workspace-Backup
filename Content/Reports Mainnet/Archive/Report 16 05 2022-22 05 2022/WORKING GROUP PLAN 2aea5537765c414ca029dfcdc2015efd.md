## Sсope

Current WG Composition:

WG Lead: @Kira_skipper 
WG Worker 1.: @spat_sochi 
WG Worker 2.: @prontera

### Plan for hirings:

- None

### Planned firings:

- No, unless deemed necessary: in the event of failure to perform duties, an emergency situation, or personal reasons and desires of employees.

### On-boarding plans for new comers:

- I give the new employee time to adapt. But due to the fact that he quickly got into the general course of work, I immediately set a salary.
In addition, the group became a little more unloaded, and therefore can already think as a larger team and come up with new ideas and suggestions.

### Suggestions to Council and JSG:

Suggested idea for a bounty:

- Discuss the budget and nature of the awards.

Together with the HR team, make a plan to attract newcomers. 

- The priority is to promote original video content.
Copying is not a relevant and correct way to add to video repository.
- Introduce newcomers to the video platform.
- Show them how to upload videos. Introduce them to licenses (to avoid mistakes)
- Offer to create a channel. Invite them to share content.
- Determine what information is missing to entice users to create and maintain a channel.
