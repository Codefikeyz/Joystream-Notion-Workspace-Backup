Content curator on Gleev Prontera checked 2,848 channels under the YPP program for the entire period, 25% of which were rejected due to gross violations (bots, increased views, duplication of channels, etc.).
Once again the record for the number of channels and downloaded videos has been broken. The number of channels has increased by about one and a half times. A separate difficulty was that Google Sheets tables have limitations (as it turned out).

## **3. Group tasks**

First priority:

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/) and [l1.media](https://l1.media/)
- All non yt-synch channels are reviewed for Reward Content Policy by curators in more than 48 hours after first video is published [[objectives score OKR](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMaVGcaY=/)].

Second priority:

- An offer has been created with a reward (44500 Joy in total) to the authors of the CRP and NFT Scheme programs through the Update Channel Payouts offer. But the consuls did not have time to hide this proposal. This will be recreated.
- NFT promotion in Discord (the curator of the day publishes interesting NFT(s) in the #nfts channel).
- Coordinate with MWG to tweet the best NFTs and content.
- Curators evaluated new NFTs. There are some notable NFTs found. Next semester I will be reviewing all NFTs to reward the best ones available.

## **4. Extra items**

- All videos are verified. 2 toxic video NFTs have been hidden.
