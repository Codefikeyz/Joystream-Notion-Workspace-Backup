============

Content Curator On Gleev Prontera checked 2023 channels using the YPP program for the entire term, 60% of which were rejected due to gross violations (bots, boosted views, duplicate channels, etc.)
In general, this Term was the most cumbersome in the entire history of Joystream, the number of new channels and videos breaks all records. In one week from 19th to 25th October, 40% of all channels were added.

## **3. Group tasks**

First priority:

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/) and [l1.media](https://l1.media/)
- All non yt-synch channels are reviewed for Reward Content Policy by curators in more than 48 hours after first video is published [[objectives score OKR](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMaVGcaY=/)].

Second priority:

- An offer has been created with a reward (17,800 Joy in total) to authors under the CRP and NFT Scheme programs through the Update Channel Payouts proposal.
- NFT promotion in Discord (the curator of the day publishes interesting NFT(s) in the #nfts channel).
- Coordinate with MWG to tweet the best NFTs and content.
- Curators evaluated new NFTs. There are some notable NFTs found. Next semester I will be reviewing all NFTs to reward the best ones available.

## **4. Extra items**

- All videos are verified. 97 duplicates were removed.
- In a call with consuls at Term 21, it was determined that the ideal formula for paying salaries to curators could not yet be found, so a policy was adopted of adding a job description and disclosing some significant details.
