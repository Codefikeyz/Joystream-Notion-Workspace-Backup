# **3. Group tasks**

First priority:

- NFT promotion on Discord has been suspended.

Second priority:

- The effort was coordinated with MWG to tweet the best NFTs and content. A record in referrals has been recorded. In one term, about 400 channels came from the link from channel 47429.
- The update of the scales channel for display on the Gleev Home page occurred twice.
- Generated reports on the YouTube Partner Program.
- There was no discussion about the possibility of extending CRP v2 and the NFT creation incentive program due to the ongoing trend of budget cuts.
- Stopped processing unloaded videos.
- A proposal to reduce costs through efficiency and automation has been made.
- A reward system based on productivity and time spent, with a known hourly rate per term, was created after discussion with the consuls.
