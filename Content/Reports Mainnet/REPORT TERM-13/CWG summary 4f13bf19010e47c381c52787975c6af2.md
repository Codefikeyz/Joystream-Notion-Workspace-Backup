Second priority:

## **4. Extra items**

- All videos are verified. No prohibited content.
- As a result of discussions with the consuls, it was decided to remove the mandatory review of videos uploaded through YPP due to pre-moderation built into YouTube. Emphasis was placed on the viewing speed of videos downloaded directly.
