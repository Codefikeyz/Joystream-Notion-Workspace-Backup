From December 27, 2023 to January 10, 2024

The workload is decreasing again.

For some time (4 days), the curators worked again in the old table due to the fact that the curator's tools did not work. When the functionality of the curator’s tools was restored, the curators duplicated the information about the inspection into it.

Content curator on Gleev Prontera checked 374 channels under the YPP program for the entire period, more then previous terms. Content curator on Gleev Kira checked 349 channels under the YPP program.
