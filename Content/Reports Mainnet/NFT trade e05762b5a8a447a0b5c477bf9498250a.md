# Brief summary

[NFT Reward Program](../NFT/NFT%20Reward%20Scheme%20142bbc76f54b4a52908fee2b9923c76c.md) is valid from the 18th term. After the 20th deadline, there is a slight increase in the value of recent auction amounts and the number of completed NFT auctions. The value of successful sales will be even **lower**.
Ybp[jlzobq trend shows that the trend is not sufficient to meet this OKR for the 4th quarter. **There is a very high probability that the goal will not be achieved.**
It is also highly doubtful that the [NFT Scheme](../NFT/NFT%20Reward%20Scheme%20142bbc76f54b4a52908fee2b9923c76c.md) program works, since the different values seem to be random. **I propose to discontinue the rewards program.**
