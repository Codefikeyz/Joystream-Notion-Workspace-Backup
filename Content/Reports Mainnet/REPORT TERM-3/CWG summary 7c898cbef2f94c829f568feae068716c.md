### Add:
Illegal content

- Videos promoting illegal drugs or drug use will be blocked.
Videos containing hate speech or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other protected ground.
- Videos that violate copyright laws or violate intellectual property rights
- Videos containing any other content that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive will be blocked at the curator's discretion.

We are in close contact with the gateway operators and make decisions together.

### Delete:

What measures are taken against violators

If you post content that does not comply with our policies, we will remove it and let you know. The first violation will only result in a notice, but next time we may issue you a warning. If you receive a third (EXAMPLE) warning, your channel will be deleted.
We can block your channel or account if there are multiple violations or one serious violation of our requirements. This measure also applies if the channel was created specifically to perform actions that are contrary to our rules.

### Changing rules:

Joystream employees review these reports and take action as needed:

- Flag videos that violate community guidelines as inappropriate;
- Report to gateway operators so that they can block content.

# 6. **List of completed tasks**

- Initiation of the work of curators
- Discussion about changing curation rules
- Creation of a thread for complaints from content authors [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/84](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/84)
- Checking all videos for January
- Reasoning about the need to create tools for the curator [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/95](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/95)

# 7. **Ideas to improve Working Group and pre-plan**

1. Due to the limited impact of the *isCensored* label on the output of gateway content and the planned (discussed) change in the capabilities of consuls in the next term, it is necessary to determine a clear picture of the jurisdiction of the curators (or at least continue to discuss this).
2. Due to the fact that @Kira_skipper checked all the videos in January (she started long before the formation of the Curator Group), I plan to raise her salary. We are solving a number of organizational processes with @ferdikesh_studio, I will increase his area of responsibility and also increase his salary.
