Branding Rewards Feedback: I think uploading first on Gleev should be rewarded a little more, but sticking with creators who combine both strategies in their videos gives greater visibility since adding preroll content on YouTube will give Gleev greater visibility.

Feedback: At first I saw different rewards: preroll videos on YouTube up to $120 and exclusive videos on Gleev up to $600. I would like to know if you can still access those benefits or not, thank you very much.
Option to Try: Combine both approaches get x10 rewards for such videos
Type of branding: Any combination which maximises my rewards, Post-roll, Pre-roll
