# Feedback on Gleev Mobile App pt I

Status: Done

tested on iOs

Issue Raised: 

**General**

[https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6284](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6284)

1. Feedback widget needs to be repositioned to the bottom on mobile
2. Was unable to switch networks (I think we need this to test all flows)

**Signing Up**

1. Creating membership stalled for me on opening the text file by default (with full page white screen showing text and no controls to hide/ progress smh)
2. Clicking on areas outside of modals should close the modal. Rn cannot close sign in modal

**Profile Mgt**

1. Uploading avatar didn’t work
2. Submitting changes on Profile mgt page is hard since buttons are hidden below the menu (see bottom of the screen)

3. Toaster error notifications stay on the screen. Need to disappear after 4 seconds
4. Export Seed → once exported white screen which cannot be closed (same as with saving seed to txt file during signup)
5. Drop down of profile mgt options does not close when Porftolio page loads. Closes only on second tap on profile icon.

**Channel Mgt**
1. CRT landing page shows “unsupported browser modal”

1. Learn more opens Notion using in-app browser (?) and I didn’t find a way to navigate back to the Gleev app. 

**Notifications**
1. Overflow menu on individual notifications level opens behind the component so invisible

**Creator Tokens**

1. Holders widget alignment issues (see how name of member goes over the Total. Think we need horisontal scrolling here
