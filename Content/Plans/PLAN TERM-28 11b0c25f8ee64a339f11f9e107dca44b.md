| 0 | igrex | WG Lead |

### **Planned WG budget:**

Due to the ongoing trend towards reducing DAO expenses and at the request of the counsil, the curator group is again reducing expenses. The Curator Group has experienced and highly motivated members; the dismissal of any employee may result in the loss of an employee, so a temporary decision has been made to reduce the budget. The total budget is 25% lower than in the last term.
