Due to the high workload of the Gleev curator, reinforcement was required and @Prontera  was quickly hired for a much larger volume of work. Due to the agreed budget, a significant increase in salary was increased only in the new Term.

**Planned spending after salary:** 

3 Category A videos were identified under the [CRP](../Content%20Rewards%20Policy%20f215e3fb7b984827a6facf2de683e40a.md). Authors will be awarded (**3000 Joy**) after verification.
