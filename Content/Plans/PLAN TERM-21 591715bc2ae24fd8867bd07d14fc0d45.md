### **Planned WG budget:**

The discussion continues about the system of payments to employees of the group of curators. Therefore, the current system remains until the new payment system is approved.

**Planned spending:** **132 540 JOY/term** (**41,040** for Lead, **21,700 Joy** for Omer(Ferdikesh_studio) **10,930 Joy** each for kira_skipper, firuz89, mikasa, tes_hsn, **25,920 Joy** for Curator Gleev prontera). 

**Planned spending after salary:** 

127 videos of “category A” under the [CRP](../Content%20Rewards%20Policy%20f215e3fb7b984827a6facf2de683e40a.md) from 17 authors were marked. Due to the fact that there is a limit on awards of 10k Joy, all videos will be reviewed and candidates for the award will be selected.

After reviewing all historical NFTs and revaluing them, the best ones will be selected for [NFT Sheme](../NFT/NFT%20Reward%20Scheme%20142bbc76f54b4a52908fee2b9923c76c.md) rewards.

### **CWG priorities for part of term:**

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/) and [l1.media](https://l1.media/)
- All non yt-synch channels are reviewed for Reward Content Policy by curators in more than 48 hours after first video is published [objectives score [OKR](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMaVGcaY=/)]
- Working with CRP [[Content Rewards Policy](../Content%20Rewards%20Policy%20f215e3fb7b984827a6facf2de683e40a.md)]

Additionally: 

- Promoting NFTs in Discord (curator of the day posts interesting NFT(s) in #nfts channel)
- Coordinate with MWG for Twitter posting of the best NFTs and content
- Hire a Gleev curator to review new YPP channels.
