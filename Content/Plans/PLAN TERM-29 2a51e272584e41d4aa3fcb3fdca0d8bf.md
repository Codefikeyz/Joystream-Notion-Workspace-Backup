### **Planned WG budget:**

During the last term, compensation plans were [proposed](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/835?post=6129) and a payment method was chosen for the workers of the Curator Group, taking into account the time spent and additional time.

**JOY/USDT EMA30: [0.026](https://joystream.stg.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1000&type=block&from=JOY&to=USD&time=6148828)** USDT ([Message in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1167788646204723200/1206293299531485325))

For main work, payment is calculated using the formula:

```
MainWorkUSDT = (RoundUp (NumberOfVerifiedVideos / 100)) * CostPerHundredVideos
```

In this case, the

**CostPerHundredVideo = 50 USDT**

For additional work, payment will be made according to the formula:

```
AdditionalWorkUSDT = HoursSpent * CostOfAnHour
```

In this case, the

**CostOfAnHour = 5 USDT**

|  | Extra Hours | USDT for addition work | Videos (Term28, 29) | USDT for main work | Total USDT | Total Joy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| igrex |  |  |  | 1067 | 1067 | 41040 |
| tes_hsn |  | 0 | 265 | 150 | 150 | 5769 |
| firuz89 |  | 0 | 332 | 200 | 200 | 7692 |
| kira_skipper | 7 | 35 | 209 | 150 | 185 | 7115 |
| mikasa |  | 0 | 379 | 200 | 200 | 7692 |
| Omer_OzdemirTR | 20 | 100 | 299 | 150 | 250 | 9615 |
| prontera | 105 | 525 | 193 | 100 | 625 | 24038 |
|  |  |  |  |  | 2677 | 102961 |

**Update (20.02.2024)** Due to the agreement of the CWG streamlining and staff redundancies, the plan was revised. Since payment is made throughout the entire term for the entire previous term, it is necessary to calculate the payment to employees for the entire Term 28 and partially for Term 29 (before changing the video verification). The plan has added accounting for the work of employees for Term29 (from February 12 to February 19). The remainder of the funds will be paid to curators through direct payments from the group budget upon dismissal. Will be fired: tes_hsn, firuz89, kira_skipper, mikasa, Omer_OzdemirTR.

### **CWG priorities for part of term:**

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/) via Curator tools

Additionally: 

- Coordinate with MWG for Twitter posting of the best NFTs and content
- Update weights channel for show in Main page Gleev.
- Make YPP Reports
- Continue work on optimizing and automating some YPP channel verification processes
