### **Planned WG budget:**

**Planned spending:** **130,174 JOY/term** (**41,040** for Lead, @ferdikesh_studio, @Kira_skipper, @Prontera and @abramaria_: **10,930 Joy/term** each, @Counsellor **6,480 JOY/term**, new workers [Import Jan 28, 2023](https://www.notion.so/87a705e6f5b54b14ace8c203dbb5529a?pvs=21) and [Import Jan 28, 2023](https://www.notion.so/e8a06c76e40e44d19390f42227fc4fe4?pvs=21) : **7,776  JOY/term each**).  

**Planned spending after salary:** 

Some videos were identified for [CRP](../Content%20Rewards%20Policy%20f215e3fb7b984827a6facf2de683e40a.md) payments, after checks, 11 videos remained for payment. **+11,000 Joy**

There are 18 early adopters left under the CRP program. But they will be paid through the Proposal Update Channel Payment from the general budget.

Direct payments for extra work (for @ferdikesh_studio, @Kira_skipper, [Import Jan 28, 2023](https://www.notion.so/e8a06c76e40e44d19390f42227fc4fe4?pvs=21), [Import Jan 28, 2023](https://www.notion.so/87a705e6f5b54b14ace8c203dbb5529a?pvs=21)  : **8,000 Joy.**

For one day of downtime without a salary due to an empty budget, I plan to pay curators a total of **4384 Joy.**

### **CWG priorities for part of term:**

- The main work of curating videos, channels and metadata (resources) in [Gleev](https://gleev.xyz/) and [l1.media](https://l1.media/)
- All non yt-synch channels are reviewed for Reward Content Policy by curators in more than 48 hours after first video is published [objectives score [OKR](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMaVGcaY=/)]
- Working with CRP [[Content Rewards Policy](../Content%20Rewards%20Policy%20f215e3fb7b984827a6facf2de683e40a.md)]

Additionally: 

- I plan to pay rewards on CRP, for [non-YPP channels](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/434)
- Continue assistance in the development of curatorial work for new employees
