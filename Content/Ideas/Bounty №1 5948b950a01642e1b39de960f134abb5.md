**Reason for creation:**

A weekly check and a closer look at the videos from each category revealed the following:

- There is no influx of content.
- In the existing, still observed copying other people's videos from other platforms, and even with the wrong categories.
- Creativity and quality of video works is absent.
- There are a lot of materials up to 1 minute long without any sense.

**Task:**

- To increase the number of original videos
- To provide "fillability" for particular video categories
- To fill the content catalog with high-resolution video
- To provoke interest from users to participate and watch
- Allow the talents that participate in the project to unfold.
(Reward the top 5 videos and give others a guaranteed symbolic award for participation).
In this vein, the option of creating such a bounty was born:
