# How many founding members will there be?

There is no explicit target, but one can attempt to work out what a sensible minimum number of highly committed and competent people are required to operate the DAO on mainnet launch usia simple toy model, as follows:

| **Role** | **Estimated** |
| --- | --- |
| Council Member | 8 |
| Marketing Lead | 1 |
| Marketer | 8 |
| Human Resources Lead | 1 |
| Human Resources Representativ3 | 6 |
| Builders Lead | 1 |
| Builder | 5 |
| Storage Providers Lead | 1 |
| Storage Providers | 20 |
| Distributor Lead | 1 |
| Distributors | 30 |
| Content Curator Lead | 1 |
| Content Curator | 4 |
| Membership Lead | 1 |
| Membership Evangelist | 4 |
| Forum Moderator Lead | 1 |
| Forum Moderator | 3 |
| Gateway Lead | 1 |
| **TOTAL** | **96** |

Assuming each actor would only occupy a single role, which may not be true - certainly in the infrastructure working groups (storage & distribution), and further assuming we would want to have some redundancy - say `3x` , in founding members to the absolute needed number of actors, as not everyone, this yields an estimate of the number of founding members to be

**`288`**

However, this is just an estimate to give some insight into our thinking, we could do well with more or less than this.

# How long will this program last?

Our goal is to keep it going as long as possible until mainnet launch, possible even going beyond mainnet. The only reason to stop it before this time would be to make substantial changes due to some identified problem, or because we have severely exceeded what seems like a feasible total number for the purposes of the program.

# Can I sell my membership?

No, this is strictly against the rules. If it was ever discovered that a membership has been sold at any point, before or after becoming a Founding Member, then this membership would be disabled and kicked out from the program. We will do a final verification before genesis launch where we confirm initial verifications done.

# How much $JOY makes me a Founding Member?

There is no direct relationship between $JOY earned and FM status, howeve the more the better in terms of your prospects. If you are unsure about why you have not yet earned the status, despite a high $JOY allocation, please write `why_not_fm@jsgenesis.com`.

# Can I get kicked out?

Very much so, yes, please read the full ruleset below. Jsgenesis reserved the right to evict anyone from the founding member program, or to deduct or remove their $JOY allocation, including permanently banning them from future participation. Actions such as attempting to attack the integrity of the program, for example by subverting the verification, or by attempting to sell shares of $JOY allocations, will lead to the most severe and immediate sanctions.
