# Content Creator onboarding experience report (kate_fm#0169)

1. joystream.org

I am a Content Creator. I entered the page [https://www.joystream.org/start-here/what-is-joystream](https://www.joystream.org/start-here/what-is-joystream)

There was a pop-up "This site uses cookies..." on the bottom of the page. I clicked "Find out more" link, it led to the page [https://www.joystream.org/privacy-policy](https://www.joystream.org/privacy-policy)

On this page I found 2 broken links (reported in Discord #bug-reports)

I read through the page and clicked "Accept" button
Then examined the page [https://www.joystream.org/start-here/what-is-joystream/](https://www.joystream.org/start-here/what-is-joystream/)
Watched the first video. The experience was rather bad, because the video stopped a lot of times and I had to wait until it resumed to play.
I clicked "Next video" button and that's where a pop-up for choosing the role appeared.
Clicked "Video creator", the role appeared in the upper right corner near "Next Video" button
The second video also paused a lot of times, was unable to watch. But the text below was useful, allowed me to understand what is Founding Members program and ways of contribution
Clicked "Next Video". The 3rd video is very interesting to me - it is "How to make a living as a video creator". Didn't even try to watch the video, just read the text.
Would like to have the link to Atlas here:

Went through the page, liked these ancient style images.
Found the text "Ready to contribute as a Video Creator?", clicked "Get Started" button.
It opened a new page [https://www.joystream.org/contribute/video-creator/](https://www.joystream.org/contribute/video-creator/)
Went through the page, decided to chat directly on the page.

1. Discord

Created a new Discord account by entering email (no phone number was required)
Clicked "Login" button. Could not write anything because "You do not have permisson to send messages"

Decided to go directly to Discord, clicked "Open Discord" button
Was immediately greeted by Jen=)
Could not go further because I need a phone for verification to be able to write.
On this step, such categories are visible to me: "Important", "General", "Testnet roles", "Governance" "Miscellaneous"

1. Creating a membership

While creating a membership, I found the toggle button "I was referred by a member" a bit confusing. It is set to "No", but it looks active as if "Yes". If I switch to "Yes", it is also like active.

We need 2 colours here: light blue and blue.

This is how standard toggle buttons look like [https://dribbble.com/shots/10070945-Toggles](https://dribbble.com/shots/10070945-Toggles)

I am confused with accounts (not very used to blockchain, as I'm a Youtube video creator).
Don't know what is root and controller accounts. So I reffered to the tooltip, but the text is not useful ("Something about your root accounts", "Something about controller accounts")

Before creating a membership, need to agree to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On both pages ([https://dao.joystream.org/#/privacy,](https://dao.joystream.org/#/privacy) [https://dao.joystream.org/#/tos](https://dao.joystream.org/#/tos)) link to Pioneer is wrong ("Hosted by Us" leads to old Pioneer).
On the page [https://dao.joystream.org/#/tos](https://dao.joystream.org/#/tos) also the link to Privacy Policy is wrong (leads to joystream.org). 

One more note: this is confusing
