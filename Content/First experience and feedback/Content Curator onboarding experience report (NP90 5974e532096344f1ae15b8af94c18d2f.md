# Content Curator onboarding experience report (NP900#1047)

**As I understand it, lessons are not available for all directions right now.*

***A short note about the interface, not concerning my direction.*

*Maybe I’m having some sort of scaling glitch, but when I opened it, I saw about 80% of the future video. I feel like that might not be convenient. [Link](https://www.joystream.org/start-here/what-is-joystream)*

1. **Onboarding**

On the start page, the list looks too small (font size as plain text, no accents), but it’s not critical.

There is another nuance. When I went to the page the first time, I wanted to click on them because of the dots, the distinctive layout and the alignment on the left side with the table of contents.

For a new user, it can become like a menu.

You could try highlighting them differently. Criticizing ? — Suggestion.

My sketch :) Only flat, semetric and the frame at the bottom a little thicker.
Second slide, if I may say so. (It’s a very cool animation and an afterthought. I’d like to shake hands with whoever did it!). But it sends me into a discourtesy of skipping the bounty and workgroup information. If I’m being invited into the community so nicely, why would I want to spin the wheel up ?
Otherwise available, simple and straightforward.

2. **Entering discord**

I’m not sure if okay, but a new account must be used, just delete it later

2.1 A brand-new account requires confirmation of the cell phone number, but all channels are visible. I do not have the opportunity to check further on this account.

2.2 I asked one member to leave the group and invited him again, then there was no check. If anyone is interested in my opinion. It looks rather insecure.

But the full cycle, I could not go because of the lack of numbers.

3. **Creating membership**

It seems to me that not everyone can understand this point.
