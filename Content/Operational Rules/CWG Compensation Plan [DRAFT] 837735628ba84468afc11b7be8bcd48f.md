# CWG Compensation Plan [DRAFT]

## Prerequisites

During the entire life of the mainnet, Content Working Group's employee compensation system was never discussed. In turn, the payment system did not take into account exchange rate fluctuations and did not have a convenient descriptive basis.

## Calculation.

The work of a base worker with the responsibility of checking videos for compliance with the [rules](Content%20moderation%204bf3a2f01e6049d283e7973a6586a1e1.md) must take into account the time spent processing all assigned videos, the total duration of all videos, and the absence of a reprimand for work performed incorrectly or not completed on time.
Time spent (h) = time_spent
Cost of one hour of work = cost_of_one_hour
Total duration of all videos (days) = total_duration
Cost of one day of all videos = Cost_of_one_day
Non-Reprimand Rate = trustworthiness [1, 0.5]
Salary in term (USD)= (time_spent * cost_of_one_hour + total_duration * Cost_of_one_day ) * trustworthiness 

For a **basic curator**, without additional obligations, accept:
cost_of_one_hour = 18
Cost_of_one_day = 21
An example of calculation using the median values of the duration of all videos for Term 19:
(12 (hours) * 18 + 7 (days) * 21) * 1 = 363 (USD)

For a **curator of the YPP Gleev program from JS Genesis** with high responsibility and workload, accept, which also checks the functions of the basic curator:
cost_of_one_hour = 18
Cost_of_one_day = 21
An example of calculating the time costs and duration of all prontera videos for Term 19:
(40 (hours) * 18 + 12 (days) * 21) * 1 = 972 (USD)

For the **Deputy Lead**, who performs additional checks of authors from Youtube, searching for their contacts, accept:
cost_of_one_hour = 20
Cost_of_one_day = 21
An example of calculating the time costs and duration of all Omer videos for Term 19:
(23 (hours) * 20 + 14(days) * 21) * 1 = 754 (USD)
