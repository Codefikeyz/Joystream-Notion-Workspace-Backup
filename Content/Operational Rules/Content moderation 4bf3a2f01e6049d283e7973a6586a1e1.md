*We call for an agreement that media platforms are accountable to the people they affect, so our top priority is the safety of Joystream viewers, creators and partners. We strive to convey a spirit of thirst for experimentation, inspiration, and a desire to create something ethical and dynamic. This is only possible if everyone involved supports our initiative. That's why it's important that every Joystream user knows the rules of the community and understands why it's so important to follow them.*
