# Content Rewards Policy

To incentivize content creation in the Joystream network (all gateways), a reward system for quality content will be implemented, with the following options::

- The WG maintenance budget is no more than 10000 Joy per term (~600 USD),
- Payment schedule - once per term,
- The content evaluation system introduced the concept of criteria by which channels claim to receive remuneration::
    - Category "a":
        - Useful videos that contain new useful information that complements the general understanding of the topic;
        - Extraordinary videos that offer an unusual or innovative approach to a topic;
        - High quality video, with professional editing, high quality image and sound. It is determined by the following parameters: resolution, fps, professional shooting (lighting, good sound, script, editing, etc.).
        
        The video is longer than 1 minute. At the same time, an avatar, a background image and a clear description must be filled in on the channel. There should be one idea (style) per channel.
        
    - Category "b":
        - Interesting videos that grab the viewer's attention and make them want to add a comment or share with others;
        - Good videos that are of high quality but are not extraordinary or outstanding.
    - Category "c":
        - Regular videos that meet general quality standards but offer nothing out of the ordinary or exciting.
- The amount payable should be dependent on the category of content, and should be determined according to the following scheme:
    - For each A-grade video, 1000 Joy (no more than 5 creator channels per term).

To ensure the legitimacy of payments, the following information must be collected:

- Content licenses: You need to make sure that the channel owner has all the necessary rights and permissions to use and publish content.
- No duplication: It is necessary to check that the content is not a duplicate of already existing content on the platform.
- Legality of the content: You need to check that the content does not violate the laws and regulations in force in this jurisdiction.
- This data can be collected by Lead Curator, who will check it and confirm its validity before starting payments. This will help avoid illegal or impermissible payments and improve the protection of the interests of all participants in the payments.

For cataloging and initial statistics curators will also collect data on reactions to videos and the number of comments.

No action is required from the creator, except for filling the channel, the funds will be credited manually to the Controller Account.
