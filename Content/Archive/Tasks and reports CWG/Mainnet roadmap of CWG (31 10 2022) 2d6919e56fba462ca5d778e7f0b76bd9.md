# Mainnet roadmap of CWG (31.10.2022)

Just after launching CWG sees roadmap like this:

1. Council will make a proposal for hiring a Lead;
2. Lead starts hiring core crew (Deputy Lead and two core curators)
- Preparing full detailed opening;
- Choosing the best ones;
- Hiring WG members.
1. Start of moderating (as always - high quality and detailed)
- Lead gives access for censoring and new google sheet (as a base for report).
1. Side quests negotiation. CWG need to prepare at least 3 bounties for early users. We need to rise up content stream. 
- Pick up the best 3 ideas and making proposals for start;
- Create opening for new role - Bounty manager/curator who will be in charge of launching and moderating it, show the results via separated sheet;
- Internal discussion of rewards system and proposal for the Council as a result.
1. Lead reserve the right of launching more openings if it needs in moment CWG group members will not be constant. It depends on amount of work and volume of content. 

# Review Scores

- Response_time_i  must be excluded. This criteria can’t be notice by any visual tool (no changes in database, so no option to make select and check the changes);
- I’d like to add additional score. Let’s call it Moderation_Fullfilled_score. Comparing of two parameters. Quantity of moderated videos in CWG spreadsheet and quantity of uploaded videos within the term. Numbers must be equal.

# CWG roles

As it discovered in testnet - it’s enough with three main roles:

### **Lead role**

Link to list of responsibilities will be added soon;

Staking amount of $JOY equals 3000 USD.

### Deputy Lead role

Link to list of responsibilities will be added soon

Deputy must be hired only if CWG already had 3+ workers;

Staking amount of $JOY equals 2000 USD.

### Content curator role

Link to list of responsibilities will be added soon;

Staking amount of $JOY equals 1000 USD.

First time after launching the next config of CWG will be appropriate:
Lead
Content curator 1;

Content curator 2. 

Curators will be hired by opening, surely it will be a list of experienced ones from testnet. Then CWG will be fullfilled with next ones. 

**If there will be less seats in the WG compared to the number of seats in the current testnet, which people will you hire? Propose your criteria.**

I’d like to choose candidates who has already been curators for, at least, 5 terms. 

If it will be no one such an experinced guys, i would hire successfully graduated 7-days trial program graduators. 

**How would you manage people who didn’t find their place in your WG, but who are still quite experienced?**

They will be always in short list. When CWG will grow wider or someone from core curators will be resign, that means turn for list waiters is up. 

**Propose a forecast of capacity utilization for your WG over time (in terms of capacity required over time/ staff number required over time/ overall budget required over time).**

As i see it now.

Start config (Lead plus 2 curators):

In terms of current tJOY:
Lead rewards 10/block;

Curator rewards 5/block.

Capacity utilization/week:

Lead  - 4 hours/week

Curator - 2-3 hours/week.
