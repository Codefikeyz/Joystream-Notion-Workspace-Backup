| KR1.1: Deliver Argo Ethereum bridge. | Builders | 0.8 | The majority of development is complete, including technical design, smart contracts, and indexers, with thorough testing.

# **Distributors WG**

### **O1: Provide quality values for bandwidth and latency (TTFB) accross geographical regions for which we are having sufficient traffic, keeping the cost of operation minimal.**

| **Description** | **Responsible Party** | **Current Score** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KR1.1: [if the SpeedTest comparison is successful for t = 30 days time window then the OKR is reached at 100% (meaning: good values for Latency and Bandwidth for June 2024)](https://www.notion.so/OKRs-Q2-2024-2e583262bea940009bb26799a55c832c?pvs=21) | Distributors | 0.2 | The main reason we haven't achieved this OKR is the lack of an enterprise-level CDN, which isn't a current priority. Also, to improve, we should focus on specific locations and possibly add more operators globally. Targeting the top 10 countries by traffic in the last 30 days and adding one node in each is our best approach. |
