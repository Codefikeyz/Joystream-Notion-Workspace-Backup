**Activities** 

- Outreach and partner with big Youtubers
- Better referral system: multiple level referral system,
- Create paid marketing campaigns (strategies) like google ads.
    - it can cost 200-300 USD for the initial setup

### 21 Feb 2024

**Todo**

- Do we have any projections how much resources needed to achieve the stated target?
- Current stats:
    - How many KOLs we reached, etc
    - Next time we need info, how many channels we have
    

## 8 March

- 23.3K channels
- 1.1M videos
- We are reaching out to more creators and onboarding more new channels
- Target was quite high, probably we won’t reach the target for channels but likely very near to the video count reached (as per leet_joy, marketing WG lead)
- Some value in targeting non-crypto channels (as per dmitry)
