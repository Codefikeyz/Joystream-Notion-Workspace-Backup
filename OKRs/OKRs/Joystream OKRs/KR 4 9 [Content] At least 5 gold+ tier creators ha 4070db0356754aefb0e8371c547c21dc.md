### 21 Feb 2024

- Positive scenario - creator tokens will be available on the **March 13th**

TODO

- Give task to Robert: official tutorial how to get started with creator tokens

### 7 March 2024

- With the incoming creator token feature, CWGL is working towards onboarding Robert for making a video guide on the creators token feature.

### 8 March 2024

- per Dmitry, there are some AMM issues being ironed out which is slightly delaying the video by Robert
- per leet_joy, the UX/UI flow is unclear for CRT creation and there are some risks about creating “Bad” CRT initial parameters, maybe needs to be addressed also before instructional video + outreach to key creators starts
- per dmitry, runtime release will happen but actual Atlas/Gleev rollout may occur later on

### 15 April 2024

- From the finding from the last update, eventually the [CRT pallet has to be frozen](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/854) - this passed on April resulting for this KR to be postponed
- Recommended to be carrie over for the next quarter, to be aligned with the appropriate objective
- Status was changed to `Postponed`
