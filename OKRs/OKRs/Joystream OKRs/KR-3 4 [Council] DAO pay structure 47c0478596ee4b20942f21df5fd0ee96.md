Agreed to assign council as responsible. 
Council term 29 plan already has an item on this
Budgeting tool started
KRs will be updated next call

### 7 March 24

 - Council has established a USD payment structure for all workers and also a Pay structure for Leads and in process of developing a pay structure for Council.
Leads pay structure - [**Transitioning Lead Salaries To USD-EMA30**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/817) 

### 8 March 2024

- Update as per Dmitry, we are now engaging with a 3rd party team (Giants web3) that will look into our tokenomics and payment structure. This input will hopefully help to finalize this workstream—there is a good chance we can do this before the end of the quarter.
- Pay will probably start being reviewed every 3 or 6 months and the improvements will hopefully lead to us having a better, more systematic approach to reviewing this in the future
- Council salary is still pending, can’t be actioned fully within this quarter.
- Infrastructure salary may still need review due to little competition for the role and recent downsizing / centralization concerns
- Builders, Marketing, HR, Content worker salaries have all been reviewed

### 30 April 2024

- Salaries reviewed
- Moved from JOY salaries → USDT nominated
