- Create social media marketing strategy
- Create educational content/infographics and post regularly

### 21 February 2024

- more resources need to collect this kind of data
- better use absolute number just bc we haven’t tracked this for prev quarter

### 8th March 2024

- It is being worked on and on track
- There is a community infographics and meme campaign, where they will be shared on Twitter and be retweeted by our main accounts
- Ambassador program will also be contributing to this key result
- Work is being done on figma templates for creators, CRTs, NFTs to highlight them better on social media
- Button will be added to gleev for “follow us on twitter”, should increase Twitter signups
- (all updates as per leet_joy, marketing WG lead)

we believe that was fully achieved but this problematic to properly measure 

Score: 100% 

Note: lets have data from across all platforms we use (via api?)

- CMC
- Twitter (X)
- Farcaster
- Discord
- Debank
- Telegram

Even make a related dashboard for tracking these numbers?
