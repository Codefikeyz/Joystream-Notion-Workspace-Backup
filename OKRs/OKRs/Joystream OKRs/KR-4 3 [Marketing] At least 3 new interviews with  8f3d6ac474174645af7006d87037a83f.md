### 8th March 2024

- resource restrictions per leetjoy (marketing WG lead)
- interviews are to be conducted by external parties
- some parties expect financial remuneration for conducting interviews
- still on track with KR
- decided to postpone is due to impending `nara` runtime upgrade and the likelihood that Joystream team will be too busy/hectic to do interviews
