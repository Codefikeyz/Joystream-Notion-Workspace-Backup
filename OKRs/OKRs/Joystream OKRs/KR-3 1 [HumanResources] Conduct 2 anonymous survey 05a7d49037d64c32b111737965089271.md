### 21 Feb 24

Suggestion 

- make this on a regular basis, once per council term (when we start with 30days council council terms)
- 1 anonymous survey is already made

### 7 Mar 2023

With the recent analysis of survey conducted and submitted to Council, HR is getting ready to conduct another survey at the end of the 30th term council with regards to the recent WG optimization and full USD based salary across all WGs and a better planning for the 1 month Councll term.

### 30 April 2023

Score: 100%
