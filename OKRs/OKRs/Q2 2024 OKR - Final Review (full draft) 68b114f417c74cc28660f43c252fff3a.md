### **O1: Provide quality values for bandwidth and latency (TTFB) accross geographical regions for which we are having sufficient traffic, keeping the cost of operation minimal.**

| **Description** | **Responsible Party** | **Current Score** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KR1.1: [if the SpeedTest comparison is successful for t = 30 days time window then the OKR is reached at 100% (meaning: good values for Latency and Bandwidth for June 2024)](https://www.notion.so/OKRs-Q2-2024-2e583262bea940009bb26799a55c832c?pvs=21) | Distributors | 0.2 | The main reason we haven't achieved this OKR is the lack of an enterprise-level CDN. Additionally, to improve, we should focus on specific locations and may need more operators globally. Our best approach would be to target the top 10 countries by traffic in the last 30 days and add one additional node in each of those locations. |
