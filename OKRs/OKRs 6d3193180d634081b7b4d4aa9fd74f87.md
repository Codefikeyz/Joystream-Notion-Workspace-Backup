## **Content WG**

**O1**

**Utility of JOY**

O1KR1: Get not less than 100 M JOY tx volume on all CRTs

- WG level KR: Ship incremental improvements of CRTs by end of Q2 (New" feature level bubbles for improved discoverability; CRT marketplace shown by default; Direct sale; Discovery improvements based on feeedback; Notifications; Trending tokens)

**Barrier Free Purchase**

O1KR2: ChangeNow modal in Gleev is visited by 5% of all users

**Community Engagement**

O1KR3: Hold 2 creator roundtable events

O1KR4: Grow creators Discord community to 300 participants (role = creator)

**O2**

Comment - since the metrics outlined under this objective have never been the focus, we do not have any imperical sensitivity levels on features delivered vs impact measured. Let's put arbitrary 30% and track regularly to be able to set realistic stretch targets for Q3. Same with NPS, this indicator would not be possible to improve within the quarter, but we can measure it and identify the aspects of product that can be worked on.

- KR2.1: Measure NPS and create roadmap targeting critical feedback items. (comment: I don't think NPS can be substantially increased over the course of 1.5 months)
- KR2.2: MAU and DAU to increase by 30%
- KR2.3: Average session duration increase by 30%
- KR2.4: Avg session number per user per month by 30%
- KR2.5: 30D retention rate increased by 30%

## Distribution

**mr_bovo**

I go through each objective and express thoughts / derived DWG objectives

### **O1**

Nothing to add

### **O2**

- I think the objective name is misleading: I believe we already have a niche and it's not technically a product market fit. I would simply change the name to say Increase Userbase (but that's simply a cosmetic change)
- Regarding values chosen, I agree with the one above by  ***@dmtr***, they are ambitious and that's fine
- Regarding deriving specific objectives for DWG, I am not fully sure how much improvements of the Content delivery network is needed in order to achieve the desired data. It's common sense to expect some causality (eg if the atlas video page takes 15s to load then user retention rate cannot increase because the website will become too laggy). In that regard I think the most concrete way I can proceed is to continue improving our TTFB and Bandwidth as they are the most important metric that will potentially deter user and permits (but not guarantee) achievement of KR2.(1-5). That's pretty much what the Distribution WG can do in this aspect.I will follow up with a detailed measurement process and target values as the subject is quite technical and not within the general spirit of this post

### **O3**

I have some points to this, that I have already discussed with some previous council members and Leads alike

- KR: 3.1 Meeting duration: Every scheduled meeting must have an established start and end time. (Time must be respected). Furthermore Meetings longer that 1h should be avoided as people usually start loosing focus.
- KR: 3.2 Meeting efficiency: Every meeting (whenever possible) should have an agenda planned in advance (to avoid detours) also at the end every meeting should have at least a clear list of actionable steps to take. I can take charge of this for the Infra alignment call

## **BWG**

### **O1**

1. Deliver Argo Ethereum bridge.

### **O2**

1. Deliver Metamask support for Atlas and Pioneer.

### **O3**

1. Deliver S3 support and archival mode support for storage node to drive costs down.
2. Deliver improvements to the report tool that will allow:
    1. Easy and reliable report generation.
    2. Collecting CRT metrics.

I know those are not proper KRs (progress is 0→1, not really measurable), but don't have an idea of how to state them differently. Happy to hear suggestions or other items worth adding for BWG.

## HR

**Codefikeyz**

O1

- Research ideas to increase creators community engagement ([Main focus](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344710710296646/1235575520436158597))
- Increase support by X% regarding community inquiry on JOY token purchase (recommend usage of video tutorials by ambassadors)

O2

- Conduct a bi-weekly training session for community managers to enhance product knowledge and support skills, aiming for an average NPS increase of 1 point each month. (NPS = handled by CWG)
- Co-facilitate 2 Creators rountable event in collaboration with CWG
- Establish a **community buddy program**, pairing new users with experienced community managers/members to provide guidance and support during their initial interactions with the platform, with the goal of improving the 30-day retention rate by [x4]% compared to the previous quarter. (For community members, this can be voluntary, where a comprehensive report of their activity is drafted and forwarded to the HR Lead, who examines the report and rewards member with X amount of token at the end of the term. This is totally subjective to and at the lead's discretion. Report is likened to HR community managers too)
