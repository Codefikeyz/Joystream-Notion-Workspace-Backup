# Membership one-pager

This is a very simple explanation of Membership on Joystream.

A membership is something a user can either be invited to or purchase. Depending on how the user signs up on Joystream they will either have their membership paid for by the DAO, another user or they can pay for it themselves.

There are currently 3 places where a new user can sign up for a membership for free, the funds for this come from a faucet that is funded by the Membership Working Group:

- [https://pioneerapp.xyz/](https://pioneerapp.xyz/)
- [https://gleev.xyz/](https://gleev.xyz/)
- [https://l1.media/](https://l1.media/)

A membership is required to use several parts of the DAO such as:

- Creating channels, videos, comments and likes
- Creating posts and threads on the on-chain forum
- Applying for the council, working groups

Some very limited parts of the DAO do not require membership, these are:

- Sending/recieving token transfers
- Validating, staking & nomination actions
- Voting for council members

A membership is a handle and profile that is associated with an `account`

- A membership handle looks like this: `my_cool_username`
- An account looks like this: `j4VEC6FcJtBrwYQKhBAoB6Rj83jDeVua6azuHBrri1zoksBkz`

If a user is `Gifted` or `Invited` (using a one-time use `Invitation`) their account will have a starting deposit that is `locked`. This `locked` deposit cannot be transferred and can only be used for a limited number of purposes such as:

- Creating channels, videos, comments and likes
- Creating posts and threads on the on-chain forum

Depending on how a new user signs up for Joystream there may be differences in what they have as an initial account balance and other items, this table explains it simply.
