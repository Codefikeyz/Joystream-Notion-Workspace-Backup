# Membership WG Report

Council term 7

## **1. Current group composition :**

- Tomato - lead

## **2. Budget for the Term**

The budget is still undergoing work as the purpose of the group develops.

Salaries:

- Current Lead salary is: 5.04k $JOY / week

Expenses:

- One refill of faucet address of 10k $JOY: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=1870](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=1870)
- There has been increased usage of the faucet because of the 2nd crew3 promotional initiative.

## **3. Work status for the Term=**

- Build a better understanding and create a 1 page document explaining how faucets and invitations work as there appears to be some confusion.
    - This was not completed in the last term and so is included for this term.
- Keep constant monitoring of the faucet address(es). If we get a large rise in user signups then this needs to be refilled more regularly.
    - Done - The faucet address was regularly monitored and was never empty.
- Keep monitoring of usage of the invitation feature, as this impacts the WG’s budget.
    - Done - There was no usage of the invitation feature.
- Continue with trying to get apps use to separate faucet addresses and/or try to find out from builders if faucet attribution is possible via the Query Node
    - I believe this is coming in the Ephesus runtime upgrade.
- During the last term the membership WG mint reached 0 for quite a period of time, I will work on improving communication of the mint level as when it is empty membership invitations do not function which is a problem!
    - Done - The budget never reached 0

## **4. Extra items**

Current membership use during council term 7:

- Gifted memberships (faucets): 170
- Bought/paid memberships: 5
- Invited memberships: 0

Notes:

- Based on forum activity (particularly forum thread 301) there are likely a number of sybil accounts in our membership directory. But there is no action I can take against these memberships. It may be worth looking into changing how the faucet works to make it a bit more sybil resistant.
- The low number of invited memberships is either because of lack of awareness/value proposition for users.
