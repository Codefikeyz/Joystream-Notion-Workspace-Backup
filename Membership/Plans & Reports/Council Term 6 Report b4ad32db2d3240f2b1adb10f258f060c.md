# Membership WG Report

Council term 6

## **1. Current group composition :**

- Tomato - lead

## **2. Budget for the Term**

The budget is still undergoing work as the purpose of the group develops.

Salaries:

- Current Lead salary is: 5.04k $JOY / week

Expenses:

- None
- The faucet address only used approximately 1000 JOY during the entire term (ending balance of ~6290 JOY) so did not require replenishment from Membership WG Budget

## **3. Work status for the Term**

- Begin discussion of membership proposal parameters (note: I wouldn’t consider this to be high priority, rather just a point of making sure all adjustable parameters on the DAO are discussed)
    - Completed - [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/290](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/290). There were no replies to the thread so it is assumed there is currently very little interest in changing the parameters
- Build a better understanding and create a 1 page document explaining how faucets and invitations work as there appears to be some confusion.
    - Not completed, will be completed next term
- Keep constant monitoring of the faucet address(es). If we get a large rise in user signups then this needs to be refilled more regularly.
    - Completed
- Continue with trying to get apps use to separate faucet addresses and/or try to find out from builders if faucet attribution is possible via the Query Node
    - Still waiting on separate attribution being implemented in QN
- During the last term the membership WG mint reached 0 for quite a period of time, I will work on improving communication of the mint level as when it is empty membership invitations do not function which is a problem!
    - Due to lower faucet level usage and also increased monitoring this never became an issue.

## **4. Extra items**

Current membership use during council term 6:

- Gifted memberships (faucets): 88
- Bought/paid memberships: 1
- Invited memberships: 0

Notes:

- I did not notice any activity resembling sybil attacks
- The low number of invited memberships is either because of lack of awareness/value proposition for users.
