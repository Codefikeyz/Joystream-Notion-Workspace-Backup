## **1. Current group composition :**

- Lead: @tomato

# 2. Planned Budget for the Term

**Planned budget:** 

The budget is still in development as faucet use has been quite high, it has currently been paid for by myself (and adovrn refilled it once and I reimbursed them). Currently 15k $JOY has been spent on the faucet with about 3k remaining

**Purpose:** 

# 3. Group Priorities for the Term

- Identify faucet addresses and current use rates
- Try to get apps to use separate addresses
- Begin discussion of user verification requirements. This seems like it would require a pre-proposal to be approved by the council.
- Gather statistics of faucet use as well as current membership trends
- Begin discussion of the various proposals relevant to the membership WG (fees, initial balances & referral cuts)
- Start working on council secretary role
