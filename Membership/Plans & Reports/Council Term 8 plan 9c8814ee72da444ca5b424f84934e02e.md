## **1. Current group composition :**

- Lead: @tomato

# 2. Planned Budget for the Term

**Planned budget:** 

- The budget is still in development—the group is new and has some different ways of using the budget compared to other groups.
- Current Lead salary is: 5.04k $JOY / week
- There is currently no plan or expected need to hire additional workers at this stage.
- Other expenses include:
    - Faucet use (these are periodically refilled via discretionary funding). The current faucet balance is ~12k $JOY and depending upon usage it may require refilling from time to time.
    - Invitation use (invitations are funded by the membership’s budget autonomously). This feature currently has very minimal usage but could unexpectedly increase, there is no way to really anticipate or control its usage.

# 3. Group Priorities for the Term

- Monitor the `Ephesus` runtime upgrade and if it has any impact on the membership system.
- Build a better understanding and create a 1 page document explaining how faucets and invitations work as there appears to be some confusion.
    - This was not completed in the last term and so is included for this term.
- Keep constant monitoring of the faucet address(es). If we get a large rise in user signups then this needs to be refilled more regularly.
- Keep monitoring of usage of the invitation feature, as this impacts the WG’s budget.
- Ensure the Membership WG budget does not reach 0 as this prevents people from being able to use the invitation feature.
