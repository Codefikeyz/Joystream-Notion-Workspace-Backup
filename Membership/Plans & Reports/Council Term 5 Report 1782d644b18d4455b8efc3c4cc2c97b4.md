# Membership WG Report

Council term 5

## **1. Current group composition :**

- Tomato - lead

## **2. Budget for the Term**

The budget is still undergoing work as the purpose of the group develops.

Expenses:

- 25k $JOY was reimbursed to myself for funds that were spent refilling faucets: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=1219](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=1219) Hopefully from now on these funds will come directly from the membership WG mint rather than be reimbursed.
    - The 25k $JOY was what I’d consider to be quite a high amount as we had a lot of signups from the crew3 promotional initiative. This makes it an unreliable figure for predicting future faucet use.
- No membership invites were used (these funds come from the membership WG mint) due to them either not being used by anyone or because the mint was empty for some amount of time (invites will not work if the mint is empty)

## **3. Work status for the Term**

- Identify faucet addresses and current use rates
    - This has been done: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=726](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=726)
- Try to get apps to use separate addresses
    - I have requested this however it may end up being that attribution is used on faucets rather than separate addresses: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=728](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/169?post=728)
- Begin discussion of user verification requirements. This seems like it would require a pre-proposal to be approved by the council.
    - This has been done: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/170](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/170) However I get the impression that this is not of a significant priority at this point in time and would currently have limited use, so I have not continued or pushed discussion much further on it so far.
- Gather statistics of faucet use as well as current membership trends
    - Covered in Extra items section
- Begin discussion of the various proposals relevant to the membership WG (fees, initial balances & referral cuts)
    - This has not been done just yet but will probably start during the next council term.
- Start working on council secretary role
    - This has begun here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/257](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/257)

## **4. Extra items**

Current membership use during council term 5:

- Gifted memberships (faucets): 674
- Bought memberships: 5
- Invited memberships: 0

Notes:

- I did not notice any activity resembling sybil attacks
- The low number of invited memberships is either because of lack of awareness/value proposition for users and/or because the membership WG mint was empty (meaning all invitation attempts would fail)
