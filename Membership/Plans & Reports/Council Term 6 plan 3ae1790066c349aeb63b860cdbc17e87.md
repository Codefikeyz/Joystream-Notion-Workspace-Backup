## **1. Current group composition :**

- Lead: @tomato

# 2. Planned Budget for the Term

**Planned budget:** 

- The budget is still in development—the group is new and has some different ways of using the budget compared to other groups.
- Current Lead salary is: 5.04k $JOY / week
- Other expenses include:
    - Faucet use (these are periodically refilled via discretionary funding). The current faucet balance is ~7659 $JOY and depending upon usage it may require refilling
    - Invitation use (invitations are funded by the membership’s budget autonomously)

# 3. Group Priorities for the Term

- Begin discussion of membership proposal parameters (note: I wouldn’t consider this to be high priority, rather just a point of making sure all adjustable parameters on the DAO are discussed)
- Build a better understanding and create a 1 page document explaining how faucets and invitations work as there appears to be some confusion.
- Keep constant monitoring of the faucet address(es). If we get a large rise in user signups then this needs to be refilled more regularly.
- Continue with trying to get apps use to separate faucet addresses and/or try to find out from builders if faucet attribution is possible via the Query Node
- During the last term the membership WG mint reached 0 for quite a period of time, I will work on improving communication of the mint level as when it is empty membership invitations do not function which is a problem!
