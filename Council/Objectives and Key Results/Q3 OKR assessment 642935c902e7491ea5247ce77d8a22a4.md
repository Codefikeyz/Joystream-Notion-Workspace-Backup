| KR-4.2 Validators count not less than 50 by the end of quarter. | Council | 0.7 | The validator size was increased to 43, but any further increment was postponed due to insufficient information regarding whether new nodes could actually enhance network security or if they have the same owners as nodes in the active set.  |
