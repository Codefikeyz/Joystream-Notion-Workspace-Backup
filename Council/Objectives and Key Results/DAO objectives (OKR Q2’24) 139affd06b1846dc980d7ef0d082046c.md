### **Objectives by 0x2bc**

We should 

- “Ensure product market fit”,
- let everybody know about our project, and
- not run out of money, at the same time.

**other thoughts**

- make Joystream platform #1 for capitalizing their video content for niche (long-tail) content creators
- has accelerated growth in new content creators and video uploads

### Feedback from bedeho

- top-tier infrastructure is overkill
