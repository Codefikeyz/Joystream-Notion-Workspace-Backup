## Meeting Note

### CWG Status Update

**User Snap NPS:**

- Launched the User Snap NPS survey.

**Product-Market Fit Objective:**

- The product-market fit objective can be aligned from the organizational level to the product level.

**CRT Experience:**

- Currently limited but will be a priority in the coming weeks.

**Compensating Viewers/Engagement Leaderboard:**

- Engagement leaderboards will not be a permanent feature for all interactions. They will be used for events that generate buy pressure, creating a leaderboard and rewarding a fraction of the top participants.

**A/B Testing Campaign:**

- Running an A/B test campaign comparing two landing pages.

**Comments:**

- Consider rewarding users who perform economically significant actions, such as buying NFTs and CRTs, through airdrops.
- Address the low landing page hits for the YPP. Discuss strategies to replicate the success of last November.
- The current content KRs are not achievable within the remaining time. Adjust the numbers to fit reality (0x2bc).
