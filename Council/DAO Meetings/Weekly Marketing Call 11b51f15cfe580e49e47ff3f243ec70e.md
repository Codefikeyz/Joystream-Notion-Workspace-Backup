6. **Video Content Consumers:** Highlighting the value of Joystream to general viewers, which in turn will draw more creators.

**Action Items:**

### **Platform Utilization and Growth**

**Opportunities to leverage different platforms** for greater visibility and engagement. The following channels were prioritized:

- **TikTok & Facebook:** Platforms with a high concentration of monetized content. The goal is to use short-form videos and educational posts to target creators and viewers.
- **Reddit & Crypto Forums:** Channels to engage the crypto-savvy audience. Joystream should post in relevant threads/forums for organic reach.
- **LinkedIn:** Improve industry visibility by having Joystream executives and employees actively connect and engage with other professionals, showcasing Joystream's unique offerings.

**Action Items:**

- **TikTok & YouTube Shorts:** Janine to begin creating short-form videos using existing Joystream content, targeting both viewers and creators.
- **Facebook Presence:** Janine to manage Facebook content and aim for simultaneous posts across all platforms for brand consistency.
- **Reddit & Forums:** Assign a team member to start posting regularly on Reddit and other cryptocurrency forums (e.g., Bitcoin Talk, CoinMarketCap) to increase awareness.

### **Lead Generation and Onboarding Enhancements**

We talked about **lead generation** to capture potential content creators and token holders. To achieve this, the following tactics were discussed:

- **Multiple Sign-up Touchpoints:** Simplify and streamline the sign-up process for capturing emails through:
    - Pop-ups on Joystream’s website.
    - Social media ads targeted at potential creators and investors.
    - Collaborations with other platforms to exchange exclusive content for contact info.
- **Lead Magnets:** Create free resources like guides, or access to exclusive platform features to incentivize sign-ups.

**Action Items:**

- Develop pop-up templates and ads for capturing leads.
- Create a series of lead magnets, such as "How to Monetize Content on Joystream" and "Crypto Investment Guide."

### **Influencer Partnerships & Referral Program**

Another idea of **partnering with influencers** in both the crypto and content creation spaces to boost Joystream's credibility and reach. These influencers will serve as brand ambassadors, creating a halo effect with their audience.

A **referral program** was also proposed, incentivizing users to bring in new members by offering rewards, such as:

- Financial incentives.
- Exclusive platform content.
- Access to premium features.

**Action Items:**

- Identify influencers within the crypto and creator space to approach for partnerships.
- Draft a referral program outline, including potential rewards.

### **Content Syndication and Rich Media Enhancement**

Joystream can **syndicate pre-existing content** by republishing it on high-traffic cryptocurrency and content creation websites. This can include:

- Guest blog posts.
- Sponsored content.
- Collaborative articles and interviews.

In addition, there was a call to **increase the use of rich media** (e.g., summary cards, photo cards, video cards) to make posts more visually engaging.

**Action Items:**

- Janine to research top cryptocurrency sites and forums for content syndication opportunities.
- Start A/B testing different content formats and visuals to measure audience engagement.

### **Content Calendar & Weekly Marketing Goals**

- **Content Calendar:** Janine is tasked with drafting a **content calendar** for the week that will include specific social media posts, especially for Twitter and Facebook. The content should be scheduled and consistent across platforms to maintain visibility.
- **Twitter Spaces:** Weekly Twitter Spaces will be held, though there might be chances of bi-weekly events instead.
- Create and share the content calendar for the next week, including tweets and Facebook posts.
- Prepare for next week’s Twitter Space.
