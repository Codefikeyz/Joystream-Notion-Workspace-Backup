### Meeting Notes

**Summary:**
The meeting covered updates on the Argo bridge, updating the Gantt chart, multisig testing, pauser elections, AMM and DEX aggregator research, and the arbitrage setup. We also discussed the potential for an earlier launch, outstanding tasks, and strategies for the successful launch of the bridge.

**Discussion Points**

**Timeline and Focus Area:**

- **Updated Timeline:** The launch of the Argo bridge has been tentatively shifted to August 18, 2024. However, there is potential to move the launch to an earlier date, possibly August 15, depending on the completion of critical tasks.
- **Focus Areas:** The most important tasks before the launch include multisig testing, internal guides for signers, and setting up the arbitrage strategy.

**Multisig Testing:**

- Multisig tests on the testnet are nearly complete. All participants, except Jenny, were able to proceed. The issue with Jenny's Joystream address is being addressed, and a replacement for Jenny may be sought, ensuring they can use a hardware wallet.

**Internal Guides for Signers:**

- Guides for signers have been completed and distributed. No further clarifications have been requested, and the task is marked as done. Updates may be needed once the system is operational.

**Pauser Elections:**

- No significant progress has been made. We discussed the possibility of using existing multisig members as pausers. The council is expected to finalize the list of pausers, with a minimum of five members recommended.

**AMM and DEX Aggregator Research:**

- We decided to use Uniswap v3 as the primary AMM, with Aerodrome as a potential secondary option.
- Deployment of smart contracts on base is required to apply for Aerodrome. Leetjoy to handle this once contracts are deployed.

**Arbitrage Setup:**

- Awaiting an update from Mr. Bovo. There is uncertainty about whether the arbitrage strategy will be ready by launch. We discussed the possibility of launching the AMM without the arbitrage setup and observing the results. Also, there is a concern for understanding the arbitrage strategy thoroughly to avoid financial losses.
- We need to agree on the parameters for the AMM and liquidity pools, including liquidity levels, commission rates, and total liquidity.

**UI Completion:**

- The UI is nearly complete, with only minor tasks remaining. It is expected to be fully ready by Tuesday, August 13.
- Add security measures for data accuracy, a FAQ section, and a disclaimer.

**Marketing Plan:**

- A draft will be prepared to announce the launch on Joystream blog
- Promotion on social channels and Web3 communities.
- Twitter ads targeting Base and other chains.
- Ongoing search for partnership with influencers
- A potential idea to run a trading competition post-launch was discussed but will be reconsidered after the pair is stable.

 **Others:**

- Domain Setup to be done shortly on Joystream website
- A proposal for the council to pass, detailing the operator multisig, pauser roles, bridging fees, and allowing bridging to base.
