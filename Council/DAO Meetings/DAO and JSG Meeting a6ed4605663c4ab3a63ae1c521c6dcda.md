Meeting Summary
April 6th - 11.00 CET
Attendees: The council, MWG Lead and Bedeho

1. **Marketing efforts with JSG** - DAO can handle preparing campaigns in coordination with JSG - JSG would be happy to give the necessary support on their side
- Need to figure out strategically which Marketing efforts will be done
- DAO can start promoting YPP in multiple ways - video ads run on YT targeting only Cryptocurrency audience - A list of initiatives will be prepared with the cost and specifications
- JSG, Dimitry to be specific has collected contacts for potential YPP onboarding. MWG has also collected contacts by themselves. Both parties will coordinate for more efficient onboarding of content creators

1. **Joystream Speaker** - Bedeho is comfortable and open to doing AMAs, talks, and appearances on other platforms
- DAO will provide the strategic value of each possible collaboration and provide a plan and schedule in advance
- Strategic value needs to be determined prior to these efforts and MWG will cover the necessary preparations

1. [**SEO-Joystream.org**](http://seo-joystream.org/)
- JSG has not given too much attention to this topic to this date and is willing and happy to work with the DAO for further enhancements to [Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/)
- Specific keywords needs to be identified like “decentralized media platforms” - will work on the distribution of contents and link so the weight of backlink will grow over time
- Need to specify what needs to be done in the website, the goals, and the expected outcomes
- MWG thought about hiring a part-time SEO specialist to come up with an SEO strategy for improving the optimization of the website [Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/)

1. **YT unblocking YPP**
- JSG is expecting this issue to be resolved in a few days or so - no definite time - can verify with Dimitry
- There were no remarks from YT, YT seemed not bothered about Gleev being connected to YPP, JSG is doing  their best to get this fixed asap

1. **Listing - there is progress**
- DAO should work on marketing initiatives to get good outcomes prior to listing
- Regarding IDO - IEO - needs to determine the value it can bring in a deeper sense - need to evaluate the cost - more research is needed
-IDO/IEO could be a good way to get listed - a good way to market Joy as it increases the user base - the people who participate can get engaged in the project - in the long run, it might give positive results to the project
- Need to research the projects who did the same and try to contact them

1. **Polkadot Parachain**
- The strategic value of having a parachain is very low for Joystream
- Inoperability angle - relevance of this is very low - impact won’t be that good
- Parachain is not the only existing mechanism
- Pay off is low - security is not a big issue right now- validator can be coordinated with overtime - cost in terms of engineering and risks are high
- JSG do not have plans on doing it - but the DAO can make a compelling argument and they can consider

1. **JIP and Constitution**
- The Constitution is more of a holistic document on how different policy questions are answered at any given time
- The Constitution is not supposed to be changed often but it can be edited/modified over time depending on the necessity
- Constitution is a more fundamental thing
- Constitution and JIP will be launched soon -JSG is currently working on a new runtime upgrade where the JIP will be used to deploy it
- JIP will be running first probably before the constitution
