**Agendas:**

**Runtime Upgrade (Parameters of Council Election Period):**

- Extensive discussion highlighted the paramount importance of the Council's role in making decisions that serve the best interests of the project, prioritizing this over attempts to align with public opinion.
- A deliberation on the necessity of introducing an idle period during elections gained prominence. This idle period would serve to minimize distractions for the incumbent Council, allowing them to focus on their responsibilities rather than reelection campaigns.
- An in-depth exploration took place regarding the extension of the election period. It was observed that while candidates are often well-known members of the community and may not require extensive introductions to voters, there remains a critical need for reevaluation. Additionally, a longer voting period was seen as a means to empower voters with the freedom to make informed decisions, especially on emerging topics, thus facilitating the exchange of fresh ideas.

**Q4 OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**

- A comprehensive discussion ensued regarding the establishment of minimum and maximum inflation rates. Participants examined the potential impact of these rates on the project's sustainability.
- A central theme emerged, emphasizing the setting of OKR goals based on aspiration. The intention was to guide the community toward long-term objectives rather than easily achievable, short-term goals.
- The critical role of NFTs in community engagement was discussed at length, exploring strategies to increase their production.
- Strategies to enhance Joystream as a crypto project took the spotlight, including the proposal to encourage significant token staking by Founding Members and JSG FMs for elections, thus promoting active participation.
- The need for a legal adviser to navigate complex legal matters was acknowledged, though the decision was left open for further consideration.
- The importance of an SDK for streamlined integration was highlighted, emphasizing its potential to expand the project's reach.
- A proposal aimed at broadening community involvement was put forth. This initiative sought to integrate 10 new members into the DAO active community, diversifying participation beyond Founding Members and facilitating discussions on forums and governance.

**Onboarding New Community Members:**

- A detailed exploration of the need to onboard ten new key members into working groups or council roles took place. The objective was to tap into a range of expertise and perspectives.
- Strategies for attracting and onboarding new members were examined, with an emphasis on fostering an inclusive and dynamic community.
- The possibility of implementing an ambassador program to achieve onboarding goals was discussed, along with the proposal to offer bounties for specific tasks to incentivize participation.
- The overarching principle remained the preservation of open opportunities to accommodate organic community growth.

**Multi-Sig Election Results:**

- A brief mention was made of the successful approval of the DAO treasury signer list, a consensus reached by the council, featuring the inclusion of several community members, demonstrating collective decision-making.

**DAO Budgeting and Inflation Control:**

- A concise discussion centered on DAO budgeting and inflation control, highlighting the project's financial planning.
- A proposed allocation of 15 million $JOY for the next quarter was introduced, though careful consideration of budget projections without undue focus on token price predictions was encouraged.
- It was noted that staking could potentially have a significant impact, with a hypothetical scenario presented where staking reached 50%, underlining the importance of monitoring these dynamics for financial stability.
