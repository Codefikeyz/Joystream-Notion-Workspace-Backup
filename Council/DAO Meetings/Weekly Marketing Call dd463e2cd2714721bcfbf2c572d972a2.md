## Meeting Note

Highlights Since Last Meeting:

- Welcome news with approximately 3,000 new users and 126,000 returning users, mirroring growth on [joystream.org](http://joystream.org/).
- Consistent user engagement from the USA, sourcing from CMC and CoinGecko.

Planned Core Objectives for the Term Include:

- Launching phase 2 of the ambassadorship program.
- Executing the creator token campaign.
- Utilizing analytics to identify the most effective channels and potentially increasing campaign budgets accordingly.
- Continuation of the CMC campaign.

Ambassadors Program:

- Phase 1 review completed, with approximately $116k in $JOY rewards distributed.
- Q&A testing planned for creator token with ambassadors, who will receive tokens for participation and feedback.
- Transitioning ambassador management to the main Discord to mitigate spam.
- Finalized plans for phase 2, including Zealy quests; to-dos include setting up an application form, branding, and creating a Notion space and announcement.

Other Group Activities:

- MWG workers actively posting videos on CMC, resulting in 40% of Gleev visitors originating from CMC.
- Designer tasked with creating illustrations for phase 2.
- Engaging in discussions on X with the #Joystream hashtag.

Progress on X Ads:

- Initial test yielded positive results; budget allocated for CRT launch targeting the US, South America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, with plans to include the Middle East.
- Proposal to allocate a small weekly budget for ads similar to Lemon Studios video.
- Farcaster concept: snapshot of Dracula creators joining Gleev to receive airdropped $JOY tokens; additional data gathering underway.
- Need for a copywriter to generate press releases about the creator token for distribution to media outlets.
- Discussion on hiring a marketing agency deemed premature; focus should remain on current strategies.
- Proposal for additional rewards for MWG workers for their dedicated efforts.
