## Meeting Note

### CWG Operations Review

- OKRs meetings scheduled, where potential actions may arise. Lead submitted a preliminary copy, although it may contain some assumptions that need validation before finalization.
- Segment completion allows us to utilize UTM tags efficiently.
- The Syncing allowances have been finalized, with the model signed off last week.
- Progress continues on addressing creator engagement issues for Gleev. The landing page structure is finalized, and Lead provided feedback to Magda regarding necessary copy changes. Development issues will be drafted tomorrow.
- Notion for creator engagement programs is underway. Lead created a page announcing its work-in-progress status. Overall, the creator portal is progressing well. Additional details on claiming rewards will be incorporated.
- YPP sign-ups saw an increase compared to last week, including 8 silver channels and one gold. With refreshed marketing activities, we anticipate further growth in holistic creator rewards. Pending council consideration is the decision to transition YPP payment from JSG. Lead drafted communications to creators regarding changes in the payout period and information on creator rewards.
- Upcoming tasks include building the OKRs dashboard, researching competition for engagement, and supporting CRT release and creator rewards program operations.
- Gleev has released ChangeNow features for buying tokens, with WalletConnect set for the next release.
- Feedback from Leet_joy suggests pinning videos made in the dev environment, providing guidance on navigating CRT use.
