## Meeting Note

### **OPs Update:**

- **Promotion of Creator Engagement Programs and Rewards**
    - We have launched blog posts to highlight improvements in our creator engagement programs and rewards.
    - Notable update: Referral payouts. Today, we distributed over 10 million $JOY, and we are committed to maintaining a similar budget over the next 6 to 12 months.
    - **Feedback Collection**: Ambassadors will provide feedback on the new earning potentials in the coming week.

### Concerns:

1. **MWG Efforts in the Last Two Weeks**
    - Focus Areas: Ambassador program, Zeally campaign, and pre-roll videos from creators.
2. **Tracking Results**
    - Referral rewards can be tracked through the videos.
    - Results from Zeally tasks will be evaluated at the end of the program.
3. **Campaigns for Non-Web3 Creators**
    - Current Focus: Majority of creators are not from the Web3 space.
    - Strategy: Selecting creators from various niches, particularly targeting cheaper regions and prominent YouTubers in those areas.
4. **Hiring for Twitter Management**
    - **Current Status**: No progress has been made on hiring a dedicated person to manage Twitter for JOYSTREAM-related topics.
5. **Engaging Desired Twitter Audience**
    - **Action Plan**: We are considering hiring an agency to handle audience engagement and improve our Twitter presence.

### Action Items:

1. **Promotional Strategy**
    - Increase the use of video content, as it tends to be more engaging than written content.
    - Utilize platforms like TikTok for promotions.
2. **Marketing Strategy Review**
    - Consider consulting a marketing agency to review and enhance our current marketing strategy.
3. **Ambassadorship Program Expansion**
    - Broaden the ambassadorship pool.
    - Instead of meticulously screening ambassadors, fast-track those who demonstrate impactful activities and then move on to new sets of ambassadors with different audiences.
4. **Incentives for Larger Channels and KOLs**
    - Offer more substantial rewards to larger channels and key opinion leaders (KOLs).
    - Negotiate rewards with better terms, such as vested rewards linked to lead generation.

**End of Session.**
