Meeting Minutes:

- Discussed about Rules for the Next WeekNew Rules :

 • A member of Joystream at least 2days before• Have an account on gleev

• Have an account on Pioneer• Have a telegram & Discord account 

- Discussion about Feedbacks from Survey

• Decrease waiting time from 50 secs to 20 seconds

• Decrease answer time for answer to 10 seconds

• Leave the questions at 25 and maximize time

- Discussion about direct invitation to members

• Make a list of active participants and send DM invitations

• This creates a bigger sense of belonging 

- Discussion on Rewards

• Set new positions: 1st to 7th

• Reward the 1st to 3rd with their normal price• Reward 4th to 7th with 300 $JOY each to be discussed with Council during WG plan feedback for term 10 on 9th  May, 11 CET

• The idea of using NfTs for reward will increase participation and create a sense of belonging to the community but we can not issue out image Nfts at this time nor have them in store to give out, hopefully in the near future we can be able to execute this.

- Discussion of New Ideas with Community Engagement

• We can make a mid-week quiz with diverse questions about what's really happening in the DAO to promote participation.

• Initiate that the Community Engagement suggestion task be incorporated into the Zealy campaign and have participants from diverse communities suggest engagement activities that they would like to see happen in Joystream and earn $JOY rewards.
