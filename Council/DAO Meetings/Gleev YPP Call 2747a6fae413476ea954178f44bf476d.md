## Meeting Note

- **Decline in Sign-ups**: The recent increase in sign-up rewards hasn't led to a proportional increase in sign-ups. This is evident from the fact that there's been only one gold channel this week. Jenny raised concerns about this trend, questioning why there's a lack of gold channels. It's crucial to address this decline in sign-ups despite the higher rewards.
- **Engaging Gold Tier Creators**: Per Dmitry's suggestion, the team plans to engage directly with gold tier creators to understand their perspective on referrals. There's a hypothesis that bronze channels may struggle to attract gold channels, which impacts the referral process. By soliciting feedback from gold tier creators, the team aims to gain insights into why they aren't generating referral links.
- **Experimentation with Sign-up Rewards and Landing Page**: To address the decline in sign-ups, there's a proposal to reduce sign-up rewards and experiment with a unified landing page for creators. This initiative aims to streamline the onboarding process and improve engagement. Additionally, engagement activities will be integrated into the dashboard, providing creators with easy access to relevant information. There's also a consideration to create a new landing page with simplified messaging to enhance user experience.
- **Understanding Changes Leading to Decline**: Bedeho emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying changes contributing to the decline in sign-ups. It's not sufficient to attribute the decline solely to the absence of changes. Therefore, there's a need to analyze the factors driving this trend and devise strategies to reverse it. One proposal is to maintain the sign-up reward for bronze channels at $2 to incentivize their participation.
- **Brandon's Update on Creator Onboarding**: Brandon provided an update on the ongoing efforts to onboard creators and diversify their earning opportunities on Joystream. This includes exploring different ways creators can earn, such as through NFTs, royalties, fixed-price selling, or auctions. The focus for the week is to onboard each creator to at least three earning avenues, fostering their long-term engagement with the platform.
- **Refocusing Message to Gold Tier Creators**: Tomato highlighted the need to tailor the messaging for gold tier creators. These creators may already have lucrative sponsorship deals from platforms like YouTube or sponsorships from companies like Shadow Legends or Nord VPN. As such, the current YPP sign-up reward may not be compelling enough for them. Refocusing the message to emphasize non-monetary benefits could attract their interest.
- **Technical Issues**: Dmitry addressed reports of users encountering difficulties opening certain videos on mobile devices. This issue is attributed to transcoding issues, which need to be resolved promptly to ensure a seamless viewing experience for users across all platforms.
