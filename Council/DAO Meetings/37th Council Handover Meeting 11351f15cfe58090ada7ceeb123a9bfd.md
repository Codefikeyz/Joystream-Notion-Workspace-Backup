## Meeting Note

### **Term Highlights from the 36th Term Council (Leetjoy)**

- **Council Consensus Issues:**
    
    No consensus was reached on the spending and scope of works, resulting in no approved plan by three council members (CMs). Two different council plans were proposed with different budgets; one plan received two votes and was moved forward.
    
- **Social Layer Experiment:**
    
    Proposals from JSGenesis were introduced to experiment with the social layer, involving council members in Joystream governance. Implementation is ongoing.
    
- **Tangem Wallet Settlement:**
    
    Settled with 177 Tangem wallets at a 40% discount. Two invoices were paid, and the wallets will be shipped to the JSG address in Norway.
    
- **Infrastructure Compensation:**
    
    Compensation (approximately 2.4k USDT) was distributed to storage distribution workers for servers across different networks (Ethereum, Optimism, Binance).
    
- **YouTube Sync Issues:**
    
    Ongoing problems with YouTube sync due to changes in API access policies. A solution is in progress, with impacts on the number of videos uploaded on Joystream.
    
- **Budget Cuts and Inflation:**
    
    The council approved the EMA 30 cap at 0.015 cents (proposal number 965).
    
- **Bridge and AMM Developments:**
    - **Argo Bridge Launch:** Smart contract 964 has been launched; Argo Bridge app is hosted on [Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/), with test transfers executed.
    - **Liquidity Provisions:** 1.5 million JOY tokens moved to Base and 10,000 USDT to ETH Admin Multisig on the Base network for use in AMM on Uniswap.
    - **Signers and Pausers List Approved:** Responsible for the bridge.
- **Other Operational Matters:**
    - **Marketing Plan for Argo Bridge Launch:** Discussed in the last marketing call.
    - **Content Working Group Changes:** The previous content working group lead was released, and a transition for YPP payments management was initiated.
    - **Supporting Colossus Nodes:** PR is under review.

### **Working Group Updates:**

- **Marketing Working Group (Leetjoy):**
    - Ambassador program is active, with new members from South America creating video content.
    - Ongoing search for a content manager to improve social media presence. Twitter access issues are being resolved.
    - Active campaigns on CoinMarketCap and preparation for promoting Joystream Base Bridge after its launch.
- **Distribution Working Group (Mr. Bovo):**
    - Stable operations during the past term. Transition in leadership due to the resignation of the current lead.
- **HR Working Group (Codefikeyz):**
    - No new recruitment in the last term.
    - Modifications in the creators' roundtable and community engagement strategies.
    - Faucet funded with 100k JOY, but activities have slowed.
    - YouTube sync remains a primary community inquiry concern.
- **Storage Working Group (Yassir):**
    - No major changes; stable operations.

### **Council Recommendations:**

- Focus on Q3 OKRs related to market cap and product-market fit.
- Open lead positions for those who resigned.
- Reevaluate and possibly overhaul the YPP reward program to eliminate low-quality users.
- Finalize and implement Uniswap V3 into production quickly.
- Continue to optimize server costs and explore deep storage options for archival purposes.
- Address Twitter access issues for the marketing team.

### 

### **Discussions and Recommendations:**

- **Community Building Fund (Tomato):**
    - Limited progress due to a lack of high-quality users joining the Discord. Efforts to attract high-quality users continue, but the current YPP design is ineffective.
- Discussion on the next steps for infrastructure leads and content management.
- Consensus on the need to improve the onboarding of high-quality users and address inefficiencies in the current reward program.
