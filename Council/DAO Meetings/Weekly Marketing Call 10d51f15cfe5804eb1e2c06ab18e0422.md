### Meeting Notes

### **Community Engagement**

- **Twitter Space Discussion:**
    - Plan to organize a Twitter Space discussion post-launch, potentially as a fireside chat.
    - Efforts will be made to engage Base representatives to join these spaces and to boost Joystream announcements on Base.
    - A challenge was noted, Base only promoting projects built on base chain, but there might be an opportunity with the bridge smart contract built on base chain.
    - Identify and engage with projects in the Base ecosystem for potential collaboration, focusing on having their content on Joystream.
    - Conduct research on Twitter Spaces and events happening within the Base ecosystem and participate in notable spaces.

### **Trust Wallet Listing**

- **Focus:** Getting Joystream listed on Trust Wallet.
    - Klaudiusz will review and improve the application before submission.
    - Engagement with the Trust Wallet team directly after application submission to increase credibility.
    - Joystream needs to create a Uniswap pool before applying.
    - There are guidelines like having 10,000 token holders and 15,000 transactions, which Joystream meets. The need for a security audit was discussed, with a partial audit possibly being sufficient.

- Aerodrome application will be submitted after creating liquidity on Uniswap.
    - There are guidelines about trading volume, but these appear negotiable. We will attempt to get in contact with the Aerodrome team for further clarification.

### **Twitter Account Access Issues**

- The DAO has faced several issues accessing and fully utilizing the official Twitter account (e.g., paying for services, hosting spaces). The account is controlled by JS Genesis, not the DAO.
- There is a ongoing discussion with Bedeho to request full access for the DAO to better manage marketing efforts.
    - Previous attempts to run a separate DAO Twitter account resulted in a ban by Twitter for impersonation.
    - Engage with Bedeho to discuss the possibility of giving the DAO access to the Twitter account. A formal proposal might be needed.

### **Content Production**

- Content creation is mainly handled by ambassadors. There is a lack of educational and infographic materials.
- Hiring a content manager to produce more comprehensive content, including videos, graphics, and educational materials to better explain Joystream’s operations and ecosystem.

**Question**

- **What is the timeline for Producing Marketing Materials?**
    - Current delay due to lack of dedicated resources. Plans to ramp up once a content manager is hired.
