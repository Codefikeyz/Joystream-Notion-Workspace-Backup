**Council Status Update**

The council showcased its achievements, highlighting a significant milestone of successfully burning 15 million $JOY tokens. This deliberate action served as a proactive measure against potential security risks and malicious activities aimed at the council's treasury, reiterating their commitment to financial security. Collaboratively, with the HR department, the council adopted a weekly summary report process to ensure the community stays informed about the project's ongoing progress. This transparent initiative fosters inclusivity and engagement among community members.

Beyond token management, the council directed attention to user experience by implementing improvements across Discord servers, enhancing the overall community interaction. A noteworthy shift was the council's endorsement of the BWG reward model, emphasizing project-based compensation proposals over traditional AP-based measurements. This strategic move encourages more impactful contributions, aligning incentives for project growth and development. These collective efforts underscore the council's forward-looking approach and commitment to the project's advancement.
