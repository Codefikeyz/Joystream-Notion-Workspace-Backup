**2. Q4 OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**

**Key Result 1.1:** Decrease the average "Time To First Byte" by 20% and increase "Streaming Bandwidth" by 20%. It is crucial to ensure that these performance goals are adjusted according to actual performance metrics, maintaining a data-driven approach.

**Key Result 1.3:** A review of the calculation method for Video NFT total trading volume is necessary. Consideration should be given to increasing rewards for high-quality NFTs to align with this Key Result.

**Key Result 1.4:** To achieve an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 30% among content creators surveyed, HR will develop a robust evaluation system to gauge creator satisfaction and their likelihood to refer others to our project.

**Key Result 1.5:** Aim to have at least 100 Joystream-related review videos posted on YouTube by the end of Q4. This goal should focus on the achievements within the 4th quarter.

**Key Result 1.6:** Increase the total rewards distributed by the Content Working Group to content creators by 30%. Ensure a mechanism is in place to accurately track unclaimed channel rewards within the DAO.

**Key Result 1.7:** Organize a minimum of 5 community events or workshops during the quarter aimed at educating and engaging content creators. Collaborative efforts between HR and the Marketing Working Group will be pivotal in achieving this goal.

**Key Result 2.1:** List Joystream on at least 3 CEX (Centralized Exchanges), with a strategic emphasis on securing stable funds to support this initiative.

**Key Result 2.2:** Ensure Joystream support on at least 2 cold wallets, with progress already made through engagement with Tangem and the presence of Parity Signer.

**Key Result 2.3:** Target at least 15% of Joystream's total token supply to be used in validator staking. This requires active engagement and incentives for token holders to participate.

**Key Result 2.4:** Continuously monitor and maintain an average block time of less than 6.1 seconds while ensuring the proper functioning of validator nodes.

**Key Result 3.1:** Develop and implement a survey, designed by HR, to assess the satisfaction of DAO workers with governance and working conditions. Define the frequency at which this survey will be conducted.

**Key Result 3.2:** Enhance council voting participation to reach 15% of Joystream's total token supply. This will necessitate various measures, including improving incentives and outreach campaigns to encourage participation and reduce security risks.

**Key Result 3.3:** Aim to introduce two additional modules on Pioneer and an auxiliary dashboard to facilitate governance processes. Consider necessary changes in the bounty module before its inclusion in the runtime.
