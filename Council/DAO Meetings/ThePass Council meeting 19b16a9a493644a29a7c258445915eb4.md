- **Main topic**

ThePass has suggested that we apply for their free DAO aggregating platform and we have discussed what the platform entails the data we need to provide, and the potential benefits of being on the platform.

The representative from ThePass gave a tour of their website and gave a short background about their organization. Basically, anybody can list Joystream there [https://thepass.to/](https://thepass.to/)
 by clicking `List DAO`, and providing the info needed (nothing confidential needed).

NFT stats could be seen there (a killer feature they have compared to other DAO aggregators)

No fee/money needed from the DAO.

- **Next steps**

Involve ThePass representatives in checking if they support Substrate, Joystream DAO verifying the sign-up form requirements.
