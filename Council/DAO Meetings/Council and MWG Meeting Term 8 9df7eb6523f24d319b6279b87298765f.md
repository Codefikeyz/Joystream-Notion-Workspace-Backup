Marketing Plans

1. **Collaborations with another project** - MWG will be seeking for small exchange of mixing of audiences and they will introduce JS to their community and vice versa. Can give some joy allocation to distribute for retweets. Can also offer for them good quality content if we have video creators or content
- Kate has quite the capability to make good contents, everyone agreed but still need to hire someone particular to handle it.
- Also can do NFT projects, everybody seeking for marketing for mixing audiences, As per Robert, making collars are good. But in our case we do not have big twitter that could hinder callable to attract them (like additional offers content etc). Can contact and make a call and ask what they want
- Joy allocation is the best thing to offer as of the moment
- DAO can give joy to distribute for NFTs on gleev/l1media. Need to try various ways
- Collaborations are cost efficient
- This term, MWG will try to cover. Can make initial lists of projects that we can be contacted. The main idea is to collect a decent list like 50 projects. Need to start with something smaller - more realistic to have collab with them
- There seems to be no issues regarding collars, it’s always up to the collector. Joystream is a cool project and tweeting about Joystream won’t do any harm to any projects and conversions could be good
- During this term MWG will work with collabs project.
- Discussed about MWG workers, only 3 active workers right now. Will do opening today, hire 4 more guys. Need more researchers to execute more activities especially regarding collabs. MWG needs more hands and workers and can recruit from crew3 and from the community
- MWG lead is thinking about create a guide how to speak to the potential collaborators contacts and hire more workers and pay thru discretionary spending.

1. **Bitcointalk forum** - it is like a Pioneer Forum for Crypto enthusiast. Normally they launch an airdrop like crew 3 but all the activity are all done in the Forum - people setting their avatar related to their project. By the end, team will distribute tokens to the participants - Very huge Forum
- Already made/reserved the account name Joystream DAO account and will make a forum, rules for campaign, can design tasks, promote crew3, set a budget and start it.
- BTC talk requires more manual work, audience could be better from crew3,
- Rewarding system should be well-designed and this will require more manpower as the design template should be worked on
- Can do with only Joy, need to set a budget and compensation model form. Specify the USD value. Will do research and come up with the numbers.
- Will start with collabs and other campaign this term
- Smoothie award winning impact - JS Twitter - 300 new followers - more quality individuals - they saw in Smoothie and subscribes. More backlinks in [Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/). Not so much big impact but since its for free its all good. NFT has not been distributed yet

1. **Binance Live Ama** - great way for marketing. Need a person who has really the extensive knowledge of Joystream, a representative - like Bedeho, Tomato etc. who can join Ama with influencers
- Been trying to contact influencers and they only want USD (Pay them and tweet host in their Binance. Like 400usd )
- Will try to convince potential speaker for this

1. **Making video ads on YT** - Can create vids and join YT ads program and advertise for ex YPP, make video and ads using fiat USD and target specific categories of people (show this ads based on demographics and specific audience). Produced video for ads will be shown at the beginning of the video.
- Crypto niche will not be cheap.

1. **Preparing for databases** for YT channels, LBRTY platform having some troubles and will close soon. Priority to get the audience. Need GLeev app to be verified, can wait few weeks before doing so.
- Most popular channels - getting their contacts.

1. **Twitter hangouts** - same issue with Binance AMA, voice chat. Talking and sharing ideas and get hyped after Elons acquisition
- Might need funds, if we need big projects host the hangouts with JS

1. **Distributing content** - to increase backlink rates - we should increase the amount of backlinks leading to JS website to increase ranking in Google and Alexa
- Key words should be more generic “ media platform” “DAO” “video NFTs”, cause at least now “Joystream appears to be somehow on the top when searched on google
- For free distribution of content, there are not much, but MWG is already doing in Medium by crew3 participants. TO increase more, we need to approach webs like coin telegraph and coin desks which are expensive. Need to reach out smaller and make press release about YPP and JS. We offer this to website to be posted on their sites.
- Costs depends on the website. More views more expensive. Cointelegrapp charges thousands of dollars per article.
- Can distribute video content, gleev videos and can post on related forum threads.
- Distributing content could be a complex task since JS is a unique project as we already have working products which is much different than usual projects doing the distribution of contents
