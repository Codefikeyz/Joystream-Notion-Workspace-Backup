## Meeting Note

### Working Groups Tasks Update

**Assessment of Q1 OKRs**

- **KR-1.1 [Distributors]: Ensure median bandwidth > 20 Mbps and median TTFB < 350 ms for all deployment locations (across multiple tests).**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
    - **Notes:** This goal was achieved using synthetic data from ping locations in Q1. For Q2, we've integrated user data from Gleev, making measurement more challenging.
- **KR-1.2 [Storage]: Maintain percentage of lost objects 0%. Maintain percentage of unaccepted objects < 1%. Maintain a replication rate of no lower than 2 for all objects. Maintain an average node availability of 99.9%.**
    - **Status:** Partially achieved
    - **Notes:** We didn't measure lost objects and couldn't keep the percentage of unaccepted objects at 0%, hitting 1.8% and 1.9% due to a software bug, which is now fixed. Average availability of 99.9% and replication rate > 2 were maintained. Suggestion: Change "maintain node availability" to "maintain storage system availability 100%".
- **KR-2.1 [Council]: Average block time is less than 6.1s.**
    - **Status:** 100% achieved
- **KR-3.1 [Human Resources]: Conduct 2 anonymous surveys to understand whether DAO workers are satisfied with governance and working conditions.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
    - **Notes:** Surveys were conducted and analysis published on Pioneer.
- **KR-3.2 [Builders]: Pioneer Validator dashboard.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
- **KR-3.4 [Council]: DAO pay structure.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
    - **Notes:** Salaries moved from JOY to USDT, vested payments applied to leads' salaries, council salaries not reviewed.
- **KR-4.1 [Marketing]: Joystream is listed on at least 2 more CEXs. Achieve social media metrics required for exchange listing. Execute listing with DAO provided funds.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
- **KR-4.2 [Marketing]: At least 25 new Joystream-related review videos targeted at crypto audiences are posted on YouTube.**
    - **Status:** 100% completed
- **KR-4.3 [Marketing]: At least 3 new interviews with Joystream team are conducted and published.**
    - **Status:** 1 of 3 completed, remaining postponed due to a change in priority
- **KR-4.4 [Marketing]: Reach 32,000 non-empty channels and 1,400,000 non-spam videos on Joystream by the end of Q1.**
    - **Status:** Not achieved
    - **Notes:** To measure progress, compare beginning and end of Q2 metrics.
- **KR-4.5 [Marketing]: Onboard 10 Marketing Ambassadors.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED
- **KR-4.7 [Human Resources]: Organize at least 3 community events or workshops aimed at/for content creators during the quarter, with total views of event recordings not fewer than 500 views across all platforms for all videos.**
    - **Status:** Partially achieved
    - **Notes:** Rebranded to Creator’s Roundtable, did not complete 3 events but met total views threshold.
- **KR-4.8 [Marketing]: Achieve a 20% increase in total social media impressions compared to the previous quarter.**
    - **Status:** Needs a toolset to track marketing activity progress.
