Duration: 1h 53m

Notes by @tomato 

Review of Miro OKR document

- 10 JIP proposals in a quarter is seen as unrealistic, reduced to 2
- Discussion of presentation of OKRs and Objectives
- Are the content/channel growth OKRs realistic?
- Discussion of who will be responsible for measuring each OKR
    - Outcome: Table can be made which identifies the report cycle for each OKR and whether it can be assigned to a WG
- Run through of every OKR item and discussion of what each means and its value
- 0x2bc added many notes on the Miro page—many OKRs were refined slightly and some removed
- Outcome of meeting was that a table should be made to clarify OKRs and explain measurement cycles, who will do the measuring and how they can be impacted by the DAO (i.e. through assigning tasks to WGs)
