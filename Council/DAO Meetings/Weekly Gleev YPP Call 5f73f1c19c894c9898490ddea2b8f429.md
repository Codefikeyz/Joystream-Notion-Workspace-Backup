## Meeting Note

### CWG Progress and Discussion Points

**Status Update on CWG Tasks:**

- Creator Engagement Issues: Design epic completed, pending updates to the sharing model and addition of sharing button on the token page.
- Reward Page and Landing Page Design: Completed and ready for implementation. However, analysis suggests a bottleneck in signups predominantly through bronze channels. Manipulating rewards upward hasn’t significantly impacted signups on higher-tier channels. Proposed solution: Revise landing page messaging to highlight various earning avenues and include relevant statistics. Task assigned to JSG.

**Feedback on Creator Token:**

- Issues with filters and sorting on the all tokens table noted. An issue has been raised by bedeho to address this.

**Other Discussed Topics:**

- Focus Area: Debate on whether to prioritize improving Creator Revenue Tokens (CRTs) or focus on refining the Your Personal Platform (YPP), onboarding, and diversifying rewards with unique content.
    - Per Dimitri: Increasing revenue avenues could attract more creators. However, feedback from Ambassadors suggests a need for enhanced utility in CRTs. Proactive engagement with creators to gather data for improvement is recommended.
    - Per Leet_joy: Proposal for a public sale feature enabling creators to sell portions of their minted tokens at self-set prices.
    - Per Dimitrii: Suggested collecting data post-implementation of the dashboard and landing page to inform strategic decisions.

**Action Items:**

- Consider removing the maximum duration for revenue share, currently set at 30 days. Options discussed include complete removal, reduction, or enhancing warning signage for clarity.

**End of Session.**
