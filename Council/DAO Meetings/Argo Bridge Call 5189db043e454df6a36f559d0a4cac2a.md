### Meeting Notes

**Bridge Hosting:**

- Awaiting response from JSG to host the app.
- Alternative options are considered in case of no response.
- Concern about announcing the bridge address publicly before ensuring it is securely hosted.

**Token Listing & Usability:**

- The importance of getting the JOY token added to trusted token lists like Uniswap and Trust Wallet was highlighted.
- We discussed strategies to meet the requirements for these listings, such as providing detailed information and demonstrating the legitimacy of Joystream token.

**Audit Concerns:**

- Although a professional audit of the bridge hasn't been conducted due to budget constraints, the code has been reviewed internally by Mokhtar.
- The social risks, such as the potential for multisig signers to be compromised, are acknowledged as the main vulnerability.

**Launch Preparations:**

- We are working on setting up the Uniswap pool and considering how to manage the initial liquidity.
- How to properly list the new JOY token on CoinMarketCap, ensuring the total supply is accurately reflected when tokens are bridged to the Base chain.
