### **Discussion Points:**

    - **Question:** Why is Joystream not easily identified within its verticals (web3 social, video NFTs, creator tokens) despite its long presence?
    - **Action:** Assess and refine marketing strategies to improve Joystream's visibility and differentiation.
2. **Separation of Joystream and Gleev:**
    - **Observation:** The current presentation of Gleev is limiting Joystream’s reach, as it appears to compete directly with YouTube.
    - **Action:** Redefine Gleev’s presentation to highlight features that can be built on Joystream, emphasizing autonomy, independence, and unique monetization opportunities.
3. **Target Audience Identification:**
    - **Action:** Identify and segment the target audience for Joystream. Determine which aspects of Joystream should appeal to different audience segments.
4. **User Retention Strategies:**
    - **Action:** Develop strategies to keep users engaged on the Joystream website, enhancing the overall user experience.
5. **Collaboration and Partnerships:**
    - **Action:** Increase openness to cooperation and collaboration with other projects to enhance visibility and growth.
6. **Ambassador Program Review:**
    - **Observation:** Current ambassador content lacks organic engagement.
    - **Action:** Review and improve the ambassador program to create more authentic, story-driven content that resonates with viewers.
7. **Gleev Interface Improvement:**
    - **Observation:** The initial Gleev interface was not polished, potentially deterring creators.
    - **Action:** Enhance user experience on Gleev, including reintroducing categories on the left bar to improve navigation.
8. **Investor and Ecosystem Collaboration:**
    - **Action:** Foster closer collaboration with original investors and other web3 companies for mutual onboarding to Gleev.
    - **Ecosystem Integration:** Explore joining an existing ecosystem for greater visibility, such as using the Argo bridge to integrate with Polkadot as a wrapped asset.
9. **Diversifying Revenue Streams:**
    - **Observation:** Video platform and streaming can drive audience and views but need additional revenue sources.
