### Meeting Notes

### Key Discussion Points

- Concerns were raised about not being fully comfortable with Hummingbot and the potential risks of rushing deployment, particularly the financial risks associated with DeFi.
- We will continue testing and get comfortable with the setup before moving forward.
- JOY tokens need to be moved, and a pool needs to be created. Some app fixes are still in progress.
- Due to pending tasks and fund arrivals, the launch date is moved to at least a week later, tentatively aiming for Tuesday if all goes well.
- A proposal is needed to spend USDT from Ethereum mainnet safe and bridge it to ETH admin.
- The plan is to bridge Joy tokens today after a test transaction.
- All three council members need to approve transactions, which may delay the process.
- Test bridging back from ETH admin may take some time due to required signatures.
- Debate on whether to use ETH admin or Treasury Multisig for managing funds. ETH admin is responsible for managing the bridge and ERC-20 contracts, making it a natural choice.
- We will be using the Treasury multisig on Base for direct bridging and fund management.
- We agreed to create a Base multisig. The signers need to be available and preferably using hardware wallets for security.
- A review of the existing proposal to see if any governance changes are needed for the custody parameters or stablecoin management.
- Preference to first create the liquidity pool on a testnet to understand the process better. A script will be written to automate future pool creations.

### Action Items:

- Continue testing the setup and Hummingbot to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
- Initiate the transfer of Joy tokens and prepare the necessary proposals for fund movements.
- Set up the multisig on Base and ensure all signers are available and preferably using hardware wallets.
- Review and possibly amend existing governance proposals to accommodate the new Base multisig setup.
- **S**Create and approve a signal proposal for bridging funds if necessary.
- Review progress in the next meeting and adjust timelines as needed.
