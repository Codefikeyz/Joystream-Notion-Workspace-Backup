## Meeting Note

### Term 37 Highlights

- The Argo bridge has been launched but hasn't seen much use yet.
- No major fixes required as of now. Bridge monitoring is in place.
- The first round of cutting the council salary by half has been passed during this term.
- Ulyjoy has been officially delegated as the steward of the [joystream.org](http://joystream.org/) website.
- Collages has been appointed as the new Discord admin.
- Discussions on Q4 OKRs and roadmap were initiated, but no proposal was passed. This will be the responsibility of the incoming council.
- The Infra Lead has been onboarded successfully.
- The Content Marketing Manager (MWG) has started but results are under review. Further improvements in social media strategy are expected.
- The Apps Lead position was opened due to specific needs within the DAO.
- After communication with JSGenesis, it was agreed that more content work will be delegated to the apps working group to provide enhanced support to Gleev and gateway operators.
- Syncing issues with the YPP have been a concern. Channels are slow to sync, with a backlog of videos (~85 videos per channel in some cases).
- The storage node problems, as confirmed by Freakstatic, have been addressed but monitoring is ongoing.
- YPP Payments: Payments are being handled manually every Tuesday, but HubSpot access is needed for better tracking and reporting.
- A review of YPP expenses showed that video syncing and referrals take the most from the rewards account. Content creators have expressed frustration over delays in payment and syncing.
- Council members are encouraged to review the YPP modifications for a clearer strategy moving forward.
- Total spending for the term was about **4.2 million** including validator and working group expenses.
- The **council rewards** constitute 25% of the total issuance. A proposal has been submitted to cut council salaries in half.
- There was discussion about **burning JOY tokens** on L1, reducing issuance but with the possibility of tokens being minted again later.

### **Content and Ambassador Program**

- The **content manager** is working on strategy and social media but needs improvement in output. **Ambassadors** who submitted low-quality content have been removed, and the program is being refined for the next phase.
- The **Argo Bridge announcement** saw limited marketing efforts, but more paid marketing is in progress.
- Research on **media platforms in Russia** was conducted, and strategies to bring developers from these countries are under review.

### **Atlas Documentation & Infra Working Group**

- BWGL is working on **Atlas documentation**, and the onboarding process for new **operators** is in development.
- **Colossus S3 Support** is still pending due to the need for support from JSGenesis.

### **Roadmap and OKR Finalization**

- The roadmap for Q4 is under discussion, but resources for development are limited. Key items like progressive web apps, content recommendations, premium video commands API, and others might be deferred to Q1 2025.
- Council members are requested to provide input on which roadmap items can be handled by the DAO.

### **Recommendations for Next Term**

- Finalize roadmap and OKRs.
- Hire an Apps Lead to support Gleev and new operators.
- Ensure cost efficiency in the Infra working group.
- Adjust HR lead's commitment for expanded roles, including creator support and enhanced social media management.
- Submit another proposal to reduce council salaries by half.
- Continue supporting Joystream Community Building Fund efforts.
