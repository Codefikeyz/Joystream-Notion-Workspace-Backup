**Key Result 1.1: Distributors**

**Objective:** Ensure median bandwidth exceeds 20 Mbps and median TTFB is below 350 ms for all deployment locations through multiple tests.

- Increase geographic node coverage by hiring workers in South America and Africa. We have onboarded one new worker in South America but none in Africa.
- Enhance benchmarking process by reviewing code for accuracy, including factors like TTFB calculation, and deploy scripts for more locations for the ping tool (completed).
- Investigate Argus node selection by Orion and Atlas (resolved).
- Explore the usage of CloudFlare workers for improved bandwidth (preliminary investigation done, awaiting further action).
- Improve CPU usage of Argus node by integrating with a bespoke squid and optimizing state cleanup (pending Argus 2.0 release).
- Gather performance data from end-users of apps (e.g., Gleev) to assess perceived performance.

**Note:** Progress has been made on the ping tool data coverage but more data is needed for benchmarking. Consolidation and optimization efforts are currently prioritized.
