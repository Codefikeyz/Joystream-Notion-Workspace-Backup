### **Previous Council's Recommendations:**

- **JIP Process:** Bedeho has crafted an informative video explaining the JIP process. However, due to shifting priorities, the council is yet to finalize its decision.
- **Liquidity Provision Worker Hiring:** Leet_joy has been successfully onboarded as our liquidity provision worker. We're now in the process of finalizing the terms.

Talisman's response indicates potential staking integration in their next development cycle.
