- **Miscellaneous Expenses & Budget Planning:**
    - Discussion on the need for flexible budget planning due to market volatility.
    - Importance of setting a cap for yearly inflation to avoid financial issues.
    - Suggestion to establish agreements on project costs and long-term planning to prevent sudden cost-cutting.
    - Emphasis on collaboration with DAO members to align on budget expectations.
- **Liquidity Concerns & Market Impact:**
    - Acknowledgment of limited liquidity in the market affecting DAO's ability to increase costs.
    - Discussion on the impact of 28 days council term shift on long-term planning.
- **Proposal for Salary Cliffs:**
    - Idea to implement a six-month cliff for all salaries until early 2025 to reduce selling pressure on JOY tokens.
    - Assumption that the crypto market might recover by early 2025, but no certainty.
    - Concerns about the lack of liquidity and the potential benefits of reducing immediate token sales by DAO members.
- **Vesting & Salary Distribution:**
    - Discussion on current linear vesting and the potential issues with introducing cliffs.
    - Suggestion to combine a cliff with existing vesting schedules (e.g., six-month cliff plus one-year vesting).
    - Some members prefer longer vesting periods over reduced salaries, seeing it as a way to increase platform ownership.
- **Review of Salary Vesting Options:**
    - Agreement on the potential benefits of longer vesting horizons as mandatory, especially given current token value.
    - Discussion on removing the option of fully liquid tokens due to the potential for cashing out.
    - Acknowledgment of the upcoming end of token distribution to founding members by December, which should reduce selling pressure.
- **Twitter Spaces & Community Engagement:**
    - Highlighted the potential of using Twitter Spaces as a tool for community growth and engagement.
    - Success stories of communities growing rapidly through regular participation in Twitter Spaces.
    - Emphasis on the importance of regularity and consistency in hosting Twitter Spaces.
    - Suggestions to join other Twitter Spaces to increase visibility and engagement with the broader community.
    - Proposal to replicate successful strategies from other communities to grow Joystream's presence on Twitter.
    - Agreement on the potential benefits of using Twitter Spaces more actively to discuss updates, showcase projects, and onboard new users.
