**Discussion:**

CanaDAO has approached Joystream with an integration request, and our primary focus in this meeting is to delineate the scope of their requirements. To efficiently address this, we aim to identify the resources involved and determine the incentive structure for their usage of our CDN.

Regarding charging for CDN usage, there's a proposed approach of refraining from immediate charges. The reasoning includes the absence of authentication, allowing anyone to use it without restriction. Additionally, this phase is viewed as an experimental period for learning and development purposes.

Tomato has been assigned as the point person for coordination in the first meeting with Cana DAO's representative. Leet_Joy and Klaudiusz will also be in attendance to ensure a comprehensive understanding of CanaDAO's needs.

A crucial aspect to consider is the nature of the content CanaDAO intends to use on our platform. By gaining clarity on this, we can better align our resources and support to meet their specific requirements.

This meeting serves as a pivotal step in establishing a productive collaboration with CanaDAO, and we look forward to fruitful developments.
