### Meeting Notes

### New Key Results for MWG

1. **Increase in New Users and Creators**
    - Goal: MWG campaigns will drive a minimum of 20% new users and 10% new creators to Joystream apps on average.
    - Feedback: The key result should focus on specific numbers instead of percentages, particularly targeting creators.
2. **Targeted Developer Marketing Campaign**
    - Goal: Launch a marketing campaign to attract developers to build on Joystream, aiming for the launch of at least one new app by the end of the quarter.
    - Considerations: Address the need for technical and financial support for developers. Note the current limitation of not having an SDK for Atlas, which may result in apps resembling Gleev.

### Discussion Points

- **Handover Calls**
    - Proposal: Conduct handover calls via Twitter Space
