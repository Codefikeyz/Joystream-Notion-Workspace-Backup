## Questions

- from User @Murloc shaman#2889

1. When YPP will available for l1media?As I know, for now it's available only for gleev, but our content isn't crypto related.

Ans by Jen: No date on it's availablity right now, but it is being worked on by the team.

Ans by LeetJoy: We do not only have YPP as a reward program, we also have other programs that rewards good content like CRP and Channel payouts for good contents.

2. Can users sell their own video NFTs on other popular NFT markets in the future?

Ans by LeetJoy: When Joystream has a legal adoption and a large community of users, we are certain some other market places will support us, also some plans of having our own marketplace will be in the works by now.

3.  Did you think of early users or OG Discord roles?

It was discussed but nothing specific yet, we will deploy Discord tipping bot soon to reward active users with good contribution right on Discord.

4. I can't understand how the views on the platform are working right now. For example Joystream AMA video. It has 9 likes and 2 views. How this can be? Is it counts views for only full watching till the end or it's the bug?

Ans by Freakstatic: it's normal right now as we don't have much users yet on L1media, it also operates with different statistics from gleev.

5. Did you think of streams? I think many of content creators would use streamer function.

Ans by Jen: Same question was raised, Bedeho said that it is possible but we are quite far away from that in terms of dev

++ No further questions 

---

- On Yasir’s initiative to contact workers for DWG and SWG:

Leet_Joy: interesting topic regarding scaling our infrastructure working groups and will be happy to hear from Yassir. We are having much awareness soon and with listing and other activities, our creators count will start growing significantly as contents will be uploaded too, so we should get ready for any urgent increase in Storages and distributors and would like to know if there's any plan or expected integration or something we can use if we have a spike in uploaded content. We'd like to see a draft of plan, such as if X size of content is uploaded in one term, then we need to hire X amount of new storage workers and maybe configuration for the servers, so we will have a better idea.

++ No audible content from Yassir: discussion to be continued in Forum.
