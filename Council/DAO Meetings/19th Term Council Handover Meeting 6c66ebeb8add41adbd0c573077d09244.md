- Research on listing opportunities on South Korean exchanges like Upbit, Bithumb, and GOPAX has been conducted.
- Work is underway to popularize the YPP v2 referral program.

**CWG:**

**3. Recommendations and Plans:**

- Consider adjusting DAO salaries to reflect the significant increase in JOY token price and rebalance spending across different working groups.

**4. Plans:**

**5. Discussion:**

- **DAO Treasury:** Council has selected the treasury multisig signers, but two signers have not provided Ethereum wallet addresses. Proposal 522 aims to fill the DAO treasury, and clarification of the transaction process is needed.

- **Q4 OKR:** Analyze Q3 OKRs, which faced challenges due to shifting priorities. Enhance Joystream as a video sharing protocol. Assign working groups to each initiative for detailed planning.
