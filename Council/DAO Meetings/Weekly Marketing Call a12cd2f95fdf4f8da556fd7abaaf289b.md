### Key Discussion Points

**Ambassador Program Updates:**

- **Goal:** A revamp of the Ambassador Program is planned, with an announcement targeted for release this week. Key adjustments aim to enhance the program's appeal and improve ease of participation.
- **Incentive Overhaul:** The current system, which requires ambassadors to grind for XP, will be revised to make it easier for both new and existing ambassadors to earn rewards. This includes a more streamlined workflow and enhanced incentive offerings.
- **New Initiatives:**
    - **Bounties:** Ambassadors will be given specific bounties and content creation tasks to guide their contributions.
    - **Content Plan:** A structured content plan will be rolled out, outlining the type of content ambassadors are expected to create. This should improve content consistency and alignment with Joystream's broader marketing strategy.
    - **Squads:** Ambassadors will be organized into squads to foster collaboration and encourage leadership within the program. Some of the most active ambassadors will be identified as potential squad leaders.
    - **XP Rewards:** Additional XP points will be granted for high-quality, prominent contributions from ambassadors, aimed at driving more impactful content creation.

**Coordination with the HR Working Group:**

- There will be coordination between the HR and Marketing Working Groups to handle inquiries related to the Ambassador Program. With the anticipated rise in applicants from new promotional efforts, clear communication channels and support will be essential.

**Promotional Campaign for Q4:**

- **Target Communities:** The program will be promoted in various communities to drive higher participation. The expectation is to see an increase in the number of applicants compared to the previous quarter.
- **Applicant Goals:**
    - Q3: 450 applicants
    - Q4 Goal: 1,000 applicants
- The focus will be on recruiting video content creators to scale up the program.

**Current Progress:**

- Marketing WG is progressing with efforts to roll out the next phase of the Ambassador Program. Work includes refining the new structure, aligning with the content plan, and ensuring readiness for the program's announcement.
- **Upcoming Milestones:** The next steps will involve promoting the updated program and managing the increased influx of applicants.
