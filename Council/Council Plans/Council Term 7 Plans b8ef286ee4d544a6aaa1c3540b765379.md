## 3**. Analysis of Previous Council's Report**

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. We have received valuable recommendations from the past Council.
2. While drafting the plan, YT-synch has already been accomplished, causing a slight shift in priorities. 
3. The data from the report has been verified and is accurate.
4. The key takeaways appear to hold significant value and warrant further analysis to understand how the Council can enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.
5. The previous Council's performance seems satisfactory, but there is still scope for enhancement. The current Council has identified certain key objectives that are deemed crucial for the term, supported by Key Initiatives to steer the DAO in the right direction. Key results are also outlined to evaluate the achievement of objectives by the term's end.

## 4**. Objectives and Key Results**

The Council considers these objectives the most important ones for this term and is supported by Key Initiatives to guide the DAO on what courses of action to take. Key results are also identified to help assess whether the objectives are met or not by the end of the term.
