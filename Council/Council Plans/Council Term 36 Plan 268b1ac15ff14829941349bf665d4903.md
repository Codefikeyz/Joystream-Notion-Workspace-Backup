- Dates: August 1, 2024 → August 29, 2024
- Council Term: 36
- Start block: 8,625,631
- End block:  9,028,830

## 1. Composition

- l1dev, 25%
- leet_joy, 23%
- 0x2bc, 18%

Election results: [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/election/past-elections/00000010](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/election/past-elections/00000010)

## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- **0x2bc**: Continue working on Q3 OKRs.
- **0x2bc**: Prepare and roll out the Argo Bridge into production.
- **0x2bc**: Adjust salary allocation per worker from 650 USDT to 550 USDT for SWG, as the council now covers server costs in USDT.
- **0x2bc**: Approve the EMA30 cap (0.01) at the beginning of the term.
- **0x2bc**: Ensure Weekly Twitter meetings are held consistently. Consider hiring a dedicated Twitter manager. Additionally, create a public Marketing events calendar to ensure full DAO synchronization across BWG, CWG, and MWG.
- **0x2bc**: Besides hiring a dedicated Twitter manager, consider hiring a Content Manager. Even a costly Content Manager can be beneficial in terms of ROI (salary less than impact on the market cap).
- **0x2bc**: Follow up on Discretionary Spendings: Labeling System. For more details, visit [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960).
- **0x2bc**: Omit the Weekly Roundup section in the General Stats section of the Council report as it is not necessary.
- **0x2bc**: Revisit the idea of creating comprehensive quarterly or semi-annual reports.
- **0x2bc**: Prioritize future developments carefully, as resources are limited. Ensure that current priority developments contribute significantly to PMF rather than being "nice to have."
- **leet_joy**: submit an WL application for Aerodrome DEX listing as secondary exchange for wrapped JOY on BASE
- **leet_joy**: facilitate launch of AMM on Uniswap for wrapped JOY on BASE and ensure not less than 10K USDT were used at srart
- **leet_joy**: hire MrBovo for developing arbitrage strategy for Hummingbot (BASE <> MEXC)
- **leet_joy**: support content wg with delivering partners section on Gleev
- **leet_joy**: recommend builders to focus on SDK

## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

- The council report is good, though it's getting longer and harder to read.
- We can skip the weekly report table and just include a link to it, or only keep links to the most recent reports. There's no need to have the whole history of weekly reports in the council plan.
- Overall, the previous council had a productive term.
