## **2. Council Priorities and Working Group Tasks**

- **WG leads transition and filling roles in the DAO** - With the resignation of two leads (CWG and DWG), coordination is needed to fill these roles and formally release the resigning leads from their positions.
- **OKR & Roadmap Update for Q4** - By the end of this council term, it will be Q4. A meeting should be held to decide on the objectives for Q4 and appoint someone to ensure that fixes are made and that the Roadmap is updated on or before the start of the next term.
- **Argo Bridge Launch** - Ensure a smooth launch with coordinated efforts between working groups.
- **YPP modifications** - Partner with the Content Working Group to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current YPP reward system and implement any necessary improvements.
- Provide **support to the Marketing Working Group** by assisting with additional tasks and initiatives, as well as helping to fill any necessary vacancies within this term.
- Address **Gleev matters** by clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the DAO and JSG following the Content Lead’s resignation. This is essential for ensuring better coordination and collaboration related to the app.
- **Merge the infra groups**. Try to find and onboard an Infra Lead who will take care of the 2 working groups - Distribution and Storage for optimal and cost-effective operations.

*Note: The council has reviewed the* [*Kanban Board*](https://www.notion.so/416293a342d645c8a402caf00c5be69c?pvs=21) *with all the suggested council tasks and considered the previous council's recommendations from the* [*Council Term 36 Report*](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/961?post=6983) *(see section no. 8). The above items will be prioritized for this term, if there will be room for more, the council may reconsider other tasks.*

**Council's Feedback for Term 36 Report**

- The report is satisfactory. The lowest EMA-30 cap was recorded last term, and despite that, the spending turned out to be reasonable.
- Even without an approved plan for the past term, the council successfully maintained a productive term.

### Storage WG

- Maintain a replication rate of not lower 2 for all objects.
- Maintain percentage of unaccepted objects < 2%.
- Maintain percentage of lost objects 0%.
