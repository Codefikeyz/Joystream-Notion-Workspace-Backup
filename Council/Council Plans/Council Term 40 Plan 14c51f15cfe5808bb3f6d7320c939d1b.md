## **2. Council Priorities and Working Group Tasks**

**YouTube Partner Program (YPP) Re-enablement**

- Creator Compensation Resolution: Validate budget allocation for missed creator payments (October-November period), which includes reviewing and authorizing back-payments for zero-duration video issue, ensuring weekly video limit rules are properly applied in compensation calculations. Execute payments.
- Monitor storage cost implications of increased sync volume and completion of sync queue processing (~80k remaining videos).
- Review and approve automatic tier reinstatement for previously opted-out creators, review channel tier storage limits before YPP re-opening.
- Authorize re-enablement of YPP sign-ups (estimated timeline: December 3)
- Coordinate with MWG on YPP relaunch communication and leverage improved content sync capabilities for platform promotion. Launch email campaign to re-engage opted-out creators while supporting current successful initiatives (e.g., CoinMarketCap visibility).
- Re-evaluate YPP program rewards structure, including sign-up bonuses, referral payments, and sync rewards across all tiers (Bronze to Diamond) to ensure program sustainability and attractiveness for creators while maintaining healthy DAO spending.

**CDN Optimization**

- Work with the infrastructure lead on optimizing the content delivery costs
- Investigate and optimize storage by identifying and removing superfluous content from the library, with a particular focus on duplicate video files, videos with exceptionally high storage consumption, and content from channels that have been terminated or no longer meet platform requirements - ensuring efficient resource utilization and reduced storage costs for the DAO

**BASE ecosystem** 

- Continue active discussions with Aerodrome team for potential listing
- Review current $JOY-USDC pool parameters based on market conditions & consider allocating additional liquidity if metrics show positive growth
- Execute checks for bridge signers availability and implement automated alerts for bridge operations
- Engage with BASE ecosystem projects for potential collaborations & participate in BASE ecosystem Twitter Spaces and community events

**Operational Tasks**
