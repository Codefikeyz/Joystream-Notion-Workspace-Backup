## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. The past term report was delayed due to mistakes with the numbers
2. The handover session was played a crucial role in addressing the issues mentioned in the report.
3. Some of the WG tasks in “Task Status” are outdated, like BWG “calamar explorer update” or “discord role bot” which were rejected by the council
