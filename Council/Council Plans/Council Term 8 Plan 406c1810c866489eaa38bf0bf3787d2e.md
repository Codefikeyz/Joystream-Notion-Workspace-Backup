## 2**. Previous Council's Recommendations**

- Review approved Q2 OKRs and OKR Process, suggest improvements, help working group leads in integrating the OKR system, and help leads with creating group-wise OKRs with measurable Key Results.
- Playback issue - contribute to the development of automatic systems to monitor/test the delivery of content to the user.
- Finalize approval of Ephesus Upgrade (if there are no problems with the upgrade). Make sure the leads are aware of deadlines and actions that need to be prioritized ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175?post=346](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175?post=346)).
- Review the proposed SWG/DWG salary formula ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327))
- Work out the hackathon plan and budget, and finalize the hackathon tasks ([https://github.com/traumschule/community-repo/tree/events/events](https://github.com/traumschule/community-repo/tree/events/events)).
- The HR group seems to be spending too much. We need to check the activity of the group. Maybe we should not pay 3 workers for welcome messages in the welcome channel. Newbies don't see these welcome messages until they are verified. Does this make sense?
- Look for a community speaker that can attend Binance AMA and Twitter hangouts.
- Conduct Handover/Retro session first time ([see proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/197)).

## 3**. Analysis of Previous Council's Report**

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. Actually, the report is very clear, considering that it was created from scratch by a completely new council, which is very impressive. Great work!
2. We have received valuable recommendations from the past Council. The handover session assisted in clarifying any unresolved issues.
3. In the report, I couldn't find any mention of the listing topic in the report, even though it is a very high-priority issue.
4. A minor comment: the report only contains positive information about WG performance; however, we know there is still room for improvement. The Recommendations section provides more insight into what can be improved, but this should also be highlighted in the Working Groups paragraph as well.

## 4**. Objectives and Key Results**

The Council considers these objectives the most important ones for this term and is supported by Key Initiatives to guide the DAO on what courses of action to take. Key results are also identified to help assess whether the objectives are met or not by the end of the term.
