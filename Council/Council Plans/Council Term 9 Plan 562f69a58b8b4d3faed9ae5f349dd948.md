## 2**. Previous Council's Recommendations**

- Continue work on OKRs and guide the leads in doing their termly set of Objectives, Key Results, and Initiative and use the OKR template added on the wg plans [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/242](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/242)
- Supervise the efforts on the creation of Monitoring Tools in SWG and DWG
- Continue the discussion on DWG and SWG Salaries and come up with an approved [formula](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327) for both ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327))
- As the final approval for Validator Increase ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/252](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/252)) is due this term, the council must discuss the **Validator Increase Post-Mortem (**[https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/234](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/234)**) and identify&solve the issues in Validators**
- Make sure the leads have an alternative form of communication with their workers in case of work emergencies, especially in SWG and DWG. And also with our Validators.
- Create a discussion and do a study about the major change in constitutionality  (from 4-2) What are the risks? Pros and cons etc
- With the Ephesus upgrade fully implemented and in effect, HR should create training/orientation for the community on the basic changes and new features brought by the upgrade.
- See to it that HR engagement plans and activities are running in Discord such as games, quizzes, and others - perhaps start brainstorming for a new one, this time, it should target participation from the newcomers. Training session about Signal Proposal in a form of a video must be produced and facilitated by HRWG
- Activities in telegram should be taken into account as well - HRWG needs promote activities there
- Like the Validators Increase, MWG should have a Post-Mortem posted in Forum for the result of the 2nd sprint of Crew3/Zealy Campaign
- Supervise MWG for the 3rd sprint of Zealy Campaign - design the tasks by identifying the target audiences and expected outcomes. Launch other efforts on BItcointalk and other platforms
- in the next report, please look at the gen stats about the channel count

3. We have received valuable recommendations from the past Council. The handover session assisted in clarifying any unresolved issues.

5. A new DWG lead was hired.
