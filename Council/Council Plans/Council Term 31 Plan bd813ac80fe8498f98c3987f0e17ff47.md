## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- Internal Ops Issues
    - Kick off OKRs planning for Q2
    - Grading/report for Q1 OKRs
    - Finalise question of council composition and payment
    - Revamp of some areas of Council’s notion page (tomato will assist with this, but needs some coordination with council to not be disruptive)
- Roadmap
    - Meet and discuss Q2 roadmap (this requires JSG to be present). It has already been scheduled for Wednesday, 27th March.
- Budgeting and Financial
    - Conduct a review of the budget increment amount (it was adjusted recently, but with vested payments a new review is required)
    - Conduct a review of validator rewards / validator count, the total amount staked has jumped recently which means the amount paid to validators/nominators has increased.
    - Progress with Giants Web3 agency for treasury and financial services
    - Streamline process of financial reporting in council reports
    - Get council report generator looked at because inflation projection is incorrect and appears to just be a sum of all council terms since mainnet launch—it also doesn’t calculate inflation from the current issuance.
    - Need a better way of dealing with leads paying themselves with vesting schedule, during this term 3 leads didn’t pay themselves within the actual term which created a shortfall of spending that resulted in temporarily lower inflation and will result in temporarily increased inflation in the next term (as leads will be paid twice in the same term). Council must ensure WG leads action payments within the term (excepting some emergency situation) otherwise it creates huge confusion with accounting and inflation projections.
- Funding
    - Ensure sufficient budget is present for YPP ops (~ 20k USD per month) and plan for DAO takeover of YPP payments
    - CWG creators engagement support budgeting
- WG
    - BWG: Confirm composition of the BWG team in context of Sygma and Luxor
    - CWG: Support CWG with setting up YPP payouts
    - All WGLs to have Kanban boards. Tech can do Github. Non-tech do in Notion.
- Nara upgrade for Atlas
    - Work with Dmitry, Builders and JSG to decide on rollout date for new Atlas features. JSG is waiting for an answer on this.
- Other
    - Proposals needed:
        - WGs budgets refill
        - Minting YPP funds
        - Minting Creator Engagement funds
        - SAFE transfer to Giants
        - SAFE transfer to Leet_joy to pay for JD posting and Segment
        - Funding proposal for Robert
        - Verified Organization on X
        - Add socials buttons on Gleev app (follow JoystreamDAO X within YPP sign-up flow, etc)

## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

- The Council Task section in the term report and plan is not aligned. Some items were not on the plan but are on the report. It would have been better if there were more info on each progress of the tasks with the relevant links attached.
- The council report as whole was well written.
