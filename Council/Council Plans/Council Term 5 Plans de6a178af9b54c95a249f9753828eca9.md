## 3**. Analysis of Previous Council's Report**

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. The expenses in the previous 4th term were reduced compared to what we had in the 3rd term, as no extra payments or bonuses were made.
2. The format of the Council report should be revised based on the evidence indicating that changes need to be made (Work status paragraph should be removed, list of current WG Lead should be added, etc) 
3. The summary does not include a detailed explanation of the council's strategy, the reasoning behind why the council chose to prioritize certain tasks over others, and the challenges it faced during its term (for reference see [Report for 3rd Term](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/52?post=515))

## 4**. Objectives and Key Results**

**OKRs that should be addressed within this term's scope.** 

As the council period progresses, Council Members have come up with these several objectives below. The Council considers these objectives the most important ones for this term and is supported by Key Initiatives to guide the DAO on what courses of action to take. Key results are also identified to help assess whether the objectives are met or not by the end of the term.
