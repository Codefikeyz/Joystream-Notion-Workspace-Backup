- Council Term: 32
- Start block: 7,012,830
- End block: 7,416,030

## 1. Composition

- Jenny, 21%
- 0x2bc, 20%

Election results: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/election/past-elections/0000000w](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/election/past-elections/0000000v)

## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- Jenny: Review the OKR thread and pass a proposal for the Q2 OKRs within the 1st week of the term
- Jenny: Review lead salaries and tasks suggested by the working group leads in the plan ensure they align the council duration. Despite the general increase in salaries with vested payments and given that the council term shifted to 28 days, the progress in tasks seemed to have not matched the duration of the council term, nothing significant improvement compared to that of 15-day council term period. This is also advisable since the market is not doing so well currently
- Jenny: Consider requiring all the DAO workers to write their daily updates, might be a good way to understand work being done and how efficient a working group is. Not necessary for SWG DWG
- Jenny: Provide necessary support to CWG for the CRT Release and YPP payments takeover from JSG
- Jenny: Review/assess Q1 2024 OKRs
- Dmitry: Consider offering role of council sec to Tomato (DM)
- Dmitry: Continue working on the Finance Spreadsheet - finalize WG individual sheets for aggregation of council plans and work with Giants on Dashboard tabs (DM)
- Vikan: Consider hiring an external marketing agency to promote the Creator token, the MWG is doing a great job but we are limited to the web3 space and we need to reach the creators outside the web3 space and I think the CRT is too big for the experimental marketing we’ve been doing, we could hire an agency for a month and reassess their results and the MWG could build off of their results

## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

The council report is comprehensive, covering key statistics, highlights, working group progress, budgets, and financial details in a transparent manner. It effectively utilizes tables and charts to present data clearly, and includes valuable recommendations from council members for the next term.

Comment: 

- Payment for CEPH clustering work in the amount of 5250 USDT is expected to be made via the USDT Treasury. This is not included in the table above.
- BWG workers should be paid for the actual hours worked, so the entire BWG budget for this term won't be used
