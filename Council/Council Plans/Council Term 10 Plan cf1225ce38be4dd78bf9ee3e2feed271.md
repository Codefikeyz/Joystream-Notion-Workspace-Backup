## 3**. Analysis of Previous Council's Report**

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. The report looks really good - we really impressed. 
2. The data provided is correct.
3. In the Summary section, some information can be clarified in greater detail: I couldn't find any mentions of why the spending for Term 9 was 1,431,831 JOY, while the actual spending for Terms 9 was 1,839,119 JOY. Furthermore, it is essential to bring attention to the Compensation Plan Proposal, which was a noteworthy occurrence - it proposed to spend an impressive 2 million USD in JOY and was almost approved.
4. The handover session was really helpful in clarifying mentioned issues.
