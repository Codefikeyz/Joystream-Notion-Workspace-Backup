## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- Work on reducing SWG spending by having the replication factor only to two
- Discuss and vote on the “Budget Increment Proposal” within 5 days of being elected, as it will expire after that time period ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/760](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/760))
- Discuss the various consolidation and WG decisions (such as pausing the apps WG, and possibly consolidating Forum + Membership WGs into HR)
- Conduct a review and solicit feedback from people working from the DAO about the EMA-30 pricing tool ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/818](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/818))
- Conduct a review of the way validator rewards are presented in Council plans and reports ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/819](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/819))
- Follow up on and asses the impact of the recently enacted liquidity injection into Joystream markets ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/755](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/755))
- Perform an assessment of DAO WGs—although the HR WG seems to be the most discussed WG in this respect it may be worth reviewing all working groups.
- Discuss the DAO Resources Allocation topic ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/809](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/809))
- Discuss whether it is worth delaying `nara` runtime upgrade to consider doing a validator reward curve adjustment ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/810](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/810))
- Discuss the pre-proposal regarding the builder WG lead’s salary ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/794](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/794))
- Discuss the pre-proposal regarding “Tomato Compensation Discussion” ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/800](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/800))
- Consider assigning a set of trusted community members to engage in OTC deal negotiation as it appears that the people trying to negotiate with the DAO are uncomfortable doing this publicly (there is no current forum thread for this)
