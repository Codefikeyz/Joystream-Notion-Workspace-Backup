## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

- The council report is good, though it's getting longer and harder to read.
- We can skip the weekly report table and just include a link to it, or only keep links to the most recent reports. There's no need to have the whole history of weekly reports in the council plan.
- Overall, the previous council had a productive term.
