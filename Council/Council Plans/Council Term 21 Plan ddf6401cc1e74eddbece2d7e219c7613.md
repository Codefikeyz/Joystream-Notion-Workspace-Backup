## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- Research Tokenomics (calculate token burn)
- Continue implementing EMA30 pricing into budgets and plans
    - All WG/Council plan/report budget section should include USD valuations along with JOY amount
- Fill stablecoin treasury
- SWG/DWG/BWG should prioritize solving atlas playback issue
- Create reward system for MWG/HR/CWG
- Shut down Apps WG
- Come up with a document or a guide for Safety Work Policies and/or perhaps work on JoystreamDAO Guidebook

## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

- Before the introduction of automated data fetching for reporting, it should be checked in detail to ensure all data is correct.
- Membership WG must make report/plans for council overall budgeting
- Some tasks are duplicated in HR and MWG and sometimes the two leads are not aware of this duplication

## 4. Objectives and Key Results

### Council tasks

- Refill stablecoin treasury by `100,000 USDT`
- Finalize DAO budgeting/salary system for remaining WGs and require all WG and council to include USD valuations into budgeting
- Finalize AWG plans for the future
