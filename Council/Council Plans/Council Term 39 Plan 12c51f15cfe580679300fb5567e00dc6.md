**Council's Feedback for Term 38 Report**

- The report is satisfactory. The lowest EMA30 was recorded last term, and despite that, the spending turned out to be very reasonable.
- The council successfully maintained a productive term.

### Storage WG

- Maintain a replication rate of not lower 2 for all objects
- Maintain percentage of unaccepted objects < 2%
- Maintain percentage of lost objects 0%
- Maintain a storage system availability of 100%

Additional:

- Deploy an archive node and sync library
- Replication rate reduction to 3

### Distribution WG

- Monitoring
- Migrate @Deathix node to a cheaper server to reduce costs

### Builders WG

- Archive script: Finish the [archive script](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/5193) and coordinate the execution of it. This should allow us to reduce storage replication rate for actively served objects and save costs.
- YPP issues: Investigate the persisting YPP issues like [this one](https://github.com/Joystream/youtube-synch/issues/337).
- Fix the status of creators that have been opted-out by mistake and find a solution that would allow us to sync new videos in time again. If not possible - support shutting down or
significantly cutting down the YPP program from the development side.
- Atlas CRT listing issues: Fix CRT listing issues in Atlas like [this](https://github.com/Joystream/gleev/issues/61) or [this](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6437) one.
- Continue maintaining [Joystream technical issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGxo8ranpirLSjWFbLh-rmqgaU0Q9wGGN8oox4D5q1c/edit?gid=0#gid=0) spreadsheet and try to arrange it into a more structured plan for the future.

Additional:

- Development of Tips in Atlas https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6291
- Start work on Infrastructure authentication

### HR WG
