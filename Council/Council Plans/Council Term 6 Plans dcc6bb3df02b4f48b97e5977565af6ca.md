- Conduct the training: How to effectively write Proposals
- Recommendation from the 4th Term is still actual: “Distributors didn’t submit a report yet but the lead planned to provide a salary formula for distributors, the current council should consider the salaries of distributors according to the formula if the council accepts the formula.”

## 3**. Analysis of Previous Council's Report**

The only slight change from the 5th to 6th term of the Council meant that almost the same people were working on both documents. Although it can be difficult to remain objective when providing feedback on one's own work, we did our best to ensure our feedback was fair and unbiased.

From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:

1. This is the first Council Report for the 5th term created using the revised template [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/157](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/157). Few more adjustments were made compared to what the template stated. The WG Spending table has been enhanced to show the initial budget of each WG. Moreover, the terminology used to describe the general statistics has been adjusted to promote better understanding of the data provided. The rest of the template appears satisfactory.
2. The data from the report has been verified and is accurate.
3. Key takeaways seem to be of particular significance, so they should be analyzed further to gain insight into how the Council can be made more effective and efficient.
4. Overall the performance of the previous Council appears to be satisfactory, though there is always room for improvement. 

## 4**. Objectives and Key Results**

**OKRs that should be addressed within this term's scope.** 

As the council period progresses, Council Members have come up with these several objectives below. The Council considers these objectives the most important ones for this term and is supported by Key Initiatives to guide the DAO on what courses of action to take. Key results are also identified to help assess whether the objectives are met or not by the end of the term.
