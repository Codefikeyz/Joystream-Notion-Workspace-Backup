[Report](../Council%20Reports/Mainnet%2012th%20term%2088bd23e8c462452f91a94ae5b89af55a.md)

## 1. Composition

- [0x2bc](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/election/past-elections/12?candidate=0000001s), 22%
- [leet_joy](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/election/past-elections/12?candidate=0000001v), 18%

→ [election result](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/election/past-elections/0000000c)

## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- Review WG budgets and salaries to get a clearer picture on needs once JOY is liquid.
- Prepare new Q3 DAO OKR
- Promote staking and validating to increase network security.
- Content working group should start shipping channel payouts. Generate better documentation which channels we are rewarding that can be used for marketing with examples of HQ content.
- Provide necessary resources to MWG to increase Joy listing awareness. Initiate additional marketing activities such as AMAs.
- BWG and AWG need to focus on setting up development teams and take part in above discussion about priorities and support the [origo release](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/4766). The [CR has many suggestions](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues) to improve ecosystem tools that should be reviewed and added to the roadmap.
- We need mobile apps! Or one excellent one. The (new) apps lead needs to stay updated on development of the different apps and know and in which ways users (want to) use Joystream and can use the budget to make things happen.
- Development of own block explorer and mobile version of Pioneer.
- Contribute DAO Gateway roadmap, initiate necessary discussions.
- Create a document that showcases our CDN in comparison to the [competition](https://jetpack.com/blog/video-hosting-cost/): Develop price metrics for storage and distribution and cooperate with marketing for insights.
- Discuss possibilities of YPP implementation to other apps.
- Council needs a tool to automate accounting and stats (again).
    
    ### **@0x2bc' feedback**
    
    From the Term Report of the previous council, we can draw several conclusions and they are as follows:
    
    1. The report looks ok. 
    2. The handover session was really helpful in clarifying mentioned issues
    3. The data provided has quite a bit of typo. (1) Budget numbers seems not to be correct (2) Commas and dots are mixed within the table (3) Grand total JOY spent doesn’t equal the number provided in the inflation section 
    4. The summary of the previous term only included successful work, which is great, but it would be even more helpful to provide data for why some of the suggested items weren't implemented, as well as explain why the mid-term session was skipped. Let's be as objective as possible and post both the positives and other items.
    5. Some clarifications should be added to the Summary section - there are some ty-pos in the report. For WGs, Total spending (planned), JOY **-** 1 081 675,4. Total spending (actual), JOY **-** 678 489,3. 

## 4. Objectives and Key Results

Based on following [OKR](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/216) breakdown WG leads are assigned specific term tasks to address themselves or delegate to workers.
