Guests: @spat_sochi 

Duration: 80 minutes

## Topics Discussed

- Discussed methods of improving the Lead bonuses system
    - some parameters in Content and Forum WGs cannot be checked
    - it is necessary to automate the verification
    - for indicators for which it is impossible to conduct a full check, it is necessary to conduct a random check until a better solution is found
    - now the calculation of bonuses is objective, therefore, at this stage it makes no sense to make bonuses part of the main Lead rewards
    - it is necessary to write guides on how to count Lead bonuses in each WG, due to the turnover of Councils
    - needs to add the response parameter in HR Lead bonuses
