## Forum

**Lead:** @secret_girl 
**Deputy:** @songoku
**CM Liaison: @LepsA** 

- WG is paused, does not perform any tasks.
1. Forum Moderation: Can't do since no one has access at the moment.
2. Forum Training: Can't do as well because of access matter also.
3. For Lead/Deputy: We will just update Mainnet Roadmap and  some notion pages (if applicable)!!!
- However, it is planned
1. will create new categories and subtopics from scratch.
2. will work on hiring additional forum interns as we plan to build a pool of trained forum workers for future drafts.
3. Tasks are still relevant.
