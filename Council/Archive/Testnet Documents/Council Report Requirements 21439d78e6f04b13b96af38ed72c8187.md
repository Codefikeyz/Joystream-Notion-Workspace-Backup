## Motivation

- Allow Jsgenesis to update the [Council Period Parameters](https://www.notion.so/testnet-workspace/testnet/testnet-rewards#council-period-parameters) and [network-performance-score](https://www.notion.so/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring#network-performance-score) metrics for the next period based on up to date and accurate information.
- Allow the possible next council to have good information about the most urgent matters and status of the network.

## Scope

- Accounting of how much was spent on what.
- Actual hires made.
- Actual firings done.
- Spending proposals passed.
- Changes made to the notion board.
- A summary on how well the network as a whole performed, and what problems occurred.
- Recommendations for what should be focused on in next council period in order to make the network more effective.
- Feedback on the Council Period Parameters during their term.

## Submission

The report itself must be written as a markdown document in English, in the forum category `Testnet>Council>Summaries` , as a thread which has the title which includes the council period ID. The council must pass a text proposal (add link when proposal list is in) which references the report on the forum.

If there is a need to link to extra information, statistics, etc. these should be in the notion board.
