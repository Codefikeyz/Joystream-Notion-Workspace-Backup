# Lead Bonuses v2

Rewards are designed to motivate leaders to do a more effective work. This should increase the groups' scores.

### Rules

- Bonuses are for group leaders. Group leaders must request their rewards through the Funding Request Proposal after being judged by the councils.
If the leader indicated extra hours in the summary, but does not request a reward, councils can create the proposal themselves.
- Counsils can change the rewards for each score in each group based on the current priorities in the groups.
- *If you have a catastrophic error, you have bonuses canceled for the period.
- If a [group's score](../Lead%20Bonuses/WG%20Scores%20from%20the%20%D0%A1ouncil%20a0c7a76e4e7d4fecb40cf827621cdb94.md) drops below 0.5 for 3 consecutive periods and steadily decreases, the council cuts the leader's current salary in half.
- If the leader of the group gets 2 catastrophic errors in a row, the council cuts the leader's current salary in half.
- If the leader of the group gets 3 catastrophic errors in a row, the council starts looking for his replacement.
