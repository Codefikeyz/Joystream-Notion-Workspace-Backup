# Topics discussed

## Spending numbers

- Council has spent around 74% of the budget
- Council rewards were wrong but they will get reimbursed

## Your take on previous council

- Some council members were still very inactive
- There were some confusion about the deadlines and that summary and report are different documents. It’s necessary to update the rules document based by the council on the previous terms.

## Update/status of council communication

- Were done 6 council stand-ups, one more to sync with council members about the deadline changes presented on the [Council Period Scoring](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring#summary-report-and-plan-deadlines) document.

## Update/status of Council <> WG/Lead communication

- On the previous term the council tried to be more opened about the plan and goals by posting in each working group discord channel.
- Bigger terms are necessary to improve the feedback loop between the council members and the leads.

## How did it ref changing the responsible party for plans and summaries?

- The council kept the working group assignment to one of the council members, since there was some inactive council members this didn’t worked as well as it should.
- @Kirillmagicpie was assigned to create the proposal to submit the plans/summaries

## Thoughts on what deadlines needs to be?

- Deadlines values are ok but they create some confusion since the summaries and reports will be submitted after a new council is elected.

## Onboard of the new council member

- Quick summary of that it’s the normal workflow of the council term
