# Conclusions

## Problems related width budget of DP or SP

- Relation between tJOY/JOY will stay the same per council term and is not affected by how it was gained (so for example a validator earned tJOY has the same amount of value that tJOY earned by a SP).
- Is expected for SP & DP WG to take some lost (the other WGs invest time, this one's will invest $ with hardware costs since they don’t spend much time working after setup the servers)
tJOY will not be important to keep people in mainnet so rewards in JOY are “preferred”.
- It’s really important to have some SPs always up, since they can be required for DP to cache content, but SP could/should be selected to have a good amount of storage but low performance (since the DP will do the content distribution to atlas) to reduce the costs on the budget.

## WG Scores

- They will be public
- Score in the future should be measure by the CMs (but still to be decided but this will be important to mainnet)
- @freakstatic mention @l1dev WG OKRs but it seems that they conflict with WG scores

## Forum Categories Limitations

- It could have some technical limitations but there is a possibility for it to be increase in the next runtime upgrade

## Bounties Bugs

- It still has some bugs to make them easy to use for the oracle but they should be fine for “normal user” usage.

## Problems with Marketing JOY attribution

- Still no WG Score for this group so it makes doesn’t make much sense to include them in the budget.
- Measures still have to be defined for this group make JOY because it’s hard to define good short-time measures.

# Notes

- Next calls should be shorter and have an agenda to keep it more organised.
- Council deadlines need to be better define since the current ones don’t seem to be working well (~~the council is failing various of deadlines~~)
