# Information about the previous term

- Marketing lead doesn’t want to hire more people to the group
- Some leads still have to define their work responsibilities
- Grading is still really late
- There are 3 new workers in the forum WG
- The Lead bonuses system is ready

# Update/status of council communication

- Only 3 active CMs
- No problems with the lead communication

# Recommendations for the next council

- Forum hired 2 more workers so they will need
    - an increase of budget
    - make sure that a deputy is hired
- Try to check the summaries and reports of the previous term and report is anything is missing not done properly
- Keep the work on the working group lead bonuses
    - Include in the plan or in a separated proposal what will be the bonus for this term
- It would be great to change the deadlines for submitting WG reports. If the Leads submit reports at the end of the deadline, then the Consuls do not have time to enter information into Council Summary
    - change the deadlines for submitting WG report or
    - finalize the Summary, including more necessary information for the Consuls' report.
