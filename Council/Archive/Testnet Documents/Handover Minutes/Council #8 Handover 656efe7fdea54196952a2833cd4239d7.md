## **Update/status of Council <> WG/Lead communication**

- The council has been following the curators, special the lead, to help her improve scoring.
- Motivated storage provider lead to create an opening for new newcomers and for a deputy, it was done the same for distributors but still no results.
- Discussion about assigning a council member to a lead, advantages and disadvantages

## **Some planned scoring metric changes**

- Discussion about good and bad aspects of a smaller council, with only 3 members.
    - Good: Better rewards per council member, more focus and better candidates.
    - Bad: A lot of work per candidate
- The council/working group can suggest changes to the scores.

## Suggestions for new term

- Last council increased the council budget increments so now it’s possible to Increase the working group budgets more. Some values were suggested
- SP & DP should explore the logs of the elasticsearch built-in
