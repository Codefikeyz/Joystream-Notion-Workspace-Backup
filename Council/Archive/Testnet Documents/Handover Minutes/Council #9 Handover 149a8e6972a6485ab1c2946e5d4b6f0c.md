Partcipants: @Martin @Kirillmagicpie @IgreX @freakstatic

# Topics discussed

## Spending numbers

- The council has used a good percentage of the budget

## Your take on previous council

- Only 3 members of the council participated actively
    - may be a good idea to avoid having other roles besides being council member
- Follow up of the curator lead gave results but still a lot of work to be done
- Storage group had high rewards, with subsidies this should be a lot lower

## Update/status of council communication

- Council standup calls were very helpful to assign the tasks and make the other council members aware of what they can do

## Update/status of Council <> WG/Lead communication

- The council submitted a document with some rules to define the deadline for the summary report of the working groups to Friday 23:59 CET to make it clear the deadline what they need to follow.

## Some planned scoring metric changes

TBD…

## How did it ref changing the responsible party for plans and summaries?

The active council members participated more in the plan and summary, some tasks were assigned during standup calls. 

## Thoughts on what deadlines needs to be?

To allow a better planing at least 2 days or even more, if the council term is increased to 2 weeks. This would allow for some feedback from the council about the working group plan to be take into consideration.

## Discussion about bounties

Question about target audience of the bounties right now

- HR creates bounties for newcomers with JOY allocation

The council could fund bounties but they will not get JOY allocation without Jsgenesis consent. The council could also fund “bounties” using funding requests.
