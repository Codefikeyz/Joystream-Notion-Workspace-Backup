# Council #7 Handover

- **Spending** on groups last term: 38M, [Report](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/103)
- Better **announcement of changes to [Gitbook](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring#council-period-summary)** but there is a new [Changelog](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/changelog) one can [monitor commits](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/commits/master)
- **How many SP/DP host their own QN**? few for SWG, some more in DWG (can be tested live [here](https://olympia.joystreamstats.live/storage)). it’s more important for Distribution to host their own in case JSG QN goes down (still relies on atlas which uses JSG one)
- Council should announce cm **WG liaisons** to leads like [council did last term](../../../Council%20Reports/Olympia%206%20f34fc608f59b42b0b29014255bd6a144.md)
- Council can create **spending proposals** for specific (council) or other extra work (like secretary), leads can hire deputy
- Council should provide **Markdown templates** for forum reports to leads
- **Runtime Tests**: deploy separate **staging instance for Builders** and council to test => scored via RESEARCH
- **Grading tools /spreadsheets** are shared on Tuesday. [Workflow](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/projects/1)
- How often should leads change (**Lead Opportunities**)? JSG will provide example
- Low **Forum Weight** intentional? Yes but will change.
- Forum lead is isonar's partner - conflict of interest? Positive because easier communication.
- Suggestion for more language specific communities.

**Recommendations** for the next council term from [](../../../Council%20Reports/Olympia%206%20f34fc608f59b42b0b29014255bd6a144.md) 

- The council approved Lead Bonuses and suggest to adjust lead rewards accordingly.
- Improve descriptions of WG openings, not just links from notion and handbook.
- Encourage leads to prefer newcomers / non-FM for hiring and suggest more bounties.
- The Council should have one or more calls with the leads during the term to ensure focus.
