Rewards are designed to motivate leaders to do a more effective work. This should increase the groups' scores.

### Rules

- Bonuses are for group leaders. Group leaders must request their rewards through the Funding Request Proposal in next term after being judged by the outgoing council.
- Council can change the rewards for each score in each group based on the current priorities in the groups through signal proposal.
- Council can add new scores or eliminate previous scores depending on priorities through signal proposal.
- If a group's score drops below 0.5 for 3 consecutive periods and steadily decreases, the council cuts the leader's current salary in half for one term.
- Around 44% of leads salary will be paid to WGs leads via lead bonuses.
