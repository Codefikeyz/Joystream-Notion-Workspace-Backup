# How to Calculate WG Scores

`WG Score = Total amount / Max reward`

### Example:

In Builders WG the maximum bonus reward of the group leader is 16k JOY.

After reviewing the points of the group counted the sum of 10k tJOY bonuses for Builders WG leader.

So Builders WG Score = 10000/16000=0.76

**Builders WG Score = 0.62**
