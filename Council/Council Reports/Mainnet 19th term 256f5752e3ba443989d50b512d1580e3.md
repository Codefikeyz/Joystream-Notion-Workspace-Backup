## 7. Recommendations for Next Council

- Research Tokenomics (calculate token burn)
    - It is recommended that a policy or agreement is reached for an upper inflation bound as this can inform what the budgets should be for other WGs
- Continue implementing EMA30 pricing into budgets and plans
    - An approval for this proposal was passed at the beginning of last term but should be more fully implemented and monitored as this will be the first term when it is in actual use
- Fill stablecoin treasury
- Finalize DAO budgeting/salary system
- SWG/DWG budget/salary and worker requirement
    - To date there is no approved compensation scheme for either WG which is leading to confusion
- MWG should prioritize exchange listing and ambassador program
- Test lead scoring system from HR
- Shut down Apps WG
    - During the last term there was one person on Discord who showed interest in signing up for the Apps WG to run a gateway/app but it is unclear how this progressed.
- Come up with a document or a guide for Safety Work Policies and/or perhaps work on JoystreamDAO Guidebook
- Review and implement Q4 OKRs; assess Q3 OKRs
- Ensure the timely delivery of the Weekly Summary
