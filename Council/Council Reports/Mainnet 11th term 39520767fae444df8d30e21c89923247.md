## 2**.** Summary

The Council made progress on organizing resources like templates and processes based on Signal proposals with a new [Notion database](../Archive/Proposals%20(archived)/Proposals%2097fd07b6db8d4ff39aa8a15ea501f865.md). Also the [Community repo refresh was discussed](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/76?post=3758) with goal to create a new community owned public resource to grow the community:  [New PR with a first summary](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/pull/896) to support (new) CM to get an overview and make better decisions.

We exerted considerable work and dedication to address the [Development Priorities Q2](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/403) to improve processes and focus. The [pre-proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/category/8) section of the Pioneer forum got a cleanup, with inactive threads being moved to the [archive](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/category/56) and several new pre-proposals were introduced and discussed:

[Block Explorer Contest](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/399) received a lot of feedback which will inform a better bounty program for the next term.

[**Handover Meeting Flow](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/331)** signal proposal was approved in order to improve calls.

Due to prolonged inactivity the [Apps wg lead was slashed](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/329) and [replaced](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/334).

**Marketing Updates**

AMA outside Joystream held on 30.06 and got decent [awareness](Mainnet%2011th%20term%2039520767fae444df8d30e21c89923247.md).

Notable growth of followers on DAO and JSG Twitter (more than 2000 growth on each).

Zealy 4th sprint was launched and [announced](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/status/1660558682097168387).

Joystream Galxe profile was verified and MWG [launched](https://galxe.com/joystream/campaign/GCsPXUNDo2) and [announced](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/status/1664625070017265665) first campaign.

Link3 Joystream DAO [profile](https://link3.to/joystreamdao) was verified.

[DAO Gateway Logo Contest](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1107018375445631107) extended for 2 weeks.

DAO Stablecoins Treasury [discussions](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/409) were initiated in order to introduce new way how the dao can integrate stablecoins in its operations.

To reduce the risk of fraudulent activity the council made the decision to create a new [#Scam-Awareness channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1114112686666555406) which is already in place thanks to JSG.

## 7. Council Daily Reports

In this period, "daily reports" were posted on discord [and the forum](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/390) every few days.

## 8. Recommendations for Next Council

- Review WG budgets and salaries to get a clearer picture on needs once JOY is liquid.
- Prepare new Q3 DAO OKR
- Promote staking and validating to increase network security.
- Content working group should start shipping channel payouts. Generate better documentation which channels we are rewarding that can be used for marketing with examples of HQ content.
- Provide necessary resources to MWG to increase Joy listing awareness. Initiate additional marketing activities such as AMAs.
- BWG and AWG need to focus on setting up development teams and take part in above discussion about priorities and support the [origo release](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/4766). The [CR has many suggestions](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues) to improve ecosystem tools that should be reviewed and added to the roadmap.
- We need mobile apps! Or one excellent one. The (new) apps lead needs to stay updated on development of the different apps and know and in which ways users (want to) use Joystream and can use the budget to make things happen.
- Development of own block explorer and mobile version of Pioneer.
- Contribute DAO Gateway roadmap, initiate necessary discussions.
- Create a document that showcases our CDN in comparison to the [competition](https://jetpack.com/blog/video-hosting-cost/): Develop price metrics for storage and distribution and cooperate with marketing for insights.
- Discuss possibilities of YPP implementation to other apps.
- Council needs a tool to automate accounting and stats (again).
