## 3**. Term Highlights**

- This term implemented the [chief council experiment](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/972), where all three winning candidates in the election adhered to the agreed-upon structure. In this scheme, the candidate with the most votes or the [Chief CM](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/980) decided on proposals, while the other two council members aligned their votes accordingly.
- The [Argo Bridge](https://bridge.joystream.org/) was fully launched.
- A fireside chat was held on X Space (formerly Twitter Spaces).
- Working with the HR Lead, the council successfully onboarded our first [Infrastructure Lead](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/1005) and a Content Manager for the Marketing Working Group.
- The council passed the first round of [approval](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/1006) to reduce council salaries by half.
- The council [appointed](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/982) a DAO member as an official steward of joystream.org and a [new Discord admin](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/983).
- Discussions were initiated regarding [Q4 OKRs](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/979) and the [Roadmap Update for Q4](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/984).
- Four leadership positions were opened, including a new opening for an [Apps Lead](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/openings/apps-13). Two of these positions were filled: the Infrastructure Lead and Content Manager roles.
- At the end of the term, the pending YPP Rewards payments were settled, and the YPP syncing issue was resolved by JSG.
- Implementing the [EMA30 cap at 0.015](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/965) was also done this term, resulting in a significant decrease in DAO-wide spending and the lowest token issuance since Term 31.

**Challenges**

- The absence of leads in two working groups impacted operations:
    1. The lack of a CWG lead and the inability to hire one affected YPP Operations, particularly the planned YPP review and modifications.
    2. The vacancy in the DWG Lead position required significant time and effort from the council to find replacements.
- The sudden resignation announcement of the SWG lead at the beginning of the term forced the council to refocus on finding an Infrastructure Lead instead of managing both working groups (SWG+DWG).
- The overall market conditions made it difficult for the MWG to execute certain activities related to the Argo Bridge Launch and to fill roles within the DAO. Additionally, the sentiment from the community in the communication channels was not particularly positive.
- Issues surrounding YPP caused discontent among creators. While two major issues were resolved, one remains and is currently being addressed by the Infrastructure Lead and JSG.

## 4**. Tasks Status**

- 🟢 **WG leads transition and filling roles in the DAO** - With the resignation of two leads (CWG and DWG), coordination is needed to fill these roles and formally release the resigning leads from their positions.
    - *Council’s remark: After deliberation, the council decided to shift focus from hiring a CWG lead to recruiting an Apps Lead, viewing this as a more strategic move. The opening for the Apps WG lead position was approved and is currently active. Regarding the DWG lead vacancy, the council opted to onboard an Infrastructure Lead instead. This position has since been successfully filled.*
- 🟡  **OKR & Roadmap Update for Q4** - By the end of this council term, it will be Q4. A meeting should be held to decide on the objectives for Q4 and appoint someone to ensure that fixes are made and that the Roadmap is updated on or before the start of the next term.
    - *Council’s remark: Threads were created in the Forum to discuss OKRs and the Roadmap Update. However, by the end of the term, neither the OKRs nor the Roadmap Update had been approved. These items will be carried forward to the next term for finalization.*
- 🟡 **Argo Bridge Launch** - Ensure a smooth launch with coordinated efforts between working groups.
    - *Council’s remark: The Argo Bridge is fully operational and launched. Marketing initiatives related to this development are ongoing.*
- 🟡 **YPP modifications** - Partner with the Content Working Group to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current YPP reward system and implement any necessary improvements.
    - *Council’s remark: Progress on YPP modifications was limited in Term 37. The complexity of the program requires careful consideration of numerous factors. As an interim measure, the council opened a new lead position for the APPS Working Group. The council believes that a dedicated team or individual should work on this alongside DAO-wide goals. It's proposed that the APPS WG should handle Gleev-related matters, as it's an app built on Joystream, while the Content WG should focus primarily on video curation across apps. This decision aims to provide specialized support for app development and operations within the Joystream ecosystem, with YPP management being one of several key responsibilities for the APPS WG lead.*
- 🟢 Provide **support to the Marketing Working Group** by assisting with additional tasks and initiatives, as well as helping to fill any necessary vacancies within this term.
    - *Council’s remark: Working with HR, the council successfully supported the MWG lead in hiring a Content Manager.*
- 🟢 Address **Gleev matters** by clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the DAO and JSG following the Content Lead’s resignation. This is essential for ensuring better coordination and collaboration related to the app.
    - *Council’s remark: The APPS WG lead position was opened to provide enhanced support for Gleev's development and overall direction, ensuring alignment with the DAO's objectives.*
- 🟢 **Merge the infra groups**. Try to find and onboard an Infra Lead who will care for the 2 working groups - Distribution and Storage for optimal and cost-effective operations.
    - *Council’s remark: Freakstatic was hired as Infrastructure Lead mid-term. The handover for the DWG side has been completed, while the transition for the SWG side is ongoing.*

Notes:

- For a full breakdown of each working group's expenses, refer to Section 5. Each working group's status includes a link to the lead's report.
- The column titled `Spending (actual), JOY` represents the actual amounts spent by each working group, primarily on salaries. For the Marketing WG, this also covers various initiatives. The `Workers rewards, JOY` column shows the amount of JOY paid to workers per block. Currently, most DAO workers are paid through discretionary spending, which is not reflected in the table.
- This term, the DWG has not executed salary payments. This is because the lead is new and occupied with other responsibilities, as they also lead the Storage Working Group.
- The Content WG appears to have no spending because the working group lacks a lead, who is the only one capable of paying workers from the WG budget. As a workaround, workers were paid through a series of funding proposals.
- Most salaries in the working groups are USD-denominated and subject to vesting schedules (determined at the beginning of each term) and an EMA30 limit, which was implemented this term. Consequently, the salaries do not reflect the current token price as they are affected by the EMA30 cap and vesting.

## 8**.  Recommendations for the Next Council**

1. Finalize Roadmap Update and OKRs
2. Atlas documentation/guide must be finalized in the next council term.
3. Hire APPS lead to provide enhanced support to Gleev and to potential gateway operators. Work with the development team in creating an onboarding process for the operators/dev/app owner.
4. Cost-efficiency in the infra working groups
5. Submit the council salary reduction again and pass the 1st round of approval
6. Creator support must be transferred to HR, and the council should consider adjusting the commitment rate of the HRWG lead for the additional tasks (ex. creator support and enhanced social media support as MWG onboarded a content manager). Following the resignation of the  creator support Richard
7. Stop JCBF
