## 8**.  Recommendations for the Next Council**

- **0x2bc**: Continue working on Q3 OKRs.
- **0x2bc**: Prepare and roll out the Argo Bridge into production.
- **0x2bc**: Adjust salary allocation per worker from 650 USDT to 550 USDT for SWG, as the council now covers server costs in USDT.
- **0x2bc**: Approve the EMA30 cap (0.01) at the beginning of the term.
- **0x2bc**: Ensure Weekly Twitter meetings are held consistently. Consider hiring a dedicated Twitter manager. Additionally, create a public Marketing events calendar to ensure full DAO synchronization across BWG, CWG, and MWG.
- **0x2bc**: Besides hiring a dedicated Twitter manager, consider hiring a Content Manager. Even a costly Content Manager can be beneficial in terms of ROI (salary less than impact on the market cap).
- **0x2bc**: Follow up on Discretionary Spendings: Labeling System. For more details, visit [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960).
- **0x2bc**: Omit the Weekly Roundup section in the General Stats section of the Council report as it is not necessary.
- **0x2bc**: Revisit the idea of creating comprehensive quarterly or semi-annual reports.
- **0x2bc**: Prioritize future developments carefully, as resources are limited. Ensure that current priority developments contribute significantly to PMF rather than being "nice to have."
- **leet_joy**: submit an WL application for Aerodrome DEX listing as secondary exchange for wrapped JOY on BASE
- **leet_joy**: facilitate launch of AMM on Uniswap for wrapped JOY on BASE and ensure not less than 10K USDT were used at srart
- **leet_joy**: hire MrBovo for developing arbitrage strategy for Hummingbot (BASE <> MEXC)
- **leet_joy**: support content wg with delivering partners section on Gleev
- **leet_joy**: recommend builders to focus on SDK
