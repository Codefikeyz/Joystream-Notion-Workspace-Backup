## 7. Council Daily Reports

In this period, "daily reports" were posted on the discord every few days.

Here is the link for the reports: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/332](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/332)

## 8. Recommendations for Next Council

- Continue work on OKRs and guide the leads in doing their termly set of Objectives, Key Results, and Initiative and use the OKR template added on the wg plans [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/242](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/242)
- Supervise the efforts on the creation of Monitoring Tools in SWG and DWG
- Continue the discussion on DWG and SWG Salaries and come up with an approved [formula](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327) for both ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327))
- As the final approval for Validator Increase ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/252](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/252)) is due this term, the council must discuss the **Validator Increase Post-Mortem (**[https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/234](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/234)**) and identify&solve the issues in Validators**
- Make sure the leads have an alternative form of communication with their workers in case of work emergencies, especially in SWG and DWG. And also with our Validators.
- Create a discussion and do a study about the major change in constitutionality  (from 4-2) What are the risks? Pros and cons etc
- With the Ephesus upgrade fully implemented and in effect, HR should create training/orientation for the community on the basic changes and new features brought by the upgrade.
- See to it that HR engagement plans and activities are running in Discord such as games, quizzes, and others - perhaps start brainstorming for a new one, this time, it should target participation from the newcomers. Training session about Signal Proposal in a form of a video must be produced and facilitated by HRWG
- Activities in telegram should be taken into account as well - HRWG needs promote activities there
- Like the Validators Increase, MWG should have a Post-Mortem posted in Forum for the result of the 2nd sprint of Crew3/Zealy Campaign
- Supervise MWG for the 3rd sprint of Zealy Campaign - design the tasks by identifying the target audiences and expected outcomes. Launch other efforts on BItcointalk and other platforms
- in the next report, please look at the gen stats about the channel count
