# Mainnet 3rd term

Date: January 17, 2023 → February 1, 2023
Council Term: 3
Council Terms: 3 (https://www.notion.so/3-0d885190e3c14f048ed8361ea840513f?pvs=21)
Testnet / Mainnet: Mainnet

# Summary

Despite the substantial scope amount, everything went relatively well. 

We accomplished a great deal, the main one being the establishment of the DAO's basic setup, which included the setup of major WGs, the implementation of necessary governance procedures, and the addressing of other urgent questions. 

In light of the fact that certain Working Groups have been engaged in their duties for approximately one month, at the close of 2022, without any rewards for their services, the previous (testnet) Councils have committed to providing compensation for all of their work performed. In the current term, the Council achieved consensus on the [plan for pre-mainnet WG contributions’ reward](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/103) and allocated the initial distribution to the BWG with other WGs to be paid off at the next step.

As for the topics that didn’t go really smoothly, it is worth mentioning the OKR development. It would take another week to properly address this topic, as it necessitates substantial effort and collaboration between the different parties involved. Unfortunately, during our term, the Council dealt with numerous concurrent activities which have limited our capacity to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to the OKR.

The most crucial topics to be addressed in the upcoming Council term should be the finalization of the OKR system, the development of long-term strategies for the Working Groups, and the assessment of the proposals to increase the “validator set number”. 

<aside>
ℹ️ Regarding the “validator set number”, the proposal type for this action (change of validator set number) requires a constitutionality of 3 which means it must be voted on by 3 successive councils for it to be actioned by the DAO. Kindly do not overlook and cast your vote on the mentioned proposal(s)! More discussion on the topic [is available here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/35?post=173).

# Financial Statistics

**I. Chart 1
Council Term 3 Actual WGs Spending**

**Shown in the chart are the percentage of actual costs consumed by each working group from the total amount of the incurred spending for WGs.**

![Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 6.51.15 AM.png](Mainnet%203rd%20term/Screen_Shot_2023-02-03_at_6.51.15_AM.png)

- *This term, two working groups have been added to the set up - Human Resource WG and Content. Although, BWG still remains the top group when it comes to actual spending followed by SWG and MWG. More info on Table II.*

II. **Chart 2**

**Council Term Overall Spending (debt payoff excluded)**

**Shown below is how the total spending is being distributed among these accounts below.** 

![Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 9.36.17 AM.png](Mainnet%203rd%20term/Screen_Shot_2023-02-03_at_9.36.17_AM.png)

- *From the chart, it is seen that WG expenses is the highest, followed by Validator’s Rewards, Council Rewards and Funding Proposals. In this term, there were only two Funding Proposals - both of them requested by BWG (one is for a [payment](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/94) of a worker who is not officially hired and the other as the [bonus](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/96) of the lead.) More info on Table I under the Budget for the Term’s section.*

**III. Chart 3**

**Comparison between Term 2&3’s Actual Spending among the WGs**

- It can be seen here that there has been a significant increase on some of the WGs spending particularly with BWG having 300% increase for a just a term. Next is MWG and APPS….. More info can be found on Table II and in the report of Council 2 [here](Mainnet%202nd%20term%20ecc31522264b41e6ad9862600421595c.md).
