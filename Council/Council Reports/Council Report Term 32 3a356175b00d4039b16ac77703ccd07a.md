As for the charts: 

- **Chart 7.5. WGs’ spending for current term, JOY**
- **Chart 7.6. WGs’ spending for current term, USDT**

We left out these charts because the data from WG reports is incomplete or missing, making the charts misleading. We chose to skip them for now, but we can add them later once the WG reports are updated and complete.

## 8**.  Recommendations for the Next Council**

- Jenny: Implement Q2 OKRS and ensure that working group tasks for the term are aligned with it.
- Jenny: With the Membership Lead’s resignation, ensure that the tasks are transferred accordingly. Take note of the additional tasks of the HR lead and if necessary adjust the involvement and salary according to the overall tasks of the lead. Make sure the faucet is well monitored and always has sufficient balance.
- Jenny: Inform the leads again about the DAO vacation policy and make sure everyone has the same and right understanding of the Policy
- Jenny: Follow up on Tangem and ensure that all the necessary DAO support upon launch is provided.
- Jenny: Revisit Creator Engagement Program of CWG and ensure smooth launch. Recheck the rewards and see if the are aligned with the other initiatives we have (e.g. *Ambassador Program*)
- Jenny: Upon the approval of the council term plan, make sure that all the leads read it and have their working groups plan be integrated with the council’s.
- Jenny: Ensure that necessary support is given to BWG’s bridge work.
- Make a decision where to bridge (ETH or BASE).
- 0x2bc: Ensure WG leads submit reports on time and as per Council format. Term 32 report was delayed due to late or incomplete WG reports. This must not recur.
- 0x2bc: CWG payments were not made within the term boundaries. Fix this next time.
- 0x2bc: The reporting tool lacks info on WG budget refills via extrinsics. BWG should address this.
- 0x2bc: Follow up on giants' work.
- 0x2bc: Follow up on the Gleev Google search issue.
- 0x2bc: Review Table 6.3. of Council Report. Consider removing or transforming it, as the current format is not effective.
