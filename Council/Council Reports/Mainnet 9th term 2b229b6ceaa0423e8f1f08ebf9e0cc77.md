- Review JOY tip bot built during term 9. Add the bot to the Discord server.
- A close look into HR budget and outcome.
- Conduct a meeting with the newly hired App working group. Start work on the roadmap, scope of work, and OKRs for App working group.
- Contribute to the block explorer roadmap and make sure that incentives are good enough to find a person or a team to start actual development.

- Push forward initiatives relating to gateways, such as YPP policies for l1.media and also push forward the DAO-owned gateway concept.
- Supervise the efforts on the creation of Monitoring Tools in SWG and DWG.

- Conduct necessary research and consider validator increase proposal.
- With the Ephesus upgrade fully implemented and in effect, HR should create training/orientation for the community on the basic changes and new features brought by the upgrade.
- Training session about Signal Proposal in a form of a video must be produced and facilitated by HRWG.
- Increase quality of conversations in Telegram chat, guide HRWG in actual promoting on-chain activity and DAO opportunities.
