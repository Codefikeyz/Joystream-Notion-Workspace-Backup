## 2**. Summary**

The Council's term was relatively successful in terms of tasks performed, with no major hiccups, and the budget was allocated as planned (except for Crew3 payouts, which we had forgotten to include in the Council Plan for the 6th term, this payment was for an anticipated activity that we had known about for a long time). 

**Primary focus**

The focus for this term was primarily the items that are written in the OKR table represented in Table 3.1, however, in the latter part of the term, JSG brought to the attention of the council the issue of the Playback and the council put it in the main priorities right away and the priority has changed as shown below:

The DAO-wide priority in the order of urgency and importance were the following ones:

1. YT-synch

2. Playback improvement

3. OKRs and the rest of the tasks from the Council Plan for the 6th term

**Issues emerged**

- We have identified an issue with the playback feature, where the time response can be as high as 5 seconds, which is unacceptably long. In response to Bedeho's report, we have included this as a top priority in our roadmap. It is still unclear which part of the system is contributing most to the long response time, but the DWG Lead is working on this. By the end of the next term, we should have a better understanding of which part of the system needs to be improved first.
- We did not manage to complete the YT-synch tests as we had initially planned. On the 18th of March, we only managed to set up the testing environment. This included the configuration of five storage nodes, the proper installment of the YT-synch CLI for testing, and the creation of test scenarios. The original launch date for YT-synch was the 24th of February, but this had to be postponed multiple times due to various reasons; some of these were related to the JSG's ongoing development, and others were linked to problems with Pioneer and the YT-synch CLI. Everything now appears to be ready, and we expect to conclude the testing process within the next week or less.
- Some people in DWG received a too low salary in the previous month, according to the dashboard data provided by JSG. However, it seems that the dashboard information may be incorrect. Consequently, the question of recalculating salaries has arisen. Additionally, DWG Lead is attempting to devise a new formula that will account for the costs of DWG node runners.
- It has been noticed that the BWG workforce has dropped to a low level. There is an ongoing investigation to discover the source of this decline in activity. As a result, more people are being recruited and other precautionary measures are being taken to avoid a similar issue in the future.

**Takeaways**

- Usually development and testing can take much longer than anticipated. When setting deadlines, it is absolutely essential to be cautious. As we saw with the YT-synch project, even for seemingly straightforward tasks, we could miss the deadline by a full month.
- We should be on the lookout for more ideas that are relatively easy to implement, like the Crew3 marketing campaign, that could have a great impact on the project. Doing this will ensure that we are able to get the most out of our efforts, and that our project is a success. Let's search for more such ideas and make sure our project reaches its full potential!
- Staying organized and focused can be a challenge, especially when there are multiple tasks to complete -as we usually have in Council plans. To help make things more manageable, it is important to create a top three priority list for the term. Let’s stick to such approach. This will ensure that tasks are being prioritized in the most effective way possible, and will help keep us focused on the most important tasks.
- In order to ensure effective communication with leads, we need to implement a more structured approach. This includes a mandatory handover/retro meeting with the lead and council (already implemented), as well as a mid-term meeting to stay up to date with mid-term progress and feedback. Such meetings will enable us to keep track of our leads and ensure that our communication is clear and effective. By taking this proactive approach, we can ensure that our leads are well-informed and that our communication is always at its best.

## 3. **Tasks Status**

**Table 3.1. Termly OKRs**

| No. | **Objective** | **Key Results** | Initiatives | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Conduct YT-synch Testing** (Make sure infra is fully ready for the YPP launch) | The YT-synch tests were done in accordance with the predetermined testing methodology and the testing results were presented to JSG and Council. | (1) Set up a testing environment  (2) pre-agree testing scripts (3) Conduct tests (4) Provide results to JSG  (5) Make necessary adjustments to the Storage system (if any). For more info see the Pioneer discussion [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/180?post=777](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/180?post=777) | With the release of YPP functionality scheduled on the 20th of March, the team working on the testing is set to complete the testing before. [Test scenarios](https://www.notion.so/20bd23212e8945f09a6b958b8d79e1df?pvs=21) have been developed and the team is currently doing the testing  |
| 2 | **Ephesus Upgrade** (Ensure the DAO is running the most up-to-date and efficient software)   | The proposal for an upgrade to Ephesus has been decided on, and a plan detailing how to validate future Runtime upgrades has been created. [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175)  | (1) Ensure proposed changes meet business logic (2) Test logic implementation (3) Verify existing functionality works (4) Confirm no unintended changes from Runtime Upgrade | Further tests are being conducted with the joint effort from the JSG, BWG lead and DWG lead. More info found on the runtime upgrade [proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175) and on the [#ephesus-release](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1067037933573521429) channel on discord |
| 3 | **A plan for the hackathon is developed and approved by the council** | A clear plan consisting of hackathon topics (+ deliverables where necessary), schedule, budget/prizes, rules, management personnel of the hackathon, WG involvement, judges, submission process, and all key parts are delivered. | (1)The hackathon plan has been developed and approved, and (2) the Council, MWG, and BWG teams are working together to get ready for the Hackathon. | BWG, MWG, and the council are still having a [discussion](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/295?post=1373) about Hackathon. BWG and MWG are evidently occupied with many things this term working so delays are expected with Hackathon and it is understandable.  |
| 4 | **Develop OKR system** (Enhance the way we manage DAO to maximize efficiency and effectiveness)   | The DAO has come up with the OKR process.  The DAO has the first set of OKRs in the mainnet.  | (1) Continue the discussion on OKRs [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/99) (2) Finalize the [OKR process](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/252) | This term a [meeting](../DAO%20Meetings/OKR%20Meeting%20d2fbad408f534a9b92e320cfa1082bda.md) was held to have a better understanding of the suggested objectives and key results. The council came up with a good visual and representation of an initial possible list of objectives and their corresponding key results. |
| 5 | **Conduct a training session in DAO for writing proposals successfully.** (Develop a successful series of training for DAO members in order to increase their knowledge and engagement.) | (1) Important and excellent suggestions in discord are converted into approved proposals (2) An informative material from the training is distributed among working groups as a guide (3) Less negative feedback on proposals wrt to how they are written | (1) Encourage leads to attend the training, in the absence of the lead, a worker from the group should substitute the lead (2) Create an enjoyable yet informative training session plan (3) Collect all the questions and suggestions prior to training and see to it they are addressed (4) Plan the training session carefully and ensure that the objectives will be met at the end  | The proposal titled [Training: Making Effective Proposals](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/184) has been approved. And as suggested by another CM this task is passed on to HR, as this is part of community engagement. Currently, HR is looking for a trainer for this activity. |
| 6 | **Monitoring Dashboards** 
(Establish operational monitoring tools to improve decision-making in DAO-wide or WG-wide contexts.) | Council, DP, and SP dashboards are developed and rolled out.  | Develop requirements for the dashboards. Create the following dashboards  (1)  Storage Dashboard: health of storage system overall, status of each node, traffic and buckets information, an indication of failures (2)  Distribution Dashboard: health of distribution system overall, status of each node, traffic and buckets information, an indication of failures (3)  Council Dashboard: Budget info, Channels, Videos,  Forum categories etc | The council had a call with the Dapplookers team and a [workshop](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/300) will be conducted next term so the community will be aware, especially the workers of DAO of how to use the financial dashboards and their basic functionalities and features. Currently, HR is working on the coordination and planning on how to roll out this workshop. |
| 7 | The playback feature works smoothly and quickly. | The average playback response is less than 0.5s | Doing an investigation to identify what is actually causing the video playback issues. It could be: Slow GraphQL responses / laggy QN infrastructure, Other webpage elements, Distributor Nodes | This was a last-minute addition in this list, the council has come up with a [Project plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/299) for this and expected to solve this issue by next term. |

## 4. **Working Groups**

**Table 4.1. Working groups**

| No. | **Working group** | **Lead** | **Plan** | **Report** | **Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

They worked on several high-priorities including YPP testing, Ephesus testing, Hackathon, Validator module design, and some issues in Pioneer. in the DAO despite the fact that they are low on manpower. |
| 2 | Storage | **yyagi** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/280?post=1257](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/280?post=1257) | [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Preliminary-Storage-WG-Report-Period-6-a706eb33b1d440cf885dd617a31bdd52](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Storage-WG-Report-Period-6-a706eb33b1d440cf885dd617a31bdd52?pvs=21) | As planned, the lead did work on the [public dashboard](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/166)(to be continued for the next term) and actively gave his participation in YPP testing. All in all, the wg’s operation is good, there were no recorded issues this term. |
| 3 | Distribution | **l1dev** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=1317](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=1317) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/2?post=1401](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/2?post=1401) | As per the priorities for the past term which are checking DP performance and improving the salary metric which the group is making a progress on, the lead also take on the high-priority task of the playback feature issue and currently working on seeing up the team for investigation. The lead also participated in YPP testing. To sum it up, there was an activity seen this term especially WRT to the discussion of the current issues regarding Atlas functionality and salary metric. |
| 4 | Forum | **songoku** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/279?post=1255](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/279?post=1255) | [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Forum-WG-Report-Term-6-on-going-a4915723524d423a9400d258cad61b39](https://www.notion.so/Forum-WG-Report-Term-6-a4915723524d423a9400d258cad61b39?pvs=21) | All the planned items for this term were done. Compared to the activity in Term 5, there has been a decreased activity(obviously because of the ending of Crew3 activity) but there were a handful of meaningful and high-quality discussions in Forum this term from the community. |
| 5 | Apps | None | None | None | Since there was no lead, there was no report done this term. I think the closest related document to have a grasp of what has happened this term is to read on YPP testing and the improvement of the playback feature which can be found on the OKR Table for this term in Table 3.1.  |
| 6 | Content | **igrex** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/87?post=1258](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/87?post=1258) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/107?post=1397](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/107?post=1397) | The overall operations of the group went as planned, there was a decrease in the number of video uploads, its duration and size this is because the Crew3 tasks have reduced this term. The Content Rewards Policy was also approved by the council this term and will be implemented in Term 7, it was very good of the lead to conduct a team [meeting](../DAO%20Meetings/Curator%20Meeting%202f7f755a6b6f4729835ebb66a0480965.md) to discuss the new reward scheme and wgs operation (work processes) as a whole prior to this. |
| 7 | HR | **Codefi_keyz** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/119?post=1273](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/119?post=1273) | [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Term-06-Report-9f03eac11dcc49df8fd409223ea2cb32](https://www.notion.so/Term-06-Report-9f03eac11dcc49df8fd409223ea2cb32?pvs=21) | Based on the planned task at the beginning of the term, progress was done on each item. The team is working on a variety of tasks such as onboarding, surveys, databases (the updating of these needs to be done termly), community engagement and activities, and facilitation of elections etc. All in all, the operation went well, and improvements could be done in the team’s operations the same with other working groups. |
