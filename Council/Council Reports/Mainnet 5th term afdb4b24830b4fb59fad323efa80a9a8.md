## 2**. Summary**

The Council's term was relatively successful in terms of tasks performed, with no major hiccups, and the budget was allocated as planned. 

**Primary focus**

We focused primarily on the tasks outlined in the manifesto, including OKR development, YPP Testing, HR process improvements, increasing the validator set, and a few others. 

We made significant progress with OKR, created a mature document on the OKR process guide, and received lots of feedback on the OKR list. YPP Testing is slightly behind schedule, but the staging network is set up and SP workers are being hired. We anticipate that all tests will be completed in a week or so. For HR, new formats and guides are being implemented. The initial proposal to increase the validator set was declined, but we have come up with a less risky proposal that suggests only increasing the validator set by five.

**Issues emerged**

Extra tasks have appeared during the term. The first major task is a Runtime Upgrade, which is too complex to be verified by the current council and will need to be reviewed by the next one, as it is a very important undertaking that necessitates a lot of effort. The second major and contentious of these is the suggestion to introduce daily WG reports. We are still debating whether this should be implemented and if so, what form it should take

**Takeaways**

The key takeaway from this term is the importance of enhanced communication between leads and within the council team, which should ideally be conducted through voice calls rather than just messaging. Furthermore, improvements need to be made to the Pioneer notification system and a system should be put in place to keep track of conversations across Pioneer Discord and other platforms. Without this, conversations can become fragmented across multiple sites, making it difficult to stay informed and on track.

## 3. **Tasks Status**

**Table 3.1. Tasks status**

| **#** | **Objective** | **Key Results** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Conduct YPP Testing (Make sure infra is fully ready for the YPP launch) | YPP testing completed:(1) Agree on YPP testing terms  (2) Set up testing environment  (3) Conduct tests (4) Provide results to JSG  (5) Make necessary adjustments to the Storage system (if any) For more info see the Pioneer discussion https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/180?post=777 | The staging network is operational, the council has been selected, the lead of the Service Provider (SP) has been appointed, and the recruitment of the SP's workers is ongoing. Instead of employing beta testers, it was decided to proceed with automated testing scripts. |
| 2 | Increase validator set  (Make sure that the blockchain is highly reliable by having a large number of reliable nodes) | Decision on validator set made: (1) Make a final decision on the validator set increase. (2) Finalize research on the validator system stability. For more info see the Pioneer discussion https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/186?post=772 | The proposal for a validator set increase to 40 expired for some reason. The council come up with another proposal — The v[alidator set increase to 35](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/170) and it was approved by all council members with a constitutionality of 4, so, the next and succeeding council will have to decide on it.  |
| 3 | Polish onboarding process (make a smooth onboarding experience for newcomers) | The onboarding process reviewed and improved: (1) Describe “as is” onboarding process  (2)Identify issues pertaining to onboarding (3) Describe “to be” onboarding process (4) Implement new onboarding process. For more info see the Pioneer discussion https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/192 | Due to the influx of newcomers, several issues with regard to the verification and the discord invite links were discovered upon the review of it. Necessary actions were taken such as making the [verification channel a-read-only](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/138) and making sure that all the discord invite links that are shared and posted outside Joystream are working and not expired. The HR WG also came up with a comprehensive [**onboarding guide**](https://www.notion.so/HR-Onboarding-809fb3fba41f45f5a8bb96bc2a837205?pvs=21) for the workers to use. There are still related tasks and issues with onboarding, one is the #faucet channel and membership invites info. |
| 4 | Develop OKR system (Enhance the way we manage DAO to maximize efficiency and effectiveness)   | OKR system developed: (1) OKRs rules and requirements are developed and approved (2) OKRs are developed for all WGs (3) OKRs are communicated | This term, there was a very long discussion made by the council regarding [OKRs](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/99) and the [OKR Process](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/252). Apart from that feedback from JSGenesis was also received twice. By the end, the council has not come up with an official set of OKRS for the DAO, nevertheless, the progress is good. |
| 5 | Develop Community Strategy Draft (Enhance the way we manage DAO to maximize efficiency and effectiveness) | Strategy draft developed and posted on the Pioneer forum | Developing a strategy is similar to the OKR work we are currently doing. Therefore, if we implement a long-term OKR system, it will encompass most of the elements in the Community Strategy document. |

## 4. **Working Groups**

**Table 4.1. Working groups**

| **#** | **Working group** | **Lead** | **Plan** | **Report** | **Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Builders | **chaos77** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/62?post=746](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/62?post=746) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/15](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/15) | This term, the working group lead was occupied with tasks regarding YPP testing and launch aside from the planned task the group has for this term. There was progress for the group’s priorities such as Pioneer backend, validator module and dev, and financial module design and dev, but with QN update with validator data — the lead was not able to acquire the right talent to do this. |
| 2 | Storage | **yyagi** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/197?post=824](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/197?post=824) | [**https://www.notion.so/joystream/Preliminary-Storage-WG-Report-Period-5-7121b35362224c2eb18722a43e054a0c**](https://www.notion.so/Preliminary-Storage-WG-Report-Period-5-7121b35362224c2eb18722a43e054a0c?pvs=21) | The storage system went smoothly, though we won't have all the details until the final SP report is out. The public dashboard is in progress, one interested worker has been engaged. SP Lead assisted on test cases for YPP testing and he is in the process of hiring people for SP work on the staging network. |
| 3 | Distribution | **l1dev** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=836](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=836) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/2?post=1240](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/2?post=1240) | The distribution system went smoothly, without any issues. But the current version of the report didn't list out metrics of the DP system nor the progress on the priorities stated in the plan. Once the full version of the report is released, we'll have more info. |
| 4 | Forum | **songoku** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/179](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/179) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz//#/forum/thread/272](https://pioneerapp.xyz//#/forum/thread/272) | All planned tasks were completed and the requests for categories and threads were done. This term although, the FWG did extra in moderating because of the forum post quest on crew3. Also, there is an increase in the creation of forum threads and forum posts by 58% and 112% respectively contributing to the total number of posts in the Forum becoming 1,235. The quality of the posts cannot be assessed at this point and needs to be looked at in the next term. |
| 5 | Apps | **klaudiusz (RESIGNED)** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/65?post=818](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/65?post=818) | NO REPORT FOR THIS TERM | The lead resigned in the middle of the term due to some personal reasons and lack of direction of the WG as per the lead. There is a floating task about SDK and the former lead might or might not finish it. |
| 6 | Content | **igrex** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/87?post=781](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/87?post=781) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/107?post=1236](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/107?post=1236) | The working group's overall operation went fine. However, there is still no Content Rewards Policy approved by the Council and discussions are ongoing. For videos and NFTs, there was a  24.14% and 88% increase respectively, but on the contrary, the content total size and duration decreased by 13.26% and 47.3% respectively. Censored videos have a significant increase of 900% (from 1 to 10) and the for this term 6 video duplicates were found. The Crew3 campaign tasks might have contributed to the results of the abrupt changes in the variables stated above. Lastly, the errors that occurred when uploading lessened from 3 to 1. |
| 7 | HR | **Codefi_keyz** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/119?post=764](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/119?post=764) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/273](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/273) | Aside from MWG, this group was loaded with heavy tasks this term especially onboarding newcomers and making sure they get the support and assistance they need. In the working group’s plan for the 5ht council term, there were many unfinished tasks due to the unexpected number of newcomers entering the Discord server and to accommodate them, the lead hired more people in the group. The group made progress in maintaining several databases and was active in facilitating hiring for the need of the other working groups. About Council Election, announcements were done timely in discord and telegram (official and RU), though this term, there were no interviews done with the council candidates. All in all, the group did well this term, was able to work under high pressure, and even served administrative help to the council from time to time. |
| 8 | Membership | **tomato** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/229?post=1017](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/229?post=1017) | [**https://joystream.notion.site/Council-Term-5-Report-1782d644b18d4455b8efc3c4cc2c97b4**](https://www.notion.so/Council-Term-5-Report-1782d644b18d4455b8efc3c4cc2c97b4?pvs=21) | The Membership WG went pretty well overall, though we had an issue with the faucet running out of money, and we couldn't get it fixed right away because of a technical issue. Thankfully we figured it out quickly. Membership WG Lead finished up the task of figuring out the faucet addresses and usage rates, made some small progress on getting apps to use their own addresses, looked into user verification requirements but decided it wasn't important, collected data on faucet use and membership trends, and put off discussing any proposals related to the membership working group until next term. Membership lead got started on the council secretary role. |
| 9. | Marketing | **leet_joy** | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=754](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=754) | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/46?post=1234](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/46?post=1234) | The report provided by the lead was very comprehensive. It is worth checking. The group made significant work this term, the response from the crew3 campaign was not expected but is very good.  There were also many tasks that were not accomplished, however, it is understandable since the group was manually checking the quests submitted by the participants of crew3. |

| **#** | **Task** | **Description** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Constantly identify improvements in the DAO | Through survey forms, the HRWG will need to come up with questionnaires to get info on different areas of DAO | Google forms were distributed to the leads, and 6 out of the 9 leads completed the form. The topic is about salary, the scope of work of the leads, and some feedback and concerns Due to the heavy workload for HR this term, the raw data was given to the council on the last day, thus, there is no interpretation and analysis yet.  |
| 2 | Enhancing social media posts/tweets by MWG | A CM offered help to MWG in improving their tweets in aiming to onboard more newcomers in Discord and attract more users in the Apps and Pioneer | A CM provided feedback to MWG about tweets on Twitter, first at the beginning of the term, and as there was not much visible progress seen, the CM again provided feedback with suggestions, ideas, and sample tweets at the end of the term. JoystreamDAO twitter: [https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg) |
| 3 | Promoting the usage of Forum | Making it a requirement that every WG has to create at least one Forum discussion per term and include it in their term report. | There was not much progress done on this. Although during the council and leads call, a CM asked for feedback from the leads about requiring each WG to come up with a forum post per term. It was implied that leads do not agree with this as this will require additional time from the WG.  |
| 4 | Scaling strategy for storage and distribution working groups | Gather in-depth feedback from stakeholders and build a scaling strategy for storage and distribution working groups: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/112](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/112) | The work is still in progress. We expect it to be completed in the 6th term.  |
| 5 | Reporting cycle management | Collect report from the distribution working group, warn the lead, and compare it with their plan: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=540](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=540)  Collect report from the app working group, warn the lead, and compare it with their plan: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/65?post=542](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/65?post=542) | The leads were reminded about the Reporting Cycle at the beginning of the term since they submitted their plans yet without the council’s. Also, a few leads were not able to comply with the reporting deadline. In relation to this, there was a new [Council Report](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/157) and [Plan Template](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/158) approved this term.

 |
| 6 | Monitoring of WG performance | Track the performance of builders according to a strategic plan which they built themselves: [https://www.notion.so/Strategic-Plan-92630b73c91b44b797e289da2523c504](https://www.notion.so/Strategic-Plan-92630b73c91b44b797e289da2523c504?pvs=21) | All the working groups were given feedback not only BWG. Please see it here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/205](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/205) |
| 7 | DAO Workers Database | Complete working Group Database on Notion with HR WG for informed decisions: [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Working-Group-Database-e8a1059e3fa44efeb2e5c3184e633d70](https://www.notion.so/Working-Group-Database-e8a1059e3fa44efeb2e5c3184e633d70?pvs=21) | At the beginning of the term, it was discovered that this database has given the minimum effort to complete it. The working group was reminded then and upon checking at the end of the term - the task is still not completed.  |
| 8 | Crew3 Status | Council should judge the effectiveness of the Crew3 initiative when it's complete. | The crew3 campaign finishes in more or less 10 days, however, the council for this term asked for the first week's statistics of the results of crew3. It was posted in Forum to seek [feedback](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/231) from the other leads, the council, and the community. It was too early to assess the effectiveness during this term, but it has brought many newcomers in discord, followers on Twitter and more users in TG. |
| 9 | Content Policy approval | Content lead prepared content policy, the council can vote on this: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/115](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/115) | The council and CWG still need to come up with an approved Content Rewards Policy. CWG wants to assess videos wrt instead of channels which the council wants. The discussion is ongoing [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/154) and [there](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/267).  |
| 10 | Communication with Leads | WGs report submission deadline was changed, and the council should share the new deadline with WGs. | This term, one call between the council and the leads took place in discord with this [meeting agenda](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/258), and the meeting minutes is provided [here](../DAO%20Meetings/Council%20&%20Leads%20Meeting%20de2ff7c1762f4a8aa24098505c348733.md). Seven people attended the meeting - 2 council members and 5 leads. It is safe to conclude that the meeting is successful.  |
| 11 | Salary justification for DWG | Distributors didn’t submit a report yet but the lead planned to provide a salary formula for distributors, the current council should consider the salaries of distributors according to the formula if the council accepts the formula. | The work is still in progress. We expect it to be completed in the 6th term.  |

## 7. Council Daily Reports

*Comment: here should be a link to a Pioneer discussion with Council Daily Reports*

Here are daily reports: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/182](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/182) 

## 8. Recommendations for Next Council

Major tasks and activities, that need to be focused on more in the next council term

- To look into CWG’s report and its summary in Council Report, perhaps more coordination among the Council, CWG and MWG(wrt to Crew 3 campaign) is needed to improve the stats gathered in comparison to Term 4.
