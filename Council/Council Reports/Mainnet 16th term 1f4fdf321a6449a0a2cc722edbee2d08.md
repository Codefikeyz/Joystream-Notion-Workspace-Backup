## 2. Summary

Term 16 was quite intensive in terms of workload, and we managed to achieve several records, such as:

- 1k+ new memberships
- 24k+ [new videos](https://dapplooker.com/dashboard/joystream-mainnet-dashboard-328)
- YPP sign-ups record ([70 in one week](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1125385206346559488/1139597324654477373))
- The JOY token's value reached [0.015 USDT per JOY](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/JOYSTREAM_USDT), and we witnessed the highest trading volume during this Term.
- 25 million tokens from the council budget were [burned](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/527).

Proposal to [burn 50 mJOY](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/458) from the council budget did not pass. However the council still initiated burning 25 mJOY from the council budget, all transactions can be found here - [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/527](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/527)

The proposal to reserve [15 mJOY for listing purposes](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/468) was approved, and we opted to retain this amount in the council budget instead of actually minting it to the multi-sig.

HRWG managed to collect [comprehensive Weekly summary](https://github.com/0x2bc/council/blob/main/weekly_summary_12-Aug-2023.md) and added this initiative to one of WG tasks.

New [BWG compensation model](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/455) was approved. Builders will no longer measure their work based on AP but will instead propose development projects to the council for approval. Once the proposals are approved, they will commence development, and upon completing these projects, they will receive payment.

SWG initiated the upscaling of their servers due to an overload caused by a surge in YPP sign-ups and certain video game streaming channels that acquired a significant amount of our capacity.

During this term, we observed numerous organic mentions of Joystream on YouTube and Twitter by various creators and publishers.

There were several Discord server [improvements](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/453) done during Term 16.

Bridging [JOY to Ethereum with Sygma protocol](https://twitter.com/JoystreamDAO/status/1691320946840281088) initiative carried by JSG and it’s Twitter Spaces was promoted by the MWG.

MWG continues to diligently work on enhancing our web3 presence, engaging with creators on YouTube, and conducting various marketing activities to foster robust JOY markets and raise project awareness within crypto communities.
