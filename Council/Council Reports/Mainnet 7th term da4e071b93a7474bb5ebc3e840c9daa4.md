## 2**.** Summary

The Council's term was relatively successful in terms of tasks performed, and the budget was allocated as planned (except for Crew3 second sprint budget, which we had forgotten to include in the Council Plan for the 7th term, this payment is allocated in advance and will be distributed among participants after 20 April).

**Primary focus**

The focus for this term was primarily the items that are written in the OKR table represented in Table 3.1.

The DAO-wide priority in the order of urgency and importance were the following ones:

- Finalize and approve DAO OKRs for the second quarter. 
This was the main priority for this term and we accomplished it. The list of approved OKRs ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/216](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/216)) contains significant changes from the previously discussed model and could be subject to review by Council 8. The OKR process described is simplified and could be improved (including deadlines, etc).
- YT-sync test was completed at the beginning of the term with no major issues found.
- Ephesus Upgrade was reviewed and approved.
- Playback improvement - there were issues reported in some regions (North-East Europe) with Playback, necessary testing was performed by DWG and 2 additional distributor nodes (locations: Helsinki and St.Petersburg) were launched which led to significant playback improvements in affected regions.
- App working group lead was hired to perform this role.
- DWG and SWG salaries formula was designed and published on Pioneer ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327)) to collect further feedback from the community.
- The second Crew3 sprint was successfully designed and launched by the marketing working group. We allocated a 400K JOY budget for this campaign.

## 3. **Tasks Status**

**Table 3.1. Termly OKRs**

| 7 | Conduct a training session in DAO for writing proposals successfully. | (1) Important and excellent suggestions in discord are converted into approved proposals (2) An informative material from the training is distributed among working groups as a guide (3) Less negative feedback on proposals wrt to how they are written | (1) Encourage leads to attend the training, in the absence of the lead, a worker from the group should substitute the lead (2) Create an enjoyable yet informative training session plan (3) Collect all the questions and suggestions prior to training and see to it they are addressed (4) Plan the training session carefully and ensure that the objectives will be met at the end | The session for training on creating proposals is planned to take place on Thursday 6th April 2023.

## 7. Council Daily Reports

In this period, "daily reports" were posted on the discord every few days.

Here is the link for the reports: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/330](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/330)

## 8. Recommendations for Next Council

- Review approved Q2 OKRs and OKR Process, suggest improvements, help working group leads in integrating the OKR system, and help leads with creating group-wise OKRs with measurable Key Results.
- Playback issue - contribute to the development of automatic systems to monitor/test the delivery of content to the user.
- Finalize approval of Ephesus Upgrade (if there are no problems with the upgrade). Make sure the leads are aware of deadlines and actions that need to be prioritized ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175?post=346](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/175?post=346)).
- Review the proposed SWG/DWG salary formula ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/327))
- Work out the hackathon plan and budget, and finalize the hackathon tasks ([https://github.com/traumschule/community-repo/tree/events/events](https://github.com/traumschule/community-repo/tree/events/events)).
- The HR group seems to be spending too much. We need to check the activity of the group. Maybe we should not pay 3 workers for welcome messages in the welcome channel. Newbies don't see these welcome messages until they are verified. Does this make sense?
- Look for a community speaker that can attend Binance AMA and Twitter hangouts.
- Conduct Handover/Retro session first time ([see proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/197)).
