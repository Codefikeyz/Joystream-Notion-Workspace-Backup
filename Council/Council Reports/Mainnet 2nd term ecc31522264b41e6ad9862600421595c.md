## Recommendations for the next council term

1. Request plans from leads - [Proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/45) and [Approved format](../Archive/WGs%20Term%20Plan%20Template%20(mainnet)%20f89e55f5299447e5a32cc4a810218125.md)
2. Increase the Marketing Lead reward (a mistake was made by council) - Ref: [Proposal](https://www.notion.so/Lenstube-xyz-5f834e228c6d4fce82f69a3eebac2e73?pvs=21) 
3. Questions to AMA - [Forum thread](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/37), Do Council need to hold AMA every term? 
4. Monitor and Manage the council [bounty](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/32) - [Proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/52) 
5. Recieve and analyse research report from SWG lead to make storage WG scalable and sustainable
6. Number of active validators - [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812343711870091285/1064595516769439925](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812343711870091285/1064595516769439925)
7. Decide what to do with Builders WG in the light of the: Have confirmed with JSG that only one person is working on Pioneer. This confirms my understanding that Pioneer isn't a priority for now. Whatever works - works, whatever doesn't work - very low priority.
8. Have [DWG questionnaire](Mainnet%202nd%20term/DWG%20Questionaire%20a3733b04b5b541029c1541eec1a19760.md) filled and published
9. [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/33](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/33)  
10. Follow-up with JSG on increasing transparency on VCs and their plans. VCs have massive amount of unlocked `JOY`, potentially dangerous situation if the listing happens in 2023 before DAO vesting ends **January 18, 2023 10:07 AM (GMT+3)**
11. [Ongoing research](Mainnet%202nd%20term%20ecc31522264b41e6ad9862600421595c.md)
