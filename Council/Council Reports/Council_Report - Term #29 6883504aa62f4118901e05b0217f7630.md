### Storage WG

- **Implement the Council's proposed reorganization model for the WG.**
- 🟡 (delayed) Develop a detailed plan for the DWG + SWG merge, which will include:
    - Identifying the geographies based on the sessions registered by the distributor.
    - Reducing the total headcount of DWG and SWG by having most operators run both nodes
    - Exploring further reduction of the replication factor, subject to an acceptable level of data object loss
    - Exploring a deep-freeze layer for storage.
    - Relocating the servers to clusters closer to the geographies with the highest sessions, as well as optimizing locations within current geographies (taking the lead on this but in collaboration with Mr. Bovo)
    - Noting that most of the sessions we have are coming to the homepage and scrolling a few pages down, so distributor nodes mostly have it cached. This should be taken into consideration when choosing the requirements for the storage machines. Review if we actually need the fast and expensive machines. Incorporate to cost cutting plan.
