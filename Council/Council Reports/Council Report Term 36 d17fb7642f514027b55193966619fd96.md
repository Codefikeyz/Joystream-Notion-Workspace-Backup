## 3**. Term Highlights**

This term marked the first time no plan was approved by Council due to differing opinions among the CMs on what should be included. We had two proposals for each plan, but both were rejected. The V2 proposal received 2 votes, while V1 received 1 vote. In the report, we'll primarily refer to V2 since it garnered more support. See [Council Plan V1](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/951) , [Council Plan V2](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/952)

Proposal 972 ([link](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/972)), which focused on one leading Council member, was put forward to the community and gained enough traction that most of the candidates in the election ended up supporting it.

Tangem - 177 wallets paid (proposals [970](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/970) and [971](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/971)) and shipped to Jsgenesis

Infrastructure Compensation - 2362 USDT was sent to SWG/DWG workers for their servers ([report](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/890?post=6972))

There are ongoing issues with YT-Sync that Jsgenesis is working on. This slightly impacts the number of videos uploaded to the platform.

Council 36 approved a signal to use a cap for Ema30 at 0.015 (proposal [965](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/965))

**Argo bridge**

- Joystream DAO is launching an official bridged JOY token on the Base L2 network. The ERC20 token contract address is [0x8761155c814c807cD3CcD15B256D69D3C10f198C](https://basescan.org/address/0x8761155c814c807cD3CcD15B256D69D3C10f198C). (proposal [964](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/964))
- The Argo bridge app is hosted at [https://bridge.joystream.org/](https://bridge.joystream.org/). The bridge was unpaused, and test transfers were executed using the EthAdmin multisig.
- Uniswap Funding Proposals:
    - council moved 1.5M to BASE EthAdmin multisig (proposals [978](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/978) and [979](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/979))
    - council moved 10K USDT to EthAdmin multisig on Base network (proposal [977](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/977))
- Argo bridge Base signers & pausers were approved (proposal [961](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/961))
- During the term transition, the council and builders werec finalizing LP settings. Once DAO funds are added to the LP and a signal proposal with LP parameters is approved, bridge announcements will be released.

- Argo bridge launch [marketing plan](https://www.notion.so/Argo-bridge-marketing-plan-ccc178efeae2463ca18daf5d6ec6c5a1?pvs=21)

YPP payments: During the term transition, it is unclear who will be responsible for executing YPP payments as CWGL is resigning from their role. For this transition period, the council requested to return JOY from YPP accounts back to the council budget ([tx1](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.joystream.org#/extrinsics/decode/0x1309bfe300000000000000fc4bb0a850130000000000000000009c52657475726e696e672052657761726473204163632042756467657420746f20436f756e63696c) and [tx2](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.joystream.org#/extrinsics/decode/0x1309bee30000000000000016e0a5d9ef030000000000000000009c52657475726e696e672052657761726473204163632042756467657420746f20436f756e63696c)) and let a newly appointed person set up new accounts for this purpose.

The PR for S3 support in Colossus nodes got a first round of review from JSG and builders are working on finalising the PR: [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/5150](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/5150)

Note: council plan was approved by 2/3 CM (proposal [952](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/952)), there was another council plan proposed by l1dev (proposal [951](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/951)) but was rejected. It's worth mentioning that the council tasks in both proposed council plans were the same.

## 8**.  Recommendations for the Next Council**

**Overall**

- **0x2bc**: Continue working on Q3 OKRs.
- **0x2bc:** Create openings for the BWGL, CWGL, and DWGL positions.
- **0x2bc:**  Get the EMA cap implemented
- **0x2bc:**  Gather insights on the results of Proposal Thread 972
- **l1dev:** set up more gw and ask FM / workers what they want to see

**Bridge**

- **0x2bc:** Roll out Uniswap AMM V3 into production; officially launch Argo Bridge; host a Twitter Space with the Base team.

**CWG**

- **0x2bc:** Consider hiring a CWGL who can bring new creative impulses to the DAO (such as introducing new methods for onboarding small video communities or attracting top creators)
- **0x2bc:** Revisit the YPP rewards program; focus on paying only for valuable contributions and partnerships with top creators.
- **0x2bc:** Setup new YPP accounts
- **leet_joy:** Move creators support task from CWG to HRWG

**MWG** 

- **0x2bc:** Ambassador program: Focus on the few high-impact ambassadors who are actually delivering quality. The rest might not be worth keeping onboard due to the management effort compared to the limited output.
- **0x2bc:** Continue searching for a Content Manager to produce high-quality content for social media.
- **0x2bc:** Consider searching for a  Twitter Manager; ensure weekly Twitter meetings are consistently held; Obtain full Twitter access

**Infra**

- **0x2bc:** Consider hiring one infra lead, both for DWG and SWG; ensure that infra operations run smoothly.
- **0x2bc:** Further optimize DWG and SWG server costs; explore ways to save on storing low-quality media files.
- **leet_joy**: Introduce archive servers for storage (deep storage as emergency backup) that could unlock reducing replication at min risk.
