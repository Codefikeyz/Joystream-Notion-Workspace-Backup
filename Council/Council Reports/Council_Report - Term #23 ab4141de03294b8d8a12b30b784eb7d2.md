## 8**. Recommendations for Next Council**

1. Burn more of the council treasury. This is an important security and operational consideration to make.
2. Calculate a new council treasury replenishment, such that combined with burning of more tokens the amount in the council treasury is not too high — the goal is that the council treasury contains enough “sensible” runway for some period of operations for the DAO
3. Reconsider CRP program. Improve NFT and Content featuring on Gleev, add info on the report
4. Initiate the development of Wallet Connect
5. Assessment of the results of benchmarking test and provide more support to DWG if necessary
6. Ensure related QA testing  and tasks for Nara Upgrade are delivered on time
7. Assess the current DAO spending
8. JIP - accomplish the necessary tasks from the council such as setting up a team of editors and creating new categories in Forum
