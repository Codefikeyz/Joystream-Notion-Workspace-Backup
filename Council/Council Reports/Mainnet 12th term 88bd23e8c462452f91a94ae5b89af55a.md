## 2. Summary

The overall term went smoothly.

- **Financials**
    - The actual budgets were aligned closely with the planned budgets, with an expenditure of 1,310,897 JOY compared to the anticipated 1,345,491 JOY.
    - In light of a robust DAO treasury, where the refill rate exceeds spending, a proposal has been put forward to reduce the refill rate to mitigate associated risks.
- **Listing**
    - We anticipate the listing to occur on the 20th of June.
    - One of the significant challenges faced this term was preparing for the listing. Nonetheless, we made substantial progress in attracting new members. Our [**JoystreamDAO Twitter**](https://twitter.com/JoystreamDAO) account grew to over 30,000 subscribers, and our Discord community reached over 10,000 subscribers.
    - Our DAO members actively participated in multiple AMA sessions, including on platforms like OKEX and Bedego Listing AMA.
    - We made a concerted effort to improve our video upload metrics, resulting in a significant increase from 2,214 to 9,559 uploaded videos.
    - A series of proposals were developed and discussed to ensure our preparedness for the listing. These included the [**JOYS/USD Value For Budgeting Purposes**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/432), [**DAO Stablecoins Treasury**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/409), and we tested [**Multisig functionality**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/433) to better understand its applicability to us.
- **Compensation system**
    - We engaged in productive discussions and brainstorming on how to enhance our current compensation system. For further details, see [**Leads Scoring And Effects On Salary**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/427) and [**Salaries Assessment**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/428?post=3868).
- **OKRs**
    - We developed a [**draft for Q3 OKR**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/435), held a meeting to discuss it, and conducted further interactions for refinement.
    - We made moderate progress on the Q2 assessment. This area needs additional focus and will be addressed in the next term.
- Validators
    - We did moderate progress on staking and validating promotional activities (refer to the [**Validators**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/421) , [**Incentives For JOY Staking](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/381?post=3951)** topic). These areas need additional focus and will be addressed in the next term.
