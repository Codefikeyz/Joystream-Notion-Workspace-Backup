**Traffic by continent**

The first version of the dashboard to visualize data from logs was delivered by DWG [https://joystream.koalva.io/operator-logs](https://joystream.koalva.io/operator-logs)

AMA in Twitter Spaces for outside web3 was organized by MWG and will take place on May 22. @bedeho will be there as a speaker.

The DAO gateway title was selected by voting and the [winning](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/306) submission was - **Joyspace.**

The DAO gateway logo contest was [announced](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/status/1658012494953353217) and submissions will be accepted until May 28.

Several profiles were made by MWG including [ThePass](https://thepass.to/dao/Joystream/DAOPage), [link3](https://link3.to/791CYCMW). Id @joystream if was reserved/minted on [link3](https://link3.to/joystream) and [Bluesky social](https://bsky.app/).

During this term Zealy’s third sprint that continuously updated and supported by the marketing working group. Sybil attack was noticed by the community and will be addressed by MWG.

To support early YPP creators new quests were introduced to the Zealy campaign to follow creators on Gleev.

Several discussions took place on incentives for [node-runners](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/383) and [staking](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/381).

Server cost compensation [discussions](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/380) for DWG/SWG.

There is a discrepancy between the Planned and Actual spending, largely due to the extra funds needed for MWG to refill. These additional funds were not used for Term 10 spending, but rather for next term WG spenginds (Zealy payouts, AMA, etc).

The YPP referral program was [introduced](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/378?post=3537) and discussed. MWG will test the approach proposed by JSG to utilize the current referral program functionality.

New HR working group lead @jen4ph was [hired](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/291).

The app working group lead was missing and the council is actively looking for a new lead. Current APP lead was irresponsive during this term.

Some signal proposals were not submitted since not all cm were available to vote.

Reduce validator set to 35 proposal was [submitted](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/314) and approved by the council 10.
