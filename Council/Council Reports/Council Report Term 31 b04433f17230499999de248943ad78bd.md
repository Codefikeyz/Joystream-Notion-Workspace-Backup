🟡 Deliver S3 backup support in Colossus

- *Work has been started but Luxor development took a bit longer than expected, there is a little progress.*

🟢 Investigate/create tooling for monitoring block times and validators’ performance.

- A widget was added to [joyutils.org](http://joyutils.org/) that allows to easily check average block time

**Jenny’s recommendations/feedback:**

- Kindly fix the report tooling as this is used regularly by HR for the Weekly Report and the council for the report
- Review WG composition and pay based on the task priorities

- Expedite the hiring for the deployment of CEPH and Kubernetes

🟢 R&D on OKR for next quarter with emphasis on comparing user data collected through gleev

### Content WG

Lead: Dmtrmltsv

[Plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/87?post=6279) [Report](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/107?post=6483)

Tasks:

🟢 Maintaining homepage feed with weights and pinned videos

🟢 Creator support in discord, email, github tickets

🟢 NFT featured carousel mgt

🟡 YPP verification, and payouts

- The supposed take over of YPP payouts did not happen this term because the lead was fully consumed with the works in the CRT

Objectives

Implement Segment and Amplitude for Creator Activity Tracking

🟢 Onboard 5 creators to CRTs and conduct high touch usability tests on dev env

🟡 Collaborate with Robert to create CRT onboarding videos for homepage and dashboard ob flow (5 steps)

- *Started and ongoing - needs a stable environment to see full CRT features*

🟡 Launch New Creator Discord and grow community to 250 creators

- *Started, not completed - looking forwards to hire a replacement worker for the task*

🟡 Launch creator engagement program: [https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/5975](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/5975)

**Jenny’s recommendations/feedback:**

- Budget for the community manager role should be reviewed, preferably there should be a fixed number of hours per day for this role (e.g. maximum of 3-4 hrs per day to cover all the discord, GH and email support) the rate per hour can be reviewed as well. I see minimal value of answering mostly these repeated concerns about pay and tier review.
- WRT to the lead’s plan/request to pay himself at full capacity rate for Term 31, I’m afraid I am not giving my approval. As per the [proposal](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/817) the lead was hired at 75% involvement and during the term, and this concern about the massive work overtime was not brought to the attention of the council at any time during the term.
- RE: `Forgot Password and Wallet Seed Issue`, I recommend putting extra warning visible to the creators about this upon the account creation or resetting their password

### Marketing WG

Lead: Leet_joy
[Plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=6364) [Report](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=6476)

Tasks: 

🟢 Create a MWG operations public Notion/ [Kanban board](https://www.notion.so/20ac1adc2a18455183d55f028220f0e5?pvs=21)

🟢 Ambassador program promotion and management

**🟢** Social media content management

🟡 Execute a video production and publishing campaign that highlights the Creator Token and YPP program on popular YouTube channels.

- *Dev enviroment is not ready by the end of Term 31 for content creation.*

🟡 Digital marketing - create and manage new campaigns

- *X’s is done. YT and Meta’s ads - still on the testing phase about the impressions ratio targeting general crypto audience*

🟢 CMC communities campaign

🟢 Response to marketing proposals

**Jenny’s recommendations/feedback:**

- WRT to your report’s budgeting section, please clarify next time how much were spent to ambassadors in total, workers, promotions etc. It would be better to see how the spendings are distributed in categories/areas
- Please showcase the ambassadors more in the Joystream Discord server. As the first phase ended, it would be interesting to see the ambassadors who got inducted and information about their work.

- This means they are not accounted for here and the planned spending is quite higher than actual spending.

Additional comments:

- *Due to the implemented vesting payments for the leads, all the salaries were sent through discretionary payments, the report tooling captures the Joy per block salary instead.*
- *HRWG and CWG’s ending budgets are higher than expected because they have made the discretionary payments after the term ended. Kindly see the working group reports for more information.*

## 8**.  Recommendations for the Next Council**

- Jenny: Review the OKR thread and pass a proposal for the Q2 OKRs within the 1st week of the term
- Jenny: Review lead salaries and tasks suggested by the working group leads in the plan ensure they align the council duration. Despite the general increase in salaries with vested payments and given that the council term shifted to 28 days, the progress in tasks seemed to have not matched the duration of the council term, nothing significant improvement compared to that of 15-day council term period. This is also advisable since the market is not doing so well currently
- Jenny: Consider requiring all the DAO workers to write their daily updates, might be a good way to understand work being done and how efficient a working group is. Not necessary for SWG DWG
- Jenny: Provide necessary support to CWG for the CRT Release and YPP payments takeover from JSG
- Jenny: Review/assess Q1 2024 OKRs
- Dmitry: Consider offering role of council sec to Tomato (DM)
- Dmitry: Continue working on the Finance Spreadsheet - finalize WG individual sheets for aggregation of council plans and work with Giants on Dashboard tabs (DM)
- Vikan: Consider hiring an external marketing agency to promote the Creator token, the MWG is doing a great job but we are limited to the web3 space and we need to reach the creators outside the web3 space and I think the CRT is too big for the experimental marketing we’ve been doing, we could hire an agency for a month and reassess their results and the MWG could build off of their results
