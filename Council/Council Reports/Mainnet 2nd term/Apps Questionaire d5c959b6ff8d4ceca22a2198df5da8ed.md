# How does Gleev count video views?

# Does Gleev have any protection against manipulating video counts using bots and scripts?

# Does Gleev provide any insights into what part of the video gets the most viewers' attention?

# Do you think it's feasible and appropriate to integrate video ads into Gleev/Atlas?

# Is it possible to have DRM-protected content on Gleev/Atlas? (Think Coursera, or Udemy video courses)

# In its current state, how can Gleev be used to generate revenue by a video blogger, other than by selling video NTFs and soliciting donations?

# Can Gleev video NFTs be listed on other NFT platforms?

# Do you have any suggestion on why would a content creator want to issue their creator tokens?

# Can you propose a way to protect Gleev-like apps from spam uploads?

# How feasible would it be to add a support for live video streaming?

# Gleev seems to be lacking the basic end-user features: watch history, "Save to watch later", looped playback. How feasible is to add these in the reference implementation?
