Has been discussed but not clear on direction just yet. Requires follow up. | In progress |

## 5**. WGs’ Status**

**Legends**:
*🟢 Completed*

*🟡 Started but not completed / WIP*

*🔴 No work was done or not achieved*

### **Builders WG**

Lead: **klaudiusz**
[Plan](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/62?post=6559) **- [Report](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/15?post=6778)**

### Bring Argo bridge to usable state and deploy to Base. Work with the council on creating procedures and wider deployment plan.

🟢 We have not deployed to Base, but we have a deployment on Base Sepolia testnet. We are working with JSG to finalize designs for the bridge app. The app also now supports all multisig operations. Council has passed a proposal for Argo parameters based on calls we’ve had.

### Review and ship pending Argus&Colossus features.

🟡 We’ve made some progress on nodes maintenance feature but have not shipped it or the S3 support. For S3 we’re blocked by review from JSG, they have claimed multiple times they will do it but that has not materialized. I’m hoping it happens next term, if not, we will take care of it after bridge work is finished.

### Ship Metamask support in Pioneer and Atlas.

🟡 We have shipped support in Pioneer, Atlas PR is still waiting for a review.

### Ship improvements to council report tool (CRT stats).

### *🟢* **CRT updates**

Design on this topic is fully completed, Development of Discovery page is on second round of qa:

Here's the remaining effort after testing today:

[https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6408#issuecomment-2213787142](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/6408#issuecomment-2213787142)

Here's preview branch (choose Dev env from adming panel to view data)

[https://atlas-7ndjwl1oc-joystream.vercel.app/crt-marketplace?currentPage=0&perPage=10&orderBy=priceChange_DESC](https://atlas-7ndjwl1oc-joystream.vercel.app/crt-marketplace?currentPage=0&perPage=10&orderBy=priceChange_DESC)

### *🟢* **Categories**

QA passed, we just need to add analytics events there before can release

Preview branch is here: [https://atlas-flqtr0hsd-joystream.vercel.app/](https://atlas-flqtr0hsd-joystream.vercel.app/)

It already has language from browser filtering incorporated. We are discussing with Bedeho whether to expand the list of options and I am awaiting for instructions on how to analyse channel and videos count within each category before the list can be finaslised. I also think we can release the current version and add more categories as we go, including the "memes" category suggested by 0x2bc previously.

*🟡* **Key onboarding improvements**: Scoped for Design, design not started.

*🟡* **NFT redesign** - still in the backlog

*🟡* **Competitive feature mapping** - not started, but also not part of the OKRs. Unsure how this would impact our performance over next few months.
