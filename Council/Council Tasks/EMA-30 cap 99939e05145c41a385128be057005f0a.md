### Background

The EMA-30 budget system was introduced in late September 2023 ( [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/551](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/551) ) and is basically the way the DAO correlates its spending to market conditions. An EMA-30 rate is used each term to compose budgets by each WG.

Since EMA-30 was introduced we have been through several market swings and begun paying leads with market rate salaries that are placed in vesting schedules and the token price has been erratic. Simply put the EMA-30 pricing tool highly impacts budgets and subsequently inflation.

**NOTE:**

- The below table is somewhat skewed because sometimes payments aren’t made in the term they are supposed to be)
- It only includes WG spending since things like validator rewards and creator rewards do not really fall under the EMA-30 system

| **Council Term** | **Source** | **Starting Date** | **EMA-30 rate (USD/JOY)** | **WG spending ($JOY)** | **WG spending (USD)** | **Inflation (% for individual term)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31 | [**Plan**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/845) | 14th March 2024 | 0.022 | 3,130,135 $JOY | $68,862 | 0.412% |
| 32 | [**Plan**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/861) | 11th April 2024 | 0.021 | 3,657,016 | $76,797 | 0.602% |
| 33 | [**Plan**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/887) | 9th May 2024 | 0.015 | 4,481,878 | $67,228 | 0.630% |
| 34 | [**Plan**](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/913) | 6th June 2024 | 0.012 | 4,561,230 | $54,735 | 0.674% |

### Problem

- **The lower the EMA-30 rate goes, the higher inflation goes**
- **Many of the larger spends of the DAO go into vesting schedules, which means that the value of the EMA-30 rate is not very attached to what the market may be when the vesting schedule fully matures. (it could be better/worse, it is impossible to say)**
- **At some point it will likely become untenable to have the EMA-30 rate go below a certain rate.**

This depends on the role (I believe CDN/infrastructure needs to be a separate discussion) but we need to have controls in place to try and control inflation.

### Solution

I believe we need to propose a floor/limit for EMA-30 rates, particularly for lead roles or high paying roles that go into vesting schedules.

To start the discussion I will propose **$0.011/JOY**

**If proposed and approved, this would mean that the EMA-30 rate will have a floor rate of $0.01 in the event of adverse market conditions. (This could be changed by a future proposal)**
