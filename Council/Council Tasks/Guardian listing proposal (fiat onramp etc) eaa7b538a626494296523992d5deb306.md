Dmitry was contacted by this company and it seems like a very interesting proposal. We currently lack fiat on-ramp and this would provide credit card purchases etc.

**Proposition from Guardian**

1) Extensive Partner Network: Ability to have JOY available on our 400+ partner platforms such as CoinEx, Ledger, ChangeNow, Guarda ensuring maximum exposure and reach.
2) Enable Swaps: Allow your users to exchange JOY for over 450 cryptocurrencies.
3) Global Access: JOY will be available in 40+ different FIATs worldwide via Mastercard/Visa/SEPA/Google and Apple Pay/Revolut Pay.
