# Background

YPP (YouTube Partner Program) is a growth initiative for Joystream. It allows creators to sync their channel’s content to Joystream on a continuous basis and creators are rewarded with $JOY tokens based upon grading of their channel. It is the key growth program for Joystream currently.

Jsgenesis started this initiative and handled it to begin with and gradually the DAO has taken over many parts of this program including the grading of channels, customer support and other activities while JSG has up until now paid the associated rewards for this program from accounts that they control. This means the tokens for this program were not newly minted by the DAO and were not a part of typical inflation calculations.

# Proposal

- Jsgenesis has indicated that they would like for the DAO to take over the payment part of the YPP program which would essentially make it completely controlled by the DAO.
- There has been some discussion and interest in potentially changing the nature of scope of these payments by the DAO, however for operational purposes this will not be discussed at this point and this proposal will be dealing with the DAO taking over the payments involved without changing the payout amounts of nature of them at this point in time. If and when this proposal is accepted and implemented by the DAO, there may be value in having a discussion about adjusting the reward parameters, but this should only occur once the handover has actually occured.
- Unlike how most of the DAO’s payments are handled, which are calculated using an EMA-30 based exchange rate, YPP is paid out using the spot rate. It does not seem like it would be in the DAO’s best interest to deviate from this since it would be highly confusing to communicate to normal users about EMA-30. It is important to note this, since
- There is also an account that pays the associated fees for uploading content to Joystream (called the “YT-Synch Collaborator). These fees are not believed to be very substantial and really just require monitoring and periodically topping up. These fees are basically burned, so are quite similar in nature to membership faucet fees. It is unclear what the amount of these fees is.
- Jsgenesis also pays for some web2 services that are associated with the YPP program, but there is no discussion yet of the DAO taking over these parts. For now discussion of this aspect is out of scope of this pre-proposal.
- The DAO already handles all of the grading and other operational aspects of the program via the Content Curator WG.

# Requirements for DAO to figure out

1. Budget + inflation considerations. If the DAO will be paying out these amounts they must be factored into our current budgets as well as the council’s budget increment and handled appropriately. They are not paid once per council term like most of our budget is, nor are they paid at the EMA-30 rate. They are difficult to plan for because the growth of the program can be unpredictable.
2. Handling of payments. These payments should be handled by the Content Curator Working Group
3. Planning and reporting of payments
4. Oversight and limitations of payouts

## Historical Payments

This table is to show what payments were made in the few most recent YPP payouts so that the council can be aware of the financial obligations of this. This table only shows the last 6 sets of payouts which covers 6 weeks. These payouts include signup rewards, referral rewards, sync rewards.

The source of data for this table can be found on our Notion and is called “YouTube Creator Payouts”: [https://www.notion.so/joystream/YouTube-Creator-Payouts-02f7cf50972145bfb64c8543914ae4bb](https://www.notion.so/YouTube-Creator-Payouts-02f7cf50972145bfb64c8543914ae4bb?pvs=21)
