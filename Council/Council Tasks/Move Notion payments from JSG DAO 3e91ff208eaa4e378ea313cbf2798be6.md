- Currently, to add new members to Notion contact and approval must go through JSG which slows down things considerably
- The DAO is moving towards more heavily using Notion for productivity/management & alignment between the various parties involved, it is necessary for the DAO to begin paying for this tool to ensure it can be used as much as possible
- It currently costs ~$150/month, more/less users impacts the pricing of it.
