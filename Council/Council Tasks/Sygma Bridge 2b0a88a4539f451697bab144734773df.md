- Per Klaudiusz there may be a significant cost involved (~$60k USD/year). Terms still need to be discussed more fully.
- Contract must also be involved—is good for DAO because it gives us some form of protection for some security/guarantee issues.
- Klaudiusz will provide an update when he gets one. DAO needs to get a better understanding of financial side, what it includes/excludes, payment terms (12 months upfront or monthly), whether it can be paid in stables or bank transfer etc
- DAO needs to understand timeframe of execution for contract etc and also whether to build up stablecoin treasury in advance/coordination to achieve this.
- cost/benefit analysis is needed, bedeho suggested that it *may* be an option to look at the community bridge first for now and then maybe reconsider the Sygma bridge at some point later
    - Benefit of sygma bridge is that it is automated/less security risk

- A meeting was held on Discord and the general consensus seems to be that we will be going with a community bridge
