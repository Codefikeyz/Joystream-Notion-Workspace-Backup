Much has been said about market conditions and inflation recently and I think a lot of it is based either on misunderstanding or the fact that the DAO has been doing a poor job of communicating its concepts of budgets, vesting and inflation so far—there is very much a vacuum of information in this area and I feel that it is important to address. 

There are obviously also some concerns about spending and inflation in general and the DAO/council are already working hard on research and understanding the impact of vesting schedules as well as working on some measures to help—there are some costs already being cut.

In particular I wanted to address the concerns that were shown in a recent screenshot of some conversation that was shared that complained that the DAO is paying people too much—I am going to address these concerns because I think they are misguided and do not take into account the nature of vesting schedules, nor do they understand the reality of the project.

I also want to say, in the most polite possible terms, that unless you are actively in the Discord *and* reading the forum *and* also following our main 5-10 Github repos then having strong opinions about things like DAO spending is of little value—but I cannot really blame people because our project is complex and keeping up to date with progress is a full time job in itself. If you participated in the project in some way in the past and no longer do because of whatever reason—please understand the DAO is working on the “now”.

I also feel like we need a dedicated website expressly for this purpose in the near future because getting these figures is a total time consuming pain in the ass and I could be working on other more important things right now (look at the council kanban board for an idea of how many other things there are to work on: [https://joystream.notion.site/d0b1c51337c3405aa5a471bbbaa11d63?v=c341e481080e4b8ca8511cbd8ab390d0&pvs=4](../Council%20Tasks%20d0b1c51337c3405aa5a471bbbaa11d63.md) — researching and writing this post is part of one of those tasks and it has taken me an extreme amount of time to gather the relevant figures. There should be an easier way of accessing this information.

Here are some facts:

- Joystream’s token supply is about 87% unlocked, this means there are about 926.55 million unlocked $JOY. I have done quite a lot of analysis of transactions surrounding recent market activity, and they all come from a wide variety of sources and the amounts at play are really representative of the DAO’s current spending or inflation.
    - This means that the DAO’s spending has a minimal impact compared to the amount of $JOY that is already unlocked from when the project was launched—in total, since launch, the DAO has only contributed about 6.1% to that amount over a year and a half.
- The DAO itself has not received any money from VC/investors. It operates entirely on $JOY and a small stablecoin treasury that was built from selling on the market when the price was higher. Some people seem to think that the people working on the DAO are getting paid by investors but this is not the case.
- From Joystream’s launch until today (18 months):
    - Issuance has increased from 1bn > 1.065bn
    - This means that 65m $JOY have been issued since launch
    - This is 6.5% inflation over 18 months (this is not that high of a figure for an early stage project with a scope like ours)
    - or, about 0.527% inflation per month
- In the most recent council plan ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/913](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/913))
    - The council approved a planned 4.4m $JOY spending across all WGs
    - of this, 51.57% or 2,351,715 $JOY went to lead salaries—**ALL** lead salaries are paid into 1 or 2 year vesting schedules
        - The total amount of $JOY that gets unlocked for all lead salaries, for the past 4 council terms combined is **15,988 $JOY per day or 447,664 $JOY per 28 day council term** (this even includes the current council term)
        - This amount is quite minimal and I think there is a vast misunderstanding about these vesting schedules existing and their impact on the market.
    - The council is actively looking into moving more WG spending into vesting schedules, as can be seen in this pre-proposal to try and minimize the immediate market impact of salaries: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/933](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/933) (however, there is some % of spending that must be paid directly for costs)

In general, although there have been some complaints about DAO spending we are extremely lucky to have some brilliant people working hard on many aspects of the DAO and who are capable of delivering things like runtime upgrades and other vital things for the project. Their salaries are representative of the level of involvement and dedication they have to the project and increase the vested interest they have in ensuring it’s success.

They are ***critical*** to being able to deliver on our roadmap: [https://www.joystream.org/roadmap?filename=2024 v3](https://www.joystream.org/roadmap?filename=2024%20v3) and anyone who isn’t actively contributing to the project and sitting and complaining about these things simply does not understand things.
