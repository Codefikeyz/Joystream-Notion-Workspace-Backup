Thank you for this video, I got some time (finally) to go through it and here is my feedback. In general, I do appreciate some of the points you have made but I kind of think the idea of converting Joystream from a video platform into entirely a bounty board isn’t really viable nor what the project is about—I know people make a lot of analogies to YouTube as it is the incumbent in the space, but I feel our current concept of being a video platform is a viable one and even though we still have a lot of work to do, there is space within video for our offering.

- Inflow/outflow
    - While the topic your brought up about inflow vs outflow is somewhat accurate, it doesn’t really account for the fact that our token is ~90% unlocked. If we were like 90% locked and were really at a fine line between cost/profit it would make a lot more sense and be more possible to focus on this area closely. That doesn’t diminish the importance of it achieving balance in the long term—I just think it means that for now we are best suited to focus on our roadmap and long term goals and delivery, we have to make a compelling argument for the 90% of “holders” to hold and show a future in the project.
- Premium features/subscriptions/memberships
    - I think the end goal is to have these features but we’re not yet in a position where we can meaningfully implement these features. I would say we are still in the early stages of growth/development and making sure the UX/UI for creators/viewers is still a key area of improvement as well as growing our content library and also having creators that actually use the CRT functionality etc. We onboarded a lot of creators before the CRT feature was actually deployed and few of them meaningfully engaged on our Discord etc or even within Gleev, the creator WG has been working hard at changing that but it will take time to see results.
- Joystream Awareness
    - I know you said you disagree with this, which is fine but you have focused mostly on Gleev as the product in your video. The Joystream DAO is also a product and when I say “Joystream awareness” I am more referring to people within crypto being aware of us as a crypto project (before being an actual video platform)—I know that may seem counterintuitive but have people within web3 talking about the unique features of our DAO is a distinguishing thing to achieve and I believe can impact the market more immediately and more substantially than Gleev in the immediate future. Longer term, it obviously makes sense to focus as much as we can on Gleev. This “awareness” issue obviously also correlates to Gleev, but my take on this issue is that Joystream itself has an awareness issue.
- Onboarding bonuses (for connecting channels etc)
    - I think the key part with these initiatives is that they are supposed (and are starting to) to create creator engagement, where people don’t just sign up and “do nothing” which we experienced previously. I mentioned it in the “premium features” bullet point above.
- Creators
    - I know you mentioned views/attention quite a bit but it seemed like a lot of your focus was on creators who are purely looking to earn—this is a vast industry and I get why the idea of Joystream is appealing to some for this.
    - But my own personal “thing” is that we need to bring creators who are making content because they want to, this is kind of a critical/pivotal objective for any social media platform because if its 100% people who just want to earn the content can tend to not be appealing for people to watch. Obviously there are some challenges with this given the nature of our platform and tokens etc and the fact we focus on near-term rewards but I would hope that we start to get into a position where we get creators who make videos and then “maybe” get a reward if the viewers/market likes it.
    - Psychologically, I think there is a vast difference in the type of content that people make if they “know” they are going to get a reward vs just doing it for fun and maybe getting a reward. This is not easy to achieve though and it is hard for creators to “fit in” on Gleev when as you mentioned the offering of content isn’t very directed/established just yet.
- Bounties board
    - I do like this idea and we have some functionality that kind of can work towards this, however, this space is already tremendously noisy and overcrowded. It seems very appealing but building our project’s reputation to a point where we can attract decent bounties is a very non-trivial task.
- Inflation/spending etc
    - I made a post addressing inflation in quite some detail: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/935](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/935) - there are already some discussions about cutting costs and managing inflation outside of this thread also.
- “Get rid of paid counsel”
    - This has been proposed previously and was rejected. I think it vastly diminishes the amount of responsibility and workload that the council has. This is a very contentious topic already and it has taken 1.5 years for the council salary to be adjusted even a single time.
- “Get rid of every WG”
    - I do not think this would work and wasn’t the way Joystream was designed. There are other projects that work on this kind of model. I think it kind of devalues the amount of work that goes into maintaining a platform, infrastructure etc
- Replace the whole of Gleev with a bounty/job board
    - I really do not think this has any viability for the project. There are thousands of projects already that do the kind of bounty board system that you are suggesting. Beyond this there are hundreds of crypto projects that did the same thing and it is very much not trivial to make something like this a success. I think your proposal also escapes how difficult it is to actually bring substantial creators onboard and to do things like quality control.
- Markets/exchanges
    - I kind of agree with your sentiment here. I don’t know much about exchanges or exchange strategy though.
