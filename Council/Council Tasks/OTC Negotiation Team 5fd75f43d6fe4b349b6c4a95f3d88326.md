Consider assigning a set of trusted community members to engage in OTC deal negotiation as it appears that the people trying to negotiate with the DAO are uncomfortable doing this publicly (there is no current forum thread for this)

## Brief

Consider assigning a set of trusted community members to engage in OTC deal negotiation as it appears that the people trying to negotiate with the DAO are uncomfortable doing this via our currently defined/agreed upon routes of doing so.

## Background

- OTC deals, in the context of this proposal are either individual or corporate investors who engage in a deal with "the DAO" to purchase tokens based on some agreed upon price, vesting schedule and whatever other terms are applicable.
- The DAO may wish to do this for several reasons, chiefly among those is to increase the size of the stablecoin treasury which can ensure there are long term finances available for the DAO to utilize and to be less reliant on the market performance of the project's native token ($JOY). It also can enable the DAO to pay for certain 3rd party expenses which can **only** be paid in stablecoins.
- Historically, the DAO has been approached a few times by outside entities who wish to partake in an OTC deal... however, while we have an agreed upon method for this to take place, it currently places the onus on the initiator (the "buyer") to create a pre-proposal and take some predefined action. It has been shown that "buyers" have historically been reluctant to embark on this first step. It appears that expecting them to get involved with our governance system has been unsuccessful so far so perhaps it is time to outline a new process.
- Therefore, a new approach is perhaps required that I will outline below. It would simply be an elected body of long term, well regarded community members/DAO employees to negotiate with "buyers" and to communicate with the council/DAO about the prospects and terms of any such a deal.
- It should be noted that I (tomato) have no interest in being a part of this "OTC team" committee.

- [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/574](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/574) -`OTC Guide` - an approved proposal

## Proposal

1. [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/574](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/574) - `OTC Guide` is replaced/superceeded by a new proposal.
2. The new proposal would stipulate new terms for OTC transactions to be presented to the council.
3. Some subset of DAO employees/community members would be elected via a separate proposal to act as "negotiators" on behalf of the DAO (called the "OTC Team").
4. There may be some reward stipulated for the "OTC Team". This could be in the form of a flat rate or a "% bonus" of any successful deal.
5. The DAO could also allow for a "% bonus" to anyone who refers a "buyer" to the DAO who successfully comes to an agreement for an OTC purchase.
6. Any members of this elected committee ("OTC Team") would be expected to abstain or refrain from being involved is there is any possibility of a conflict of interest. This could include reasons such as being on the currently elected council or that such as the funding resulting from a successful OTC deal being reached financially benefiting them in some substantial way.
7. Any members of the elected committee ("OTC Team") would be expected to have the best interests of the DAO at hand.
8. They would be expected to communicate with outside "buyers" in a private group chat (or similar) and come to some shared agreement on what a deal may look like.
9. They would then create the necessary pre-proposals and approach the current elected council with the terms involved with such a deal.
10. The council would then discuss with the "OTC Team" and any counterparties (if appropriate) to negotiate, refine and agree upon the terms of any such deal.
