- Validator module for Pioneer is done but still requires copy/pasting addresses into polkadot.js website.
- It seems many users who want to stake are still very confused by the setup based on the questions they are asking

- [ ]  Builders WG need to communicate on cost/reality/timeline of prioritizing the nominator dashboard in Pioneer
- Per klaudiusz (update on march 18) it is possible, but needs a timeline.

- [ ]  Council also need to discuss this and decide whether it should be raised in priority as a short term goal
- [ ]  Budget for tutorial creation (perhaps get ambassadors involved)
