## Draft

Membership controller account: `j4WqoWXRjQwy5ZurNFMJ89nq6UMEiVvByze35FUEHu4BDan2C`

Membership handle: `JCBF` / [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/members/3341](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/members/3341) 

Channel name: `JCBF` / [https://gleev.xyz/channel/64194](https://gleev.xyz/channel/64194)

Channel revenue account: `j4To6jgKfy8MgiMRDXzc15ggN8AnFBeLm9hTk4L5sCu1BioAd`

## Funding

- A 4 month commitment from the council
- 166k initial bootstrap funding, with no vesting schedule to the membership controller account
    - this will **not** go into the revenue account
    - to be paid via a funding proposal
- 100k per council term paid to a staked worker in some working group
    - worker will be `tomato` and reward account will be `Channel revenue account`
    - stake will be `150k $JOY`

## CRT parameters

- CRT Name: `JCBF`
- revenue split:
    - 70/30 (70 goes towards community building spending, 30 goes towards people who hold CRT tokens
- channel reward / inflation:
    - 14%
        - This is a high amount, but allows the channel to eventually become self sustaining—excess tokens can be burned. gifted etc and also the inflation amount can be lowered permanently (it cannot be raised)
- channel tokens initial supply:
    - 1,000
- Token unlock schedule
    - Fully locked period / cliff
        - 3 months - this means that the channel owner will not be able to sell any of the tokens for this time period
    - vesting period
        - 6 months - this means that after 9 months the supply will be fully unlocked (taking into consideration the fully locked period
    - first payout
        - 10% - this means that 10% of the supply would unlock to the “owner” after the fully locked period and be sellable on the market
        

This idea for the JCBF was first presented almost an entire year ago ( [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/734?post=5578](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/734?post=5578) ). The JCBF is a mechanism for the DAO to invest in CRTs and NFTs and is fully described in the pre-proposal thread here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/911](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/911)

It has been discussed to death and rejected several times at this point. It could be said that more time, energy and resources have been spent on rejecting this idea at this point that far outweigh what it would have cost to just try with. It is an experiment for our DAO and results are not guaranteed—it seems that people want guaranteed results and some sort of meticulously engineered gameplan, when this simply does not work for community building. No one else has to date presented any experiment like it, nor spent the amount of time trying to get something like this to pass and the Joystream project is in dire need of experiments like these to happen and to happen without several hundred pages of policies and procedures before things can happen.

There is now a pressing need for the JCBF (it was called DCBF previously) to exist to help build activity within the CRT marketplace plus there are some other opportunities that may arise related to the fund.
