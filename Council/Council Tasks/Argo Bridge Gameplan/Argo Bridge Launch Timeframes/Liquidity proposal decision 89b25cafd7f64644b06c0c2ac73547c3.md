# Liquidity proposal / decision

C/O: Council, liquidity
Date: July 5, 2024
Text: - needs to be 2 weeks before AMM launch

A week before 4th July 2024

- USDT Target:
    - 20-50k USD
        - leet_joy + klaudiusz in agreement about this
    - We can likely start with less than this
    - Should start with small steps for this
- JOY Target:
    - Council treasury contains 15m $JOY
    - Per klaudiusz should be the same amount worth of $JOY
    - 2-5m $JOY

Questions

- Can we incentivize community to provide USDT liquidity?
    - *or,* can we do an OTC deal
- Uniswap v2 vs v3

Stablecoin treasury:

- We have 31k USDT
- We have an “up to” 11k obligation to Tangem (depending on amount of wallets sold)
    - 149-178 wallets @ $63 USD each = $9387 USD - $11,214 USD
- We are going to be paying SWG+DWG (obligation is around 3k USD per month)
    - $2094 for storage server costs
    - $859 for dist server costs
    - total = $2953 USD
    - If we assume 3 x months for this, that is $8859 USD
- **This leaves about $10,927 USD usable from stablecoin treasury for liquidity**
- We need about $15k USDT in stablecoin treasury extra (about 1.5m $JOY)
    - MWG has about 3k USDT that can potentially be used (around 2-4k USDT)
    - Would need to be by about July 19th

Notes

- Low liquidity = major price jumps / less attraction to use AMM
- Low liquidity can enable attacks against order book
- We can lose the liquidity we provide in USDT (high risk)

4th July, 2024

- 0x2bc
    - We could launch with 10k USDT
    - We could launch liquidity incentives/APY program post-bridge launch if we see enough demand for the wrapped $JOY token
- bedeho
    - The need for liquidity might not be as pressing as stated
    - If someone is willing to borrow USDT from JSG (e.g. interest rate, agreement needed etc)—lots of particulars need to be discussed here
- DAO/council
    - Need to decide on value proposition of having more liquidity vs less on launch
        - At the current state we will be launching with ~10k USDT, is that a dealbreaker?
