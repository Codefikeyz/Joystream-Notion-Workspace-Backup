# Arbitrage/MM/bot Research / Decision

C/O: Council, People who know about this stuff

- Look into hummingbot
    - strategies for uniswap v2 vs v3
- Should ask JSG to look into this as they are MM (0x2bc)
    - Klaudiusz to ask JSG about this (27th June)
- per leet_joy we should perhaps have a tutorial as it can be profitable

7th July, 2024

- JSG will not do arbitrage but can perhaps assist with infrastructure
- Testing should have started a month ago per Klaudiusz, any random pair can be used for this purpose
- leet_joy may be able to do this
- mrbovo may be able to do this
