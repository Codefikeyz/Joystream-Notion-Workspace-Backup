# DEX/AMM Launches

C/O: Builders, People who know about this stuff
Date: July 19, 2024
Text: - needs review of smart contracts, takes about a day

- Uniswap v2 vs v3
    - leet_joy
        - pretty similar in terms of volume/listings
    - dmitry
        - v3 can provide more liquidity with less funds, but more exposure to impermanent loss + higher price impacts with volatiility
        - suggests to start with v3
        - we should go with uniswap as it has an app, brand name etc, start with a humble price setup and see how it goes
- aerodrome
    - suggested by FM, can probably get listed
    - some info, MCLB is the largest stakeholder in AERO and they need a minimum total of 1% veAERO to approve your listing (Which MCLB exceeds alone)
    Lmk if you want help in comms with their team (Also I highly recommend to study the bribing flywheel where JOY DAO can host POL and actually get rewards for it)
    Base onchain summer is literally just starting so I highly recommend to get this started ASAP to reap maximum benefits!
        - [https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/aerodrome](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/aerodrome)
    - leet_joy in contact with team trying to get more info and details (4th July, 2024)
- velodrome
    - fork of aerodrome
    - has less volume than aerodrome

Questions:

- who will be people involved in adding liquidity to LP
    - cannot be done by safe wallet perhaps because its a smart contract (per leet_joy)
    - DAO might have to send liquidity to an individual person as counterparty to put liquidity in
-
