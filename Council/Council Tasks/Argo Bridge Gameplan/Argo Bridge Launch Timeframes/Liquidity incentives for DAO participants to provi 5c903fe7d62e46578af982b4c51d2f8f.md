- leet_joy
    - 1st way
        - they send from their own wallet, risks for the DAO, would need to provide $JOY
    - 2nd way
        - they send to the council/multisig
        - in return they get an incentive on top of USDT
            - this would be wrapped $JOY on BASE side
    - risks
        - if joy drops, then when cashing out council will be getting less USDT / more JOY
        - council would have to sell JOY
    - leet_joy to make a pre-proposal
