# LP initiative (promo) research

C/O: Council, Marketing, People who know about this stuff, liquidity

A week before 4th July, 2024

Questions:

- Do we need to do this on launch?
    - leet_joy + 0x2bc seem to think we don’t need to do this on launch
- Who knows about this stuff?
    - 0x2bc + yyagi
        - 0x2bc to do some research
- What incentives could we offer?
    - 0x2bc: 500% APY would be a good offer
        - was the same offer on zerolayer on uniswap
        - 
- How much would the incentives cost?
- Are there any tools/platforms we could use to simplify this from our side?

- 0x2bc
    - Assume 50k USDT @ 500% APY = ballpark figure for council treasury obligation (in $JOY)
- bedeho
    - if someone provides 10K USDT, and you pay 500% APY, this means you would have to pay them 50K USD worth of JOY if it was for on eyear, or at current prices 5M JOY? how can this make sense economically. even if you dont do it a full your, just 25% of a year, this totally breaks with almost right away it seems
- leet_joy
    - lots of risks, not much sense long term, may be low volume
