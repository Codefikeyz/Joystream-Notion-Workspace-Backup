- [ ]  DAO needs to take ownership of YPP parameters, such as table below

```
There are limits on the synced videos size and count:

- Max of 100 videos OR 10 GB for channel with <5k YT subscribers count
- Max of 250 videos OR 100 GB for channel with < 50k YT subscribers count
- Max of 1000 videos OR 1 TB  for channel with >50k YT subscribers count
- For any channel max size of a single synced video is 15 GB
- For any channel max duration of synced video is 3 hrs
```

- [ ]  What other parameters are there?
- [ ]  Draft a pre-proposal that includes all YPP parameters, such that they can be updated in the future with a single signal proposal

| Tier | Sign up | Sync Per Video | Referral Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 2 | 0 | x |
| Silver | 50 | 3 | x |
| Gold | 100 | 5 | x |
| Diamond | 200 | 16 | x |

## Background

- YPP (YouTube Partner Program) is a way for creators to sign onto Joystream via Gleev (our primary user-facing video app). This program has been in operation for approximately a year [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/210](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/210)
- YPP payouts are currently being done by JSG, but the YPP program itself is mostly managed by the DAO. It is planned that YPP payments will soon will be taken over by the DAO ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/887](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/887)). This pre-proposal has not reached the proposal/voting stage just yet but it seems likely that it would be approved when it is. It should be noted that this pre-proposal *only* deals with the DAO managing payouts (the Content WG would be the responsible party).
- It had previously been discussed many months ago about the DAO taking over the parameters of the YPP program ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/483?post=4169](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/483?post=4169)). This would, in effect allow the DAO/governance to periodically adjust the payout amounts to each tier (in the form of signup bonuses, sync per video rewards etc)

## Proposal

- Create a proposal for the DAO to take control of the *parameters* for YPP payouts, these currently look like this:
    
    
    | Tier | Sign up | Sync Per Video | Referral Bonus |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Bronze | 2 | 0 | x |
    | Silver | 50 | 3 | x |
    | Gold | 100 | 5 | x |
    | Diamond | 200 | 16 | x |
- Also included in this proposal should be a breakdown of “sync limits” which are currently as follows—note: it may be desirable to have this as a separate proposal
    - There are limits on the synced videos size and count:
    - Max of 100 videos OR 10 GB for channel with <5k YT subscribers count
    - Max of 250 videos OR 100 GB for channel with < 50k YT subscribers count
    - Max of 1000 videos OR 1 TB  for channel with >50k YT subscribers count
    - For any channel max size of a single synced video is 15 GB
    - For any channel max duration of synced video is 3 hrs
- Are there any other parameters that should be considered here?

## Notes

- The proposal should be formatted in such a way that it is basically a *template* and the council or a proposer can easily create a new version of the proposal, which supersedes the previous one to update the parameters
- The proposal should perhaps identify some hardcoded limits about how much can be spent within a given timeframe
- The proposal should ideally identify the mechanism by which YPP payouts are dealt with (for instance, this may take the form of a separate budget proposal for the `Content WG` that specifically deals with YPP payouts—this is kind of important for accounting purposes as well as budget planning and combining YPP payouts with salaries for `Content WG` workers is quite difficult to deal with from an accounting perspective)—this may already be dealt with by the following pre-proposal once it reaches the proposal stage: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/887](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/887)
- The proposal should perhaps also allow some autonomy for the `Content WG Lead` to change things if we suddenly get very many signups in a short amount of time or some other emergency budget or operational constraints are reached.
- Although some may argue that it isn’t necessary to have such a proposal, the council are the decision makers and need to look at not only the immediate financial concerns and benefits of YPP rewards (which go through the `Curator WG`) but also consider concerns about storage/CDN load (which come from the `Storage WG` and the `Distribution WG`) and may also need to look at much longer term financial questions (which may come from the `Treasurer` role—which does not exist just yet)

CWGL has indicated an imminent change to sync rewards might be due, so have placed this on hold for now
