A community member provided this which they generated from chatgpt:

```
Size of the source video (ingested at 1080p).
Number of videos to transcode.
Number of output formats (1080p, 720p, and 480p).
Transcoding cost per hour.
Let's break it down for each scenario:

1 x 10-minute video:

Source video size: 3-4GB
Number of output formats: 3
Total minutes to transcode: 10 minutes x 3 output formats = 30 minutes
Cost: (30 minutes / 60) x $0.03 = $0.015
100 x 10-minute videos:

Total minutes to transcode: 100 x 10 minutes x 3 output formats = 3000 minutes
Cost: (3000 minutes / 60) x $0.03 = $1.50
1000 x 10-minute videos:

Total minutes to transcode: 1000 x 10 minutes x 3 output formats = 30000 minutes
Cost: (30000 minutes / 60) x $0.03 = $15.00
100,000 x 10-minute videos:

Total minutes to transcode: 100000 x 10 minutes x 3 output formats = 3000000 minutes
Cost: (3000000 minutes / 60) x $0.03 = $1500.00
These are approximate costs based on the given transcoding rate and the number of videos and formats specified. Actual costs may vary depending on additional factors and any specific requirements.
