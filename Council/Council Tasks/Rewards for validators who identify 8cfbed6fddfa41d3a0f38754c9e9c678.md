## Problem

We now have a shiny new Validator dashboard, but it has been challenging to get validators to identify their validators. To do this they just need to edit their Pioneer membership and attach their validator addresses to it. This is very easy to do within Pioneer.

- Some users may not want to do this for reasons of privacy
- Some users may not be aware that they can do it (I have made announcements a few times on Discord/Telegram regarding it)
- Some users may be lazy

The advantages of having identified validators are numerous, and can particularly help with:

- Having a higher quality list of validators which nominators can choose to validate against
- Having validators that are more proactively involved with the community
- Us being able to reach out to validators to ensure they are upgraded or aware of upcoming system events that are relevant to them

The current status of validator identities:

| **Identified** | **Unidentified** |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | 29 |

## Solution

It has been discussed that there could be a financial reward for validators that identify. I think this should be a blanket reward that goes to all previously identified validators for the sake of simplicity.

I would recommend a reward of $25 worth of $JOY at the spot rate, to be paid via spending proposals. This would be a cost of $1,125 assuming that *all* validators identified.

The reward being discussed here can help to achieve a few things:

- Getting validators to take the time out of their day to identify
- Getting validators to start being more involved, we have had some dissatisfied validators when it comes to rewards, so the financial bonus may be a nice thing for them
