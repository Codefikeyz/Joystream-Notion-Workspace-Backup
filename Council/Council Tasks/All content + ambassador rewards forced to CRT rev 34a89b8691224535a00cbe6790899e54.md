## Background

Creator tokens are very easily one of Joystream’s key unique features and possible inflection points. They offer a unique and interesting way for both creators, viewers and potential “investors” to partake in the ecosystem without having to understand all of the “complex DAO stuff”.

CRTs in the context of this pre-proposal offer two forms of incentives and interest to their creators and users and before going further it is really critical to highly the differences between them:

- DAO rewards/incentives
    - Creator: ”I just received a reward from the DAO because its Tuesday, just like I did last Tuesday”
    - Users: “Why do I care?”
    - These are *very* *predictable* and *very* *boring*
        - They are **done at most once per week or even less**
        - They almost **never happen on weekends or outside of office hours**
        - They **can only be done by DAO WGs or Leads**
        - They are generally for **predictable amounts**
- CRT market activity/investors
    - Creator: “3 people just bought my CRT in the past hour!”
    - Users: “Wow, this channel seems to have decent revenue and its price is climbing/crashing, this looks interesting! I want to refresh the page. What type of content do they make?”
    - These are ***unpredictable*** and ***exciting***
        - They can be done at almost any time by anyone
        - The amounts and nature of these are highly unpredictable

Part of Joystream’s Q3 OKRs ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/936](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/936)) includes many goals of increasing user interest and attention on the platform, and by the DAO fully embracing the unpredictable and perhaps volatile nature of what the CRT market *could* be, we could greatly improve things and also possibly induce more outside participants to partake on the platform.

## Problem

We currently payout two broad groups of “users” (non-workers) on Joystream:

- Ambassadors
- Content creators (YPP and other forms of rewards)

The problem is that unless the rewards for these go into a CRT/revenue share account then there is basically no incentive for creators to:

- set up a CRT
- “pay attention” to it (i.e. making sure to periodically do revenue shares, closing revenue shares etc)
- advertise them, make them interesting
- take an actual interest in their CRT’s success or pay attention to it

It is far too easy for creators in particular to not have to use one of the core functions of the platform (CRTs) and just receive the rewards that the DAO is paying them directly—and this means they do not actually have to “interface” with Gleev/Joystream regularly at all in some cases or really have any care or attention to the platform’s success.

This is also a problem because it means that the amount of CRTs available are either limited or unappealing and it seems like a totally missed opportunity (granted, the CRT function did not launch until relatively recently). We should be aiming to have as many CRTs that are as interesting as possible and also a CRT marketplace that is reactive to how much the DAO is paying them—and visitors to the CRT section should be finding an enticing, broad array of available CRTs that are actually active.

Currently the selection of CRTs is quite limited and not enticing enough and it should very much be realized that by forcing these payouts to go into CRTs it is a investment not only in creators and ambassadors but the CRT function itself.

The success of the CRT feature also rides on it being marketable to the outside world, and this comes in being able to demonstrate “success stories”, and to get “success stories” it is imperative at this point that the DAO proactively “force” their usage as much as possible:

1. Creators/ambassadors who have a CRT and have had a good outcome from utilizing the feature and are interested in sharing this success story with people.
2. Viewers/investors who have utilized CRTs and found a good outcome with them and share their success story with other people.

## Solution

**Require** anyone getting paid as either an ambassador or creator to have a CRT set up and for their rewards to be paid into the associated revenue account, this will ensure:

- They are actually using, or capable of using one of the core features of the platform and actually have an interest in their own personal CRT being attractive and successful
- That the amount the DAO is paying in rewards are actually going -into- one of the core features of the platform and not just directly to people who press “cashout” and don’t contribute in any way to the platform’s future.
- That outside users/market participants can actually take an interest in these rewards and partake and speculate on their success

Because of revenue splits and also the friction involved with using and maintaining the CRT function, I would suggest to:

- increase the amounts being paid
    - specifically in the case of ambassadors this seems applicable
- periodically issue rewards for “great examples of CRTs”
    - which are of course going to be paid into the CRT’s revenue account

It should be said that in both the case of ambassadors and creators, if they for some reason actively do not want to use the CRT feature then I would strongly argue that they are likely not suitable candidates for these roles—ambassadors in particular should be people with a continued interest and keen knowledge of the platform and its core functions and demonstrate a vested interest in the long term success of the platform.

- The CRT function is -literally- the most perfect example of where an ambassador can showcase their knowledge and interest in the platform firsthand and if they spend the time and effort to maintain and advertise their CRTs to a high standard they can receive rewards from the success of their CRTs directly outside of their regular rewards.
- The ambassador program could also make the creation of a CRT page a requirement for new ambassadors to even be approved for the program—it seems that with ChatGPT and some of the lower quality ambassadors that this might help to increase quality.

## Open Questions

- Some older users may get be getting continued rewards from YPP and as a result of this may stop receiving rewards if they do not keep up to date with the project or simply do not want to make the effort in creating a CRT.
    - My opinion is that their payouts should be stopped because they are not contributing to the platform or CRT feature which is critical for us at this point.
    - Payments could just accrue for this subset of users until they go through the effort to create a CRT.
    - As a matter of priority we should be trying to contribute to a smaller number of high value CRTs rather than just rewarding old users who do not check in (I do not know the scale of this, but I think it is worth stating this very bluntly)
- Some people have CRTs set up but do not have the market active, I am not sure how to solve this just yet.
    - I personally think that it should be required to have a market active.
- We only have the AMM function for markets which is a bit restrictive in some cases. I am not sure how to solve this in the near term.
- There may be some required changes to Atlas/Gleev to ensure notifications are possible for this to happen in the case of creators.
- It was previously either suggested or agreed that ambassador rewards would start being paid with vesting schedules
    - This is not only because of the market situation but also because it is a bad look if ambassadors just cash out and do not have any long term interest in the project
    - CRTs basically help to enforce this anyway and it is very unclear how much vesting schedules help in this particular situation—an ambassador with a great CRT page with many holders is a hell of a lot more interesting than an ambassador no one has heard of
    - I think this should be scrapped and that CRTs should be enforced as a requirement because they make the platform more attractive vs whatever the
