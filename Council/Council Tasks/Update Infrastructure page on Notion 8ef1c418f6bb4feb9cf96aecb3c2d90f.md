- The following page/database needs updating: [](https://www.notion.so/d593503167a049b2b7a2220c0502750d?pvs=21)
- It lists all the infrastructure running Joystream (such as QN, Orion and some other tooling) and “responsible people” who can be contacted in the event of downtime etc
- Some new infrastructure probably needs to be added, such as YPP stuff
- It was last updated in October 2022 (!)
