# OKRs - Q2 2024

### Overarching mission

<aside>
👉🏻 Provide quality values for bandwidth and latency (TTFB) accross geographical regions for which we are having sufficient traffic, keeping the cost of operation minimal.

</aside>

The “keeping the cost of operation minimal” section details how the DWG tries to minimize operational expenditure. The “Measuring methodology” section aims to provide definitions in what we mean by “quality values for bandwidth and latency” and “geographical region with sufficient traffic”.

A small observation first:

<aside>
💡 The DWG group is pretty stable in term of performance, so it doesn’t make sense to have lots of OKRs. Much of the risk lies in the operator responsiveness and competence

</aside>

The synthetic data support this, as we are observing excellent values for Download speed and Latency from the synthetic data ping location. This also mean that I am not planning on removing operator locations currently.

## Keeping the cost of operation minimal

Minimise the server spec requirements, steps in this direction already taken in the sense that now the recommended server specs are:

- CPU: 4 cores / 8t
- RAM: 16 GB
- SSD 500 GB (NVMes)
- Network traffic: at least 10 TB/ month

## Measuring methodology

1. RUM Data is collected into the Elasticsearch cluster.
2. Define `topCountries(t)` as the top **10** countries, aggregated by a unique count of records over a fixed term length of `t` days.
3. From this, we can measure median TTFB and Bandwidth values, and potentially the 90% percentile. A better approach might be to have a dedicated dashboard for both TTFB and Bandwidth, displaying box plots for each of the `topCountries`. **For OKR assessment I suggest we stick to the median value as a summary statistic**
4. As an OKR goal, it would be acceptable to have a Bandwidth and TTFB Latency value for each country. This is because network performance can vary significantly between countries, such as Germany (a highly developed country) and Bangladesh (a developing country). I suggest using reference values for each country from this [website](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/germany?fixed#market-analysis)
5. In June 2024, we will *compare* (see section below) values for the `topCountries(t)` with those from the SpeedTest website in for the following values of `t`: 
    1. `t` = 30 days (i.e. last month / last term) June 2024

## How to compare our result with SpeedTest

Speed test result consists, provide several result for each country, among which Download speed and latency. I could not find any other website that provide such readily available results, so I am going to use the SpeedTest website as reference.

We should look at the market research reports for each country if available for which the multiserver latency is available is provided. If market research page is not provided we should use the one from the nearest geographical country. (see picture for reference). 

Here’s how I am going to compare our data against the SpeedTest provided metric for assessing our OKR :

- Multiserver latency: the worst ISP reference value will be used in OKR assessment (TeleTalk in the reference picture) against our Latency - TTFB. (I am not going to use the Latency value in the Country Summary Panel, as I believe it’s is measured as the best value for Latency obtained during different server pings and thus quite hard to beat)
- Download speed: the worst ISP reference value will be used in OKR assessment (TeleTalk in the reference picture) against our Bandwidth

Our comparison is **successful** only if both the latency and bandwidth value are better than the value observed as prescribed above.

Given the above sections I can state the OKR

# Have values for Bandwidth and Latency above average user experience

We will measure the Latency and Bandwidth value according to the “Measuring Methodology” section and we will compare results according to the “How to compare result with SpeedTest” section.

### OKR assessment

- if the SpeedTest comparison is successful for `t = 30` days time window then the OKR is reached at 100% (meaning: good values for Latency and Bandwidth for June 2024)
- During Midterm calls OKR review the same procedure can be used using the 30 days time window. For example if we are having a Midterm call halfway through may then the time window to consider is 15 May 2024 - 15 April 2024 (approx)
