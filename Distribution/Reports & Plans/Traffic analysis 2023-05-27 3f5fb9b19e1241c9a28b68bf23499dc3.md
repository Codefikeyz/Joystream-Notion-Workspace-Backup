# Traffic analysis 2023-05-27

This is analysis of data from last 15 days (2023-05-12 to 2023-05-27). Keep in mind that this is a short timespan and may be biased. This will prove more useful once we collect data over longer periods.

We had 2800 unique visitors which I think is a pretty solid number. Spread of traffic across nodes is fairly equal, while geographically Russia and Ukraine account almost for half of total traffic.
