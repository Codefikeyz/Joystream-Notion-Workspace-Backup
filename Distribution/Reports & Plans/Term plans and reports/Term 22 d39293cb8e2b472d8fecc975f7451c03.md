Done. Tools was developed and deployed: [https://github.com/joyutils/dwg-tools/tree/main/apps/dwg-alerter](https://github.com/joyutils/dwg-tools/tree/main/apps/dwg-alerter) Example alert: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1172175011071664233](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1172175011071664233)

We don’t have enough results to do any bigger analysis for now. However, a dashboard to lookup results was created: [https://kibana.joyutils.org/app/dashboards?auth_provider_hint=anonymous1#/view/5feb0da0-751f-11ee-a4a5-731d19b33886?_g=(refreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A60000)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-7d%2Fd%2Cto%3Anow)](https://kibana.joyutils.org/app/dashboards?auth_provider_hint=anonymous1#/view/5feb0da0-751f-11ee-a4a5-731d19b33886?_g=(refreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A60000)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-7d%2Fd%2Cto%3Anow))) The benchmark results were already used in small investigation regarding slow playback user report: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1038170229555089458/1173608713748238347](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1038170229555089458/1173608713748238347)

Postponed, I’ve decided this is not that much needed right now, focused on benchmarks and other priorities.

### 4. Extra Items

1. There was a bug that made all QNs stuck and not processing new blocks. DWG operators quickly switched to public QN once it was available and upgraded local QNs.
2. 2 production nodes have enabled request tracing and some initial analysis was done. See [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035122847057727518/1171810710649585714](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035122847057727518/1171810710649585714) for some of the findings related to requests timing and video streaming from browsers.
3. We accidentally found out that all Argus nodes (and most likely Colossus) crash when they cannot send logs to Elasticsearch. After this happened, fix was prepared: [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/4963](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/4963#event-10928659932) Since it’s not high impact (we haven’t had ES-related crash before), it wasn’t deployed yet. It will be batched with other updates and deployed early next term.
4. Improvements to Argus & Colossus Elasticsearch logging were developed: [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/4964](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/4964) This will allow us to:
    1. Easily see all logs related to specific request in tracing. So if we see weirdly long request, we can easily explore all that happened in Argus node during request processing.
    2. Implement log retention and compression policies so our Elastic doesn’t grow too fast.
5. Some term stats (excluding QN incident at the beginning): [https://share.cleanshot.com/y22VdMT8](https://share.cleanshot.com/y22VdMT8) [https://share.cleanshot.com/k5mVjr3H](https://share.cleanshot.com/k5mVjr3H)
    1. 99.88% total uptime across nodes
    2. 99.33% success rate of asset requests
    3. For each ping testing region, node was available with image download time **lower than 70ms**.
    4. Served 48,745 unique users with total 5,170,387 asset downloads (~250 requests per minute). 40.7% of traffic came from Indonesia, 35% from Bangladesh.
