### Term 13 Report (17.06.23 - 02.07.23)

### 1. Current WG composition:

- [@klaudiusz](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - Lead, worker
- [@0x2bc](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker
- [@adovrn](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker
- [@sieemma](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker
- [@goksel](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker
- [@Craci_BwareLabs](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker
- [@Deathix](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members) - worker

During this term (technically already in term 14), one of the workers was fired from the group because of their repeating poor quality of service: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1125343908302422028](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1125343908302422028)

### 2. WG budget spending:

**Planned spending:** 137,320 JOY

**Starting budget:** 82,747.75 JOY

**End budget:** 96,451.25 JOY

**Budget refill:** 55,000 JOY

**Spending after term end:** 8 * 11,660 JOY = 93,280 JOY

**Total spending:** 82,747.75 JOY - 96,451.25 JOY +  55,000 JOY + 93,280 JOY = 134,576.5 JOY

**Comment:** Total spending was a bit lower since budget wasn’t enough to pay out monitoring worker salary.

### 3. OKRs progress:

Unfortunately no progress on OKRs was made this term. Lead’s availability has been very low because of health issues and allowed only for day-to-day operations.
