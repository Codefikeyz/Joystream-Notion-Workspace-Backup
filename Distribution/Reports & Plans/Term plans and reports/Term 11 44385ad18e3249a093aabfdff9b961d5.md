### 2. Planned WG budget:

**Planned spending:** up to 89,180 JOY

**Comment:** Details can be found in [the funding proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/324)

### 3. Term OKRs:

| **No.** | **Objectives** | **Key Results** | **Initiatives** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepare guidelines for minimal server requirements | 1) Page in Notion created with minimal server requirement for DWG | 1) Figure out values that make sense. 2) Create Notion page |
| 2 | Improve geographical distribution of distribution nodes | 1) Geographical spread of nodes is better matching the actual usage of the system. | 1) Prepare plan of where new nodes are needed. 2) Contact workers to figure out who could move their servers. 3) Execute |
| 3 | Clean up distribution families/buckets setup | 1) All the families<->buckets<->operators make sense and 
represent reality. | 1) Write down all the 
current location<->family associations. 2) Figure out if the list 
makes sense. 3) If not, come up with a plan on how to update it. |
| 4 | Improve monitoring | 1) Additional monitoring available for total node availability (including bucket being disabled) | 1) Write a small tool to ping all the operators and collect stats from QN. 2) Deploy |

Comment for No. 3: This has been planned for the last two terms as well, but no work was started, since I think it should be done alongside work in No. 2.

### 3. OKRs progress:

*Reference: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=3636](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/85?post=3636)*

- OKR 1 (Prepare guidelines for minimal server requirements):
Status: Done
Comment: Specs available here: [https://joystream.notion.site/Minimal-server-specs-3e99cec41ba04a7e96a4ce5e989daf7c](https://www.notion.so/3e99cec41ba04a7e96a4ce5e989daf7c?pvs=21) Currently waiting for feedback from workers. Once approved, will ask some nodes to be migrated to match those specs.
- OKR 2 (Improve geographical distribution of distribution nodes):
Status: In progress
Comment: Analysis of current CDN usage was done and recommendations for node changes were suggested: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/405](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/405) Workers were contacted and we have a migration plan, it will take up to 1 month to execute, so current server leases can expire.
- OKR 3 (Clean up distribution families/buckets setup):
Status: In progress
Comment: This is problematic because of some limitations of our current runtime and storage module. See discussion here: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035122847057727518/1112068922208964748](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035122847057727518/1112068922208964748) More thinking on what is the best way moving forward is required. Potentially we could postpone this until changes to storage module are done by JSG. Will continue analysis next term
- OKR 4 (Improve monitoring):
Status: In progress
Comment: I’ve started writing a small new service to monitor availability of servers. Not yet ready to be deployed.
- Extra things worked on:
    - Ongoing discussion and proposal on increasing worker salaries: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/337](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/337)
    - Some discussion with SWG lead on how to collect data from SWG&DWG nodes
    - Added support for Elasticsearch authentication to storage node: https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/4776
    - Created a traffic map: [https://joystream.koalva.io/operator-kibana/app/dashboards?auth_provider_hint=anonymous1#/view/3eddd3e0-fca2-11ed-858c-23f745f3e9e1?_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A0)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-30d%2Fd%2Cto%3Anow)](https://joystream.koalva.io/operator-kibana/app/dashboards?auth_provider_hint=anonymous1#/view/3eddd3e0-fca2-11ed-858c-23f745f3e9e1?_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A0)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-30d%2Fd%2Cto%3Anow)))
    - Created small traffic analysis: [https://joystream.notion.site/Traffic-analysis-2023-05-27-3f5fb9b19e1241c9a28b68bf23499dc3](../Traffic%20analysis%202023-05-27%203f5fb9b19e1241c9a28b68bf23499dc3.md)
