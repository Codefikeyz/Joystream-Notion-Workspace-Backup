| **Is it crypto related?** | **Does it meet  the YPP requirements? (>50 subs)** | **Is is a web3 project (i.e. Solana)** | **Do we want to keep this channel auto-syncing (on Gleev) so  that maybe in the future the council can independently reward this type of channel?** |

| Yes | No | No | Unclear—this really depends on what the cost of hosting the content is, but in the future if this type of channel does get more views/subscrbers the DAO could independently reward (outside of JSG operated YPP) |
