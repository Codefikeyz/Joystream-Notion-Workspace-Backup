# Council Term 6 Plan

Tags: Plan
Term: 6

## **1. Current group composition :**

- Lead: @tomato

# 2. Planned Budget for the Term

**Planned budget:** 

- Council Secretary is not a WG and is paid under the Membership WG budget.
- If any additional spending is needed it will be managed as it happens.

# 3. Group Priorities for the Term

- Tidy up `Community Roadmap` section on Notion
- Tidy up other main parts of Notion (a proposal was submitted to begin this process: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/181](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/181))
- Begin a review of each WG’s Notion section and recommend and/or propose changes.
- Figure out how to get proposals and forum threads sync’d into Notion for categorization. During the previous term I began discussion about this with the Builders WG: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1081088212467982336](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1081088212467982336)
    - Based on what tooling is currently available, it may be that a builder has to be hired to create a tool to make this happen.
- Lay out a plan to create discussions on all DAO parameters that can be adjusted by proposal (i.e. budget refill amount, membership price etc)
    - Then propose a schedule for this to happen (once per term, monthly etc)
- Continue review of handbook
- Maintain Community Leaderboard spreadsheet
- Add WG spending to council view on Community Leaderboard
