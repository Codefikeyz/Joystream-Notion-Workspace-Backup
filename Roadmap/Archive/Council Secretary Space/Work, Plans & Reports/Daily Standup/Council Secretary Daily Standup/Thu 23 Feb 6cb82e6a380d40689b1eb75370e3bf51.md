- Thu 23 Feb
    - Looked at other projects wrt sybil resistant faucets (at least one project, subsocial, requires users to join their mobile phone verified Discord and paste a OTP to recieve funds)
    - Began a review of the Joystream handbook with a focus on identifying areas that are either missing, incomplete or wrong.
    - Refilled faucet
    - Created pre-proposal thread + followed up for membership verification process.
    - Created response + issue for council members being unable to create membership WG budget refill via Pioneer
