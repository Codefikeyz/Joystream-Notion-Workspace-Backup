# Video engagement stats

Tags: Pre-proposal

It would be very useful to have a UI (perhaps Dapplooker) that can count the number of likes/comments/follows across the platform.

This data would be highly useful to understand how users engage with the platform and would be particularly useful for the Marketing WG so they can use these stats for promotional purposes (such as on Twitter).

It is important to understand that likes + comments are on-chain while people following channels is not.

There are multiple ways to look at the data but some basic ideas would be:

- Likes/comments per day/week/month
- Top 10 videos by likes / comments
- Top 10 channels by likes / comments

I plan to write a proposal for this but created this thread for community feedback. The proposal would assign this to the builders WG.
