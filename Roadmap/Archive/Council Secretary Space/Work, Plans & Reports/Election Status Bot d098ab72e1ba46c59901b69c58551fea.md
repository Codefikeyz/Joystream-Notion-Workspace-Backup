# Election Status Bot

Tags: Pre-proposal, Proposal

This proposal is for the development of an “Election Stats Bot” for Discord. Providing election stats is integral to keeping participants up to date with elections and also ensuring people keep enthusiastic. They are currently done manually (usually by me using stats that are only available on the Council Leaderboard spreadsheet).

If approved this task would be assigned to the Builders WG (the prioritization, budget and any deadlines are up to the council to enforce).

I would say this would work best either in the #council or maybe #general channel on Discord.

An example message would be something like this:

**Current election stats: - Stage: Reveal (2d 10h remaining!)**

- 5 candidates
- 134 votes total (49.578m $JOY)
- 49 revealed votes (20.507m $JOY)
- 85 unrevealed votes (45.617m $JOY)

Stages:

- Upon Election finish / Revealing stage over the bot announces new council, tags their discord username as linked with pioneer.
- Announce period starts - Bot announces this and mentions how long is left and how to apply etc
- Each time a candidate announces - Bot announces (i.e. “Fred has applied for the election”)
- Announce period ends/voting period starts - Bot announces + does an update of vote stats every 12h
- Revealing period starts/vote period ends - Bot does updated stats every 12h

Some examples of the presentation of stats etc can be found in the pre-proposal thread here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/325](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/325)
