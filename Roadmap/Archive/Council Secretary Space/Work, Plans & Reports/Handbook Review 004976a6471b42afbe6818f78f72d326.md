# Handbook Review

Tags: Handbook

The aim of this review is to go through the entire handbook and identify any blank sections etc. The primary goal (for now) is to focus on easy improvements and to try and cut down on the number of pages (if possible). JSG controls the handbook repo so any changes that are made have to go through their approval process.

It is important to remember that the purpose of the handbook is distinct, and its more like a whitepaper/technical explanation of the project than an easy to read tutorial. Nonetheless, since we lack any other central form of documentation it would be good to improve what we can.

After people have given their feedback I would like to put together a proposal which takes no more than 2-3 achievable improvements for the handbook and can be implemented (I think one of these would be to redo the front page and make the handbook’s purpose a lot clearer to anyone who accesses it)

First impressions:

- The front page seems to still be directed towards the FM program and doesn't explain what the project is in simple terms nor state the purpose of the handbook
    - The handbook is a very high level, technical explanation of how the project's functions work. It is equivalent to a whitepaper in complexity.
- There should be a link to the official project website and other main links on the front page (and/or a links page)
- Some pages like `builders` seem extraneous when they could just be included as a sub-page under `working groups`--WG’s that do not have special on-chain permissions (marketing, builders & HR) could probably all be treated the same.
- The `glossary` could do with a lot of additions
- It would be good to link to some relevant github issues for some sections for additional context/clarity (such as `Project Tokens`)

- Front Page - [https://handbook.joystream.org/](https://handbook.joystream.org/)
    - Missing an intro/short explanation of what the project is and what the purpose of the handbook is.
    - Missing Membership, Apps and some other WGs
    - Unclear if `Opportunities` list is still relevant--I think that it should be removed.
    - Broken link to handbook (under `Project Token` list item)
- $JOY
    - Some of these items could be put into a table for easier readability (i.e. ticker, initial supply etc)
- Founding Members - [https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program](https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program)
    - Timeline is incomplete. Should link to genesis block.
    - A link to the mainnet launch blog post on the Joystream blog should be included here
- Content Moderation - [https://handbook.joystream.org/content-policy](https://handbook.joystream.org/content-policy)
    - Outdated - page says so
    - Refers to testnet situation
    - Most of page should be scrapped
- JIP - [https://handbook.joystream.org/jip-process](https://handbook.joystream.org/jip-process)
    - Relatively new page so ignoring
- Launch Process - [https://handbook.joystream.org/carthage-rollout-plan](https://handbook.joystream.org/carthage-rollout-plan)
    - This page doesn't need to be so prominent anymore and could probably be relegated to being moved somewhere else (pending actual sudo key removal)
- Validators - [https://handbook.joystream.org/system/validation](https://handbook.joystream.org/system/validation)
    - Starts with a glossary
    - Probably needs a rewrite
    - Should link to some of the great dotsama tutorials on the same subject
