# Notion pre-proposal

Tags: Notion, Pre-proposal

I completed a review of our Notion here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/260](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/260)

I am waiting for some answers, but in the meantime I am planning on submitting a proposal soon that will request at least the following actions to be taken. The spirit of these actions will be to reduce complexity of the Notion and hide away items that are either no longer used, maintained or no longer relevant.

- An `archive` page is created
- `Important Updates` to be either deleted or moved to `archive`
    - This is no longer updated or maintained so just adds to noise. It mainly contains testnet-relavent items
- `Pioneer` to be moved to `archive`
    - Hasn’t been used or updated in a long time but contains some valuable information
    - I am waiting for feedback from JSG on this item as it was created and maintained by them
- `Knowledge Base (WIP)`
    - Not maintained by anyone but could be reactivated if there is a need for it. To be moved to `archive`
- `Incentives v3 Scoring`
    - FM/incentives program is over, so this could be moved to `archive`
- `Incentives Resources`
    - Same as above
- `Tools and Resources`
    - Same as above
