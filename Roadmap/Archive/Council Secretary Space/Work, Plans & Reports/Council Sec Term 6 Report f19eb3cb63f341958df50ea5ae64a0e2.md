## **1. Current group composition :**

- Tomato - Council Secretary

## **2. Budget for the Term**

**Planned budget:** 

- Council Secretary is not a WG and is paid under the Membership WG budget.

## **3. Work status for the Term**

- Tidy up `Community Roadmap` section on Notion
    - Completed
- Tidy up other main parts of Notion (a proposal was submitted to begin this process: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/181](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/181))
    - Completed
- Begin a review of each WG’s Notion section and recommend and/or propose changes.
    - Not Completed, pushed to next term
- Figure out how to get proposals and forum threads sync’d into Notion for categorization. During the previous term I began discussion about this with the Builders WG: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1081088212467982336](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1081088212467982336)
    - This has been 50% completed, there are still some issues which I anticipate solving soon≥
- Lay out a plan to create discussions on all DAO parameters that can be adjusted by proposal (i.e. budget refill amount, membership price etc) Then propose a schedule for this to happen (once per term, monthly etc)
    - This has partly been done but still requires an overview document
- Continue review of handbook
    - Completed
- Maintain Community Leaderboard spreadsheet
    - Completed
- Add WG spending to council view on Community Leaderboard
    - Not completed because dapplooker dashboard does it better/automated
