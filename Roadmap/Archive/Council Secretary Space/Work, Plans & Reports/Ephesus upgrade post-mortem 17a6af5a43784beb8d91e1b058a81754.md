# Ephesus upgrade post-mortem

Description: First runtime upgrade to `Ephesus`

Date: April 12th, 2023

Important links:

- Risk assessment: link
- Proposal: link

Upgrade Events:

- Voting proceeded through the required number of council terms without any noticeable events.
- `runtime` upgrade occurred successfully at blockheight `xyz`
    - No noticeable change with block production or anything else really occurred.
- JSG took care of a lot of the communication to various parties within the DAO (such as infrastructure providers) which helped things significantly. Things like the risk assessment etc would be essential for the DAO to conduct on any future runtime upgrades.

Problems

- 2 proposals failed due to the upgrade. This was expected behavior and Discord was used to ensure the current Council was aware of this happening. The impact of this was mostly negligible (besides lost stake for the authors of these proposals).
