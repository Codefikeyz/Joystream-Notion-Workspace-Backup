Security Disclosure Policies for some crypto projects:

- [https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities)
    - *The primary goal for the Geth team is the health of the Ethereum network as a whole, and the decision whether or not to publish details about a serious vulnerability boils down to minimizing the risk and/or impact of discovery and exploitation. At certain times, it’s better to remain silent. This practice is also followed by other projects such as [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html), [ZCash](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) and [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret).*
    - *As of November 2020, our policy going forward is:*
        - *If we silently fix a vulnerability and include the fix in release `X`, then,*
        - *After 4-8 weeks, we will disclose that `X` contained a security-fix.*
        - *After an additional 4-8 weeks, we will publish the details about the vulnerability.*
    - A published `JSON` file containing known vulnerabilities for Ethereum (geth)
        - Extremely well detailed and includes great metadata
        - [https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities.json](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities.json)
    

Issues / Lessons:

- Lack of defined process or communication channels for disclosing and/or handling urgent security matters (NOTE: this is not accurate and seems to just reflect poor information flow within the Polkadot ecosystem)
    - *Currently, as I’m writing this post, there are some security vulnerabilities in Substrate that could be abused on some Parachains but have not been disclosed by Parity. I suppose they want to have it fixed/deployed in the relaychain before revealing them but I think it is a bad strategy for the ecosystem.*
    - *I would also add that as a founder/lead on one of the parachains that may be affected by this, I have not received any responsible disclosure on this alleged vulnerability. That also seems very odd to me.*
    - [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/improving-the-substrate-ecosystem-vulnerabilities-disclosure/38](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/improving-the-substrate-ecosystem-vulnerabilities-disclosure/38)
- Indecision regarding ownership of, or financing audits of pallets between different parties:
    - *In addition to the difficulty to maintain it, Parity’s (to my understanding) doesn’t want to take any responsibility for Frontier’s pallet/code/issues, making it hard to guarantee its quality and support. (The Moonbeam foundation is currently the one paying for audits in the Frontier/EVM repos)*
    - *We’ve been contributing to Frontier for a couple of years now and I think Wei has done great designing and reviewing the project proposals but Alan is right in that a single maintainer can sometimes drag reviewing process depending on that person’s schedule, which is totally fine, but can be simply solved by having more eyes on it.*
