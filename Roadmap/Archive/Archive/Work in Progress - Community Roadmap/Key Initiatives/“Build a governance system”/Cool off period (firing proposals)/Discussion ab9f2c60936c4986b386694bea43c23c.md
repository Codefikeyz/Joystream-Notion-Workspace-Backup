# Discussion

So if we didn't introduce something like this in the governance system, then it wouldn't have a name, so lets call this `Situation A`
0. The project is going great, we have a stable network and good leads, everyone communicates well.
1. Someone goes through a WG lead's Twitter account and raised some "problematic tweets" they made 23 years ago when they were aged 8. A firing proposal is made, people have been hassling all of the elected council members and the council has just never dealt with a situation like this before. The WG lead rapidly get fired 30 minutes after a tweet or theirs about Britney Spears is deemed insensitive and they're slashed for thousands of dollars as punishment for their "wrong opinions"
2. In the moment, people are divided--half are saying `"this is stupid, their views about Britney don't impact their work, they have a 6 month record and are perfect, who cares about their tweet"` and half are saying `"well fuck you, I love Britney, you can go get fucked"`
3. Maybe a day later, "the dust has settled" a little bit and people start inquiring `"How can you act on something like this so quickly?"`
4. A month later, more and more information comes to light and everyone uses it as an example of a failure--at this point a very valuable lesson has been learned by the community at the `very large expense` of the project's reputation and integrity and all the people who participated
5. As well as `4` the tokens involved in other areas of the platform are shuffled around in various power struggles. This adds to the `very large expense` of this initial problem because it impacts the platform's stability as a whole

OTOH, lets say we did introduce this, it was discussed back and forth by the community, some of the definitions/wording changes but the end result is that this problem already has a name: `cooldown period`

0. The project is going great, we have a stable network and good leads, everyone communicates well.
1. Someone goes through a WG lead's Twitter account and raised some "problematic tweets" they made 23 years ago when they were aged 8. 
2. A firing proposal is made, but is filled with dozens of comments from Joystream users about the `cooldown period`
3. The proposal is rejected/abstained--and in our governance system each council member can write the reason why they voted so. So if I were trying to be a good council member, I would say something like `"Britney Spears is not a topic worthy of a stable, reputable WG lead getting fired. I do not believe I can make a sensible decision yet, we should wait a while and reconsider this once people have calmed down"`
4. *hopefully* everyone calms down, maybe the person apologizes to the devout Britney Spears fans, maybe they tell Britney's fans to go fuck themselves.

But simply because the idea of `cooldown period` existed, optimistically we avoid the `very large expense` of having to learn this lesson naturally.

I am in favor of the council and our project learning from its own mistakes, but this particular event draws from a real life example within the web3 space and has such a simple solution that isn't that dramatic--I think this is a very `reasonable` and very `achievable` thing.
Allowing for some reasonable "cooldown period" before making a decision like this would *hopefully* avoid consequences of instability and governance token fighting.
If the council members didn't do the "cooldown period" thing, it would fall upon their reputation.

Critical to all of this is that `cooldown period` is so simple and isn't really asking much--you're not telling the council to act in a yes/no way, you're just saying "hey, it might be reasonable to wait a little while before making a final decision in a situation like this" (probably a situation for voting `abstain`)
It's nowhere near the same as like writing a rule that the council should exceed its budget by 45% on Tuesday or allowing the council to fund some political/social cause that isn't directly related to the project
