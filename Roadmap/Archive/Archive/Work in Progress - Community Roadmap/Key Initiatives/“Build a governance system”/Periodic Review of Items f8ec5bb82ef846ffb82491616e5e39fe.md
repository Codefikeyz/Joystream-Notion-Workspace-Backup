Summary:

- This is what I think would be a `common sense` topic
- Any rules or topics agreed on by the council should be reviewed after some period of time
- The period of time for review may be different depending on the scope or importance of the issue
- It would maybe be up to the `Council Secretary` role to keep track of these and make discussion threads when required.
- All users should be able to participate in the discussion
- There is no requirement for any changes to be made or proposed based upon discussion, it is simply creating periodic dialog for items.
- If a user is convinced that a change is necessary, they can take action however they want to.
- This has never been discussed or proposed from what I can remember.
