# Council Leaderboard

The Council Leaderboard is a Google Spreadsheet that captures data from the Joystream DAO blockchain and automatically updates every 6 hours. It is an imperfect solution but is great for rapidly accessing data sets from Joystream and understanding events outside of relying on Pioneer.

How it works:

- API Connector plugin for Google Sheets
- API Connector accesses GraphQL queries on the Joystream Query Node as well as the Subsquid node
- All Queries used are available on the `intro` sheet on the spreadsheet, they can also be found here: [](https://www.notion.so/8696f2d7557e4da6af5bde645db704cb?pvs=21)
