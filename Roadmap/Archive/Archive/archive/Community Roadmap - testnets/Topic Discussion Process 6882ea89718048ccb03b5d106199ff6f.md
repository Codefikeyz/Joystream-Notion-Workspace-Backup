## Process for discussing topics within the Community Roadmap

<aside>
👍 Anyone with access to the `Community Roadmap` area on Notion can do this. People can work alone or together on this. The idea is to build up discussion and research of topics that relevant to after mainnet launch to help the community have a shared vision and goals.
None of the work has to be permanent and can be adjusted as needed.

Basic

1. When basic draft is ready, a proposal is made on testnet linking to `topic` on testnet
2. Council vote to approve whether topic is worthy of community discussion
3. If approved:
    - A forum thread is made in `pre-proposal forum discussion` ([https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/category/6](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/category/6))
    - The forum thread and Notion page are linked to on Discord
4. The community can provide feedback, discuss aspects and talk about ideas and introduce research
5. After some time period has elapsed, the community secretary or another person compiles the community feedback into an organized fashion on the Notion page

1. **Title**

*A short, descriptive topic*

- *“Large Scale Storage Network Scaling”*
- *“Moderation Tools”*
- *“Gateway/Application development”*
- *“Project management/tracking”*

---

1. **A brief description**

A *bit about what the topic is about*

> *Block Explorers are essential and we do not yet have a fully functional one. As we are substrate based there are already a variety of solutions available and it would be good to explore these and understand the benefits/negatives with each one and what potential costs may be involved with utilizing them. Some customization would probably be required due to our DAO having extensive customization.*

1. **Key Points**

*Some basic bullet points raising questions/ideas/concerns would be a great help to get the topic started!*

- *What substrate compatible solutions already exist?*
    - *Features?*
    - *Open/closed source?*
- *What do we want a block explorer to do relevant to Joystream DAO compared to common block explorers?*
- *How much work would it be to integrate Joystream’s runtime features/types with preexisting solutions?*

## ***Extra Steps (not completely necessary)***

---

1. **Internal Links**

*If there are already discussions relevant to the topic on GitHub or other sources, it is good to include them, they can be added later on though.*

1. **Research**
    
    *If you can, research a few basic examples or external resources relevant to the topic. This could be a simple collection of links or a table with Titles, Links, Notes and Labels of data for easier sorting*
    

---

1. **Metadata field: `Areas`**

*It’s a good idea to fill in areas of the project that the topic is relevant to, you can choose more than one and create new ones as needed.*
