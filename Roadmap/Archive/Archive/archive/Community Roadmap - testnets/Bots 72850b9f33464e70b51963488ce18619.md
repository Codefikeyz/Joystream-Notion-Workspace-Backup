Bots have inarguably served a vital purpose in pushing growth and activity since the earliest phases/testnets of the Joystream platform. They have been vital in carrying information from source to destination in an automated way which cuts out a lot of “make work” in the platform seeking to better inform its users.

Some people find the bots to be too “spammy”.
