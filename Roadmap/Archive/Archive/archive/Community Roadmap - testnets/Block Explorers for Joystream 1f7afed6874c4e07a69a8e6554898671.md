### **Brief Description**

*Block Explorers are essential and we do not yet have a fully functional one. As we are substrate based there are already a variety of solutions available and it would be good to explore these and understand the benefits/negatives with each one and what potential costs may be involved with utilizing them. Some customization would probably be required due to our DAO having extensive customization.*

### **Key Points**

- *What substrate compatible solutions already exist?*
    - *Features?*
    - *Open/closed source?*
- *What do we want a block explorer to do relevant to Joystream DAO compared to common block explorers?*
- *How much work would it be to integrate Joystream’s runtime features/types with preexisting solutions?*
