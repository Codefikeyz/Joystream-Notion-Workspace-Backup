### Brief description

*Upon mainnet launch, the council & community will have to coordinate on a number of proposals required for launch, this includes things like:*

- *proposals for hiring leads*
- *proposals for setting up working groups*
- *proposals for setting up invites*
- *proposals for budgets*
- *proposals for WG minting*

*It is necessary to figure out how to time these proposals and take into account the `constitutionality` and other aspects of each proposal*

- NOTE: there are 9 working groups, each must have a lead and a budget to operate--**this alone is at minimum**:
- 9 lead opening proposals
- 9 lead hiring proposals
- 9 initial budget/mint fill proposals
