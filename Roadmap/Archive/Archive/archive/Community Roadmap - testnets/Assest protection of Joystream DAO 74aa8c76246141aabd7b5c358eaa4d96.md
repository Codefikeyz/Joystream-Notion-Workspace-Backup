# Assest protection of Joystream DAO

Type: Draft

First we need to consider the importance of “assest protection of Joystream DAO”, lets walk through two examples:

1. MWG atlas channel is accessible by Maria(MWG deputy lead) and Ismail malik (MWG lead). What if we misuse our access, then Joystream DAO will not only loose a assest, we will loose another thing too, first see the second example
2. Second, if tomato misuse his owner’s access to notion then also we will not loose a assest, instead we will loose trust of community. Also, media and our competitors will call us an unsuccessful experiment. 

Second we need to understand why community is important:

- In web3 projects, product is open source and anyone can copy it but if someone can’t copy, this is the community only and community is branding of any web3 project.

Ok, now we have understand why such “assest protection of Joystream DAO” is necessary. Now we should do this:

1. MWG should make its governance safe and no one should allow to misuse, and if someone intends to do then system will resist or consequences of such action will resist.
2. If someone go out of touch for longer period then DAO shouldn’t get affected. 

We can make fool proof governance system, this isn’t impossible thing. We should own this issue together. We will do it. 

Still feel confused:

Quadriga crypto exchange collapse is an example to learn. This is the reason “why council member of 28 term (ismail) is raising this concern within community?”
