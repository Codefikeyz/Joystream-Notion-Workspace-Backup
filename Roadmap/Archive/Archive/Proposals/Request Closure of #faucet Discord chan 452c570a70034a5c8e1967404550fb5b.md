Based on discussion here: [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/199](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/199)

We still get many users trying to operate a faucet bot in #faucet that doesn't exist anymore. The best solution seems to be to just delete the channel.

If the proposal gets approved I will tag JSG to delete this channel.
