# Council Plan Term 6

Blockheight: 1244154
Author: jen4ph
Council Approvals: 1
Date: March 6, 2023 5:49 (GMT+1)
Proposal Number: 182
Proposal Type: SignalProposalDetails

The council plan having to be approved as a Signal Proposal has not been exercised before until Council Term 5 – it was requested implicitly by a very valuable community member to have it approved by the council as a sign of commitment for the work that will be performed by the council for the rest of the term.

In addition, having this approved, will show unity and acknowledgment from the council members of the specific plans for this term. This will also serve as a guiding material on which the leads and the councils as they tackle the daily operations in the working groups and in the DAO as a whole.

If this will be approved, this info will be immediately disseminated to the leads and the rest of the community for their reference and for awareness, otherwise, the same thing is expected to happen only that the degree of acceptance and impact from the community and the leads might be less compared to having to share an approved one.
