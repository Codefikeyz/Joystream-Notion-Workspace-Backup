# Progressive Web App for Atlas/Gleev

Description: Development of a progressive web app for Atlas/Gleev that will allow for the app to be installed on user’s smartphones without having to go through app stores.
Team: DAO
Products: Atlas
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q3
Roadmap v1 Feasibility Notes: This would require extensive development time + resources depending on how it is done
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: - probably needs a lot more clarity about PWA vs appstore app vs whatever other technical option

per klaudiusz:
- MVP shouldn’t take huge resources, could be Q2
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - Apple killed PWAs, then unkilled them
- Per Klaudiusz, it is pretty straightforward
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - blocked by transcoding etc
- tied to native app which JSG is working on
- no progress due to other priorities per klaudiusz
- leet_joy (CM/marketing lead) would like to ship in Q3—rationale: notifications (depending how they work) can greatly increase user “stickyness”
