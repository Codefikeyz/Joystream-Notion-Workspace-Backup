Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: per mrbovo:
- should wait for more demand for NFT feature, or assessment of whether current limited implementation is the cause of lack of demand
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - Dmitry has said demand for these features is low and that we should focus more on CRT functionality / social features
 - Klaudiusz says also low priority strategically
Y/N: yes
