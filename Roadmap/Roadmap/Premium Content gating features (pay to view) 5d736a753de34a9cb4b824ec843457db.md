Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - current description doesn’t include CRT gating functionality—description needs to be updated to reflect this
- per klaudiusz, this is maybe blocked by content authentication. we could maybe do a version of this without full authentication.
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - klaudiusz: wouldn’t require runtime work, can be done just on app
