# Content Curator Tooling

Description: Improved tooling for our Content Curator Working Group that will allow for them to better handle the large amount of uploads they manage each day.
Team: DAO
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: per klaudiusz:
- there is a tool, it was built in the last quarter, there are a lot of features that still need to be added
- tool may be low value
- value of tool can only be reassessed in tandem with a reassessment of CRP WG workflow

per igrex:
- will highlight some potential improvements in their plan
