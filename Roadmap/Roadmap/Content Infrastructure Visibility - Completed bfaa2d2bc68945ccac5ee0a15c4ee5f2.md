# Content Infrastructure: Visibility - Completed

Description: With greater utilisation and scale, it has become clear that there is a need for better visibility into errors and performance levels at different layers of the infrastructure. This means both capturing data from the consumer and infrastructure layer, and also synthetically probing infrastructure to detect problems as early as possible. Currently, there is quite poor visibility into the performance of infrastructure, and the experience of users in interacting with this infrastructure. The goal of this milestone is to ship a set of integrations and standards for core infrastructure nodes, like Argus, Orion, to facilitate such visibility.
