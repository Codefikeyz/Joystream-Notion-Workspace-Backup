# Content Infrastructure: Performance V1

Description: Having very low latency of content delivery is a critical requirement for any social content product that involves users navigating across lots of different content over time. This depends on having well configured nodes with appropriate technical specifications, and most importantly - properly architecture node software. With the benefit of prior work on visibility we will have a solid foundation for ensuring that we can reach industry benchmarks for video content delivery, and that is the goal of this milestone.
