Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - per Dmitry, to replace NFT improvements
- dependent on gated content (some parts of it)
- Dmitry opinion is based on interviews with creators
- Does this include social feed? (tomato)
- Tomato to discuss w/ dmitry to refine
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - dmitry: still pursuing, gated content should precede it. Quite some UX work etc required
