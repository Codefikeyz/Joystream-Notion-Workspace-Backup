# Pioneer Financials Page - V1

Description: A new module for Pioneer that will show the current financials of the DAO, which will show data for spending and accounting for the council and all working groups.
Team: DAO
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: Not started
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: JSG will not be working on this

per klaudiusz:
- designs are kinda done, haven’t been reviewed properly, will need to be adjusted if we actually want to start on it
- scope wasn’t properly defined
- probably requires a custom squid and some more complexities

per tomato:
- doesn’t address context of USD-30 rate or what actual council/WG plan reports say, without which doesn’t really address needs 
Y/N: no
