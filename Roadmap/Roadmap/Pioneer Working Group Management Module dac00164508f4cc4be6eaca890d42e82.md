# Pioneer Working Group Management Module

Description: Adds functionality to Pioneer which allow for our working groups to create and manage job openings, hire and fire workers as well as adjust worker salaries more easily. This will reduce the technical knowledge required to use the DAO and increase the appeal of Joystream in areas such as marketing and outreach.
