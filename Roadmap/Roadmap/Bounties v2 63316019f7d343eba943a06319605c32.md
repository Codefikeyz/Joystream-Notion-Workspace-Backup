# Bounties v2

Description: Development & deployment of an on-chain bounty management module that will enable bounties to be posted and crowdfunded by users including oracle selection and reward splitting. The council will also have the unique feature of being able to fund bounties that it selects for being of benefit to the platform via the council treasury.
Team: DAO
Products: Pioneer, Query Node, Runtime
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: Not started
ETA (Quarter): 2025 Q1
Roadmap v1 Feasibility Notes: This would require quite a lot of work, up to community to decide
Status / Notes: Bedeho on status of module currently: bounty v2 probably needs a second review by an experienced substrate dev, probably at least a full week, before getting unfiltered.
it has new changed behaviours, so mappings need to be tweaked, and designs. To precisely understand how designs need to be changed, a designer has to look carefully at old functionality, and then look at new behaviour, to understand how to update.

Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: bedeho:
- super complicated, super high cost, super high risk due to complexity
- very big cost/value question

mrbovo:
- button could be removed from Pioneer / handbook
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - general consensus is to leave it
Y/N: maybe
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - bedeho/dmitry: very complex module, unpacking/pioneer changed required, audit required
