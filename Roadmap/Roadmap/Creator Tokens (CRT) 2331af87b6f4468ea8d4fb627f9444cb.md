# Creator Tokens (CRT)

Description: Creator tokens is a key financial, value capture and community growth primitive unlocked by Joystream. It allows creator to issue a fungible token which captures revenue generated by their channel, and distributes a share of it pro-rate with token holders. There are also complementary features around bootstrapping liquidity, raising funds through a public sale, and also managing access and vesting. This functionality has already been implemented in the blockchain and indexing infrastructure, and very mature designs have already been designed, what remains is to ship a fully working experience which productises this.
