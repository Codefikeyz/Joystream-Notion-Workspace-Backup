# Creator Rewards Program

Description: Objective of the program is to offer creators a broader range of activities to be rewarded for. Overall the focus of rewards is shifting from rewards for syncing to holistic engagement and driving the platform growth. As part of the rewards program creators are offered the opportunity to maximize rewards by posting original content to Gleev App ahead of other platforms, and further with utilizing Gleev branding assets. Promoting their channel's NFTs and Tokens on social media and actively participating in the creator's community opens up more additional opportunities for monetizing engagement with Joystream platform.
