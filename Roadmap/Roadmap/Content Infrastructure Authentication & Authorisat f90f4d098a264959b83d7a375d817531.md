# Content Infrastructure: Authentication & Authorisation

Description: Proper monetization, both for the DAO and individual creators, depends on being able to practically restrict access to content, or make access conditional. Currently, the infrastructure has no awareness of who the consumer is, or the semantics around what the content is, or any associated authorization policy. The goal of this milestone is to introduce basic authentication and authorization at the content layer, enforced by content delivery nodes. This will allow features such as gating videos to only NFT holders for example.
Team: DAO
Council Approval Status: N/A - JSG
Work Status: Not started
ETA: January 1, 2024 → March 31, 2024
ETA (Quarter): 2025 Q1
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: This is a maybe—JSG will not do this, will DAO do this?

Per Klaudiusz, DAO will do this
- we should be doing, revenue model depends on this being done, question is when, Q2 is unrealistic
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - Per Klaudiusz, leave in Q4 and we can revisit in future roadmap calls
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - klaudiusz: not a hard requirement for content gating so may not be that useful
