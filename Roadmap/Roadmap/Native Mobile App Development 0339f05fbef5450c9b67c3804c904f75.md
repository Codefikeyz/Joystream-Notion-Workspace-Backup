# Native Mobile App Development

Description: Development of a native mobile app for major smartphone platforms.
Team: DAO, JSG
Products: Atlas, Mobile (smartphone)
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q4
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - per Bedeho, opens a lot of doors, can give proper wallet experience. Difficulty shouldn’t stop it, not really in the “very hard category”. Think it is worth doing from ROI perspective. more familiar onboarding is better.
- per Klaudius, very hard to do—would take lot of time to develop. complexity/politics of app store nonsense
- per dmitry, going native is the way to go—PWA as a first. Look & feel could be compromised. Should be done in steps—first step should be a MVP/fractional implementation. Maybe other parts of platform need to be more developed before this is considered—ongoing cost is important to consider.
- per Jenny, better to understand complexities but otherwise non-committal. Recent marketing call said most/significant # of users were mobile. More research needed
- per bedeho, access to playstore stuff is big selling point (ratings, notifications, native settings etc)
- per tomato, payment rails are benefit
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - bedeho: very much depends on priorities. Needs time for quality deployment
