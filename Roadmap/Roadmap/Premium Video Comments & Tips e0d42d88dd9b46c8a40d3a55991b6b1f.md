# Premium Video Comments & Tips

Description: Add functionality for users to leave comments on videos with a tip attached to them that will be sent to the channel owner. This will also enable functionality for users to tip channels and videos directly.
Team: DAO, JSG
Products: Atlas, Metaprotocol, Query Node
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q3
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: per klaudiusz:
- would require quite a bit of design work (who tipped etc)

per bedeho:
- would be most effective to have JSG do it (they have designer, resources and is relatively small/easy and “we are supposed to have it”)
- maybe Q4, contingent on “video communities” roadmap item
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - per dmitry, low handing fruit, should be q3
- per klaudiusz, should be q3 also
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - bedeho: it’s being designed, concept is done, dev work is to be started
- dmitry: there are some other atlas changes (trading activity/charts etc), and then also add chat. Q3 is reasonable for deployment
