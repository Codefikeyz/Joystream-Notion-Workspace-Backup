# Joystream SDK

Description: Building on top of Joystream today is still a challenging experience. There are no robust libraries or builder documentation for application development. Offering an excellent experience for developer to build apps, and not just use Atlas off-the shelf, will require a significant investment in building out the SDK. This milestone has as a goal to extract the core of key existing applications, like Atlas and Pioneer, and then to synthesize it all into a new core developer experience, with a suite of excellent tutorials, documentation, examples and also active outreach.

Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - per klaudiusz, started on this, Q4 makes sense
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - klaudiusz: depends on priorities after bridge, is possible—should be next priority 
- bedeho: shouldn’t be a giant priority based on demand
- klaudiusz: should be started on—people shouldn’t be gatekept by pure Gleev. Scope needs to be decided on.
- tomato: value proposition vs video communities needs to be discussed
- klaudiusz: needs to do a testrun to deploy orion + atlas to understand how complex it is to ascertain value of this/painpoints and see if it can be simplified
