# BASE Bridge (Ethereum L2)

Description: Development & deployment of a bridging solution on Joystream that will allow for interoperability with Ethereum’s L2 BASE. In this first version, the goal would be to make JOY accessible on BASE as an ERC20 token. This would allow JOY to be traded, custodied and used with a much wider set of tools.
