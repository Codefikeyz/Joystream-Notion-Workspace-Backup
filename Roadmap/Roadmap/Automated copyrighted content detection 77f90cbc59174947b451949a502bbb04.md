# Automated copyrighted content detection

Description: In the case someone uploads copyrighted content on the DAO, there should be a way to detect it, so the actual creator of the copyrighted material can monetize, even before they register with the platform. I say this because once Joystream gets popular over time, there will be some infringers that will try to take advantage. This is something that happened to YouTube prior to Google's acquisition
