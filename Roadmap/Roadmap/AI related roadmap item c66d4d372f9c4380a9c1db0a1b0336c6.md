# AI related roadmap item

Products: AI
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: Not started
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - per leet_joy important to have, could relate to AI video generation (where you put a prompt), language translation (from language A>B and add a voice over). space is fast changing, but idea is to improve end-user for experiences… good item marketing wise
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - dmitry: only viable thing is for video language detection / not cheap
- yasir: could be subtitles etc, based on view count as threshold for access
- bedeho: doesn’t really need to be delineated as “AI” could just be “subtitles” item
