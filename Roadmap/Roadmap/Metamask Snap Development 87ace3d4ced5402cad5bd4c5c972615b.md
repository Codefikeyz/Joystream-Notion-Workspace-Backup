# Metamask Snap Development

Description: Development of a “Metamask Snap”, this would allow Metamask users to store, receive and send $JOY tokens.
Team: DAO
Products: External - Wallets
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q2
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - possible to just fork another polkadot metamask snap
- per klaudiusz we could maybe do it earlier, he has seen some substrate networks with snaps, polkadot snap is working now. thinks value proposition is quite high—asking to install a non-metamask wallet is very high friction (could in theory be done in 2-3 days)
- per tomato, need to know whether ledger would support it
- pet leet_joy we should try to build this sooner
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - per klaudiusz - likely within next term for pioneer and a review of a PR required for Atlas/Gleev
