# New Wallets - v2

Description: Implementations with external wallet providers such as hardware & software wallet providers (Tangem, Ledger)
Team: 3rd party, DAO
Products: External - Wallets
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q3
Sub-item: Ledger Support (Ledger%20Support%20f28ebc335e504dcaae724f9dba19a567.md), Nova Wallet (Nova%20Wallet%205d1142da85a34b08a41807977fea5618.md)
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: Tangem - unknown ETA at this point in time
Ledger - hypothetically generic signer will come in Q1, but likely to be Q2 based on software delivery timeframe magic
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: Tangem - we were added to their roadmap
Ledger - still dependent on generic signer + we have to do a runtime upgrade to support it
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - Tangem is done, pending announcement
- DAO is responsible for some costs depending on sales
- Ledger is pending runtime upgrade (which seems minor)
