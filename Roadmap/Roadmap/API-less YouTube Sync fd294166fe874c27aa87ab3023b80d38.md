# API-less YouTube Sync

Description: This functionality would enable for channels to sync to Joystream via our YouTube Partner Program without relying on YouTube’s API.
Team: JSG
Products: YPP, Youtube-sync
Council Approval Status: Not started
Work Status: In progress
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q3
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: JSG is working on this per bedeho
Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - Per bedeho on March 20, 2024, this is implemented but not shipped so Q2 2024 is fine
Y/N: yes
Roadmap v4 Feasibility: - per bedeho, in the QA stage awaiting some reviews, delayed due to other priorities
- recent YT A/B testing has either embedded ads or forced YT account logins—may require some fiddling/workarounds (would only be req’d if YT actually does changes)
