# Fiat On/Off Ramp

Description: Getting started with Joystream in one of our consumer apps is super easy, as you are floated a small initial balance of tokens you can only use for transaction fees. However, there are plenty of features which do require more substantial quantities of tokens, such as buying NFTs or Creator Tokens, and conversely, as a creator you are likely eager to not only have the native token, but to cash out to Fiat. For both of these reasons we are working on introducing a proper in-app on/off ramp for consumers and creators of an Atlas app. There are many great ramp partners, such as Transak, which have robust low-friction buy/sell widgets for crypto using credit cards, Apple/Google pay, from across a large number of jurisdictions.
Team: JSG
Council Approval Status: N/A - JSG
Work Status: Done
ETA: January 1, 2024 → March 31, 2024
ETA (Quarter): 2024 Q1
Roadmap v2 Feasibility Notes: Includes design component, which is in progress with JSG (magda)
technical + design side is easy

Negotiations with actual provider still ongoing (boring financial + geographical stuff)



Roadmap v3 Feasibility: - We have changenow, but it doesn’t not include fiat on/off ramp

- per bedeho, would cost extra 20k USD. maybe interesting to do but cost/risk/reward
Y/N: yes
