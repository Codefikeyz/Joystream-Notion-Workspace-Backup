# Content Search V2

Description: Searching across videos and channels, and also doing search within channels or content categories, is important for effective discovery. Currently, Orion has very rudimentary full text natural language matching on titles and descriptions, but it is very brittle and naive, and often misses the mark. The goal of this milestone is to ship proper modern search capabilities.
