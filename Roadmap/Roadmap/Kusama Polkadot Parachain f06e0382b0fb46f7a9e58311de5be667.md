# Kusama/Polkadot Parachain

Description: Becoming a Kusama parachain would make sense for Joystream because it would provide enhanced security, interoperability, governance, community-building opportunities, exposure, partnerships, and credibility, which are all essential for any marketing effort.
Products: External - Bridges/parachains, Runtime
Council Approval Status: Discussion
Work Status: Not started
Difficulty: Very High
Part of Roadmap v1?: ?
Roadmap v1 Feasibility Notes: Very big decision
URL: https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/473
Y/N: no

@tomato  POV:

- Many parachains are DeFi products and have relatively low amounts of activity. To put into perspective Joystream already has more signed extrinsics than any parachain currently on Polkadot or Kusama
- Parachain auction system is discontinuing, the exact way the mechanism will change is still unclear but this means that parachain slots are sort of “up in the air” for the next 9-12 months (at the very least)
- Because we are an already launched solochain it seems like we would have to scrap the current chain, build a new one and replay all the current TXs onto the new one. This sounds very technically involved as we have already existed for 6 months + have millions of extrinsics (most parachains do not have this situation).
- It seems unlikely that the Polkadot community would accept us as a parachain without being a parachain on Kusama first, Kusama parachain slots are cheap but there are also some projects already with slots that have no working product to date and have minimal (<20) transactions per day.
    - If we were to try and become a Kusama parachain it may devalue the Joystream project by making it look like it is similar to early stage projects when Joystream is actually already pretty feature complete, has been through 13 testnets etc.
- One positive aspect of becoming a parachain is that it would increase awareness of the project, however the Polkadot community is relatively small and a little insular. This doesn’t mean there would be no benefit seen but it is perhaps arguable that reaching content creators as a use of resources would have better returns.
- One positive aspect of becoming a parachain is the potential access to dotsama treasury for funding improvements to Joystream (if it were a parachain). While this is true, dotsama governance is going through a lot of changes at the moment and many funding proposals are being rejected, even by long term contributors.
    - To add to this, we do not currently have any reputation with dotsama so would be taking some risk in thinking we would even be able to apply for funding for anything.
    - The $DOT token holders seem very concerned with the value of $DOT and seem apprehensive to fund things with unknown returns - this is more pronounced especially recently
- If we were to aim at becoming a parachain we would at minimum need:
    - A firm decision from the council/Joystream community to decide whether this move would be desired
    - Engagement with the dotsama community + successful parachains to understand how to best go about it and to field feedback on any potential issues
    - A runtime upgrade to be developed, tested, proposed and implemented (2-3 months at minimum)
    - Various changes to our current apps (Pioneer, Atlas) to have support for the increased finalization time (it will go from ~12s > 60s) (some of this is already being done)
    - Discussion and agreement on our parachain proposal/offer - this must be fully fleshed out, written well and ready for presentation. It has a **large** impact on tokenomics.
    - Marketing materials to support our parachain bid
    - Finances to support the Parachain bid
        - This may require engagement/support of outside entities

# **Why Nodle didn’t choose to secure a parachain on Kusama**

Nodle was among the first solo chains to launch into production using Parity Substrate. Maintaining and developing a chain was a big effort, and having two production environments didn’t make sense for us. We therefore developed a testnet named [Arcadia](https://nodle.medium.com/announcing-nodles-arcadia-blockchain-testnet-bringing-you-a-more-secure-and-faster-blockchain-faf67801b687) that helps us test upgrades before we push them to the Nodle Chain in the production environment. Once we get a parachain on Polkadot, it will be our only production environment. On top of that, Polkadot is better audited and more production-ready than Kusama, which means it can provide us with better security and performance guarantees.
