# YPP Rewards Payout ending 20.10

<aside>
💡 Happy Friday yall

Its been two weeks since we’ve release YPP 2.0, and the results are pretty impressive. 

We’ve added more than 1k channels over the last week with a total count of 3658 channels in the program with a total YT followers count of 38 mln!! 

Also worth mentioning that we’ve retrospectively upgraded the rewards for Bronze tier to be 2$ per sign up and 1$ for referral of such channel. If you are still not sure what that means, you are welcome to read the tiers explanation [in the Program Details](../../YouTube%20Partner%20Program%20Outline%20d492c2eb88ff4ace955b5f2902ec21fb.md).

In the meantime we are working on releasing the referrals landing page, early next week which will help to get the info across easier. 

Watch this space for more info next week!
