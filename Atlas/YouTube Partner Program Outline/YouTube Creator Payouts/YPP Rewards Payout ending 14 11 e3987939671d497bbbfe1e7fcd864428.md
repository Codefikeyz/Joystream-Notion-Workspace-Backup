# YPP Rewards Payout ending 14.11

<aside>
💡 We are starting the new payout cadence, and from now on the YPP reward payments will be done every Tuesday. 

Thank you all for your patience while we were dealing with the update of sync service, as the number of channels surpassed 10k the technical optimisation was required. Now carried out successfully excited to announce the latest status. 

Over the last 10 days we have added 3.2k channels, now total channels count in the program is 11.2k!  80% of new channels come from referrals so great to see us growing from within. 

By the way, we’ve released a new [referrals landing page](https://gleev.xyz/referrals), which explains the details of the referrals scheme. Check it out if not already and make sure to share it - everyone who has channel on Gleev can use the referrals program!
