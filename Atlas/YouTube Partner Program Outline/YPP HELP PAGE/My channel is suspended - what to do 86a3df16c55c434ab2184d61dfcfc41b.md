## Reasons for suspension

Here is the list of suspended reasons that are currently defined

`CopyrightBreach` - when YT channel reposts videos from other channels or creators. 
`MisleadingContent` - when creators are promoting content of questionable integrity, like deposit/ pyramid schemes and ml marketing. Or simply when thumbnails, channel description etc do not match with the playback content. 
`UnsupportedTopic` - Gore, violence, porn, all the categories that are in severe violation of [terms of service](https://gleev.xyz/legal/tos)
`ProgramTermsExploit` - purchased subscribers, comments and views by bots, or channels created with the aim to exploit the rewards program. For example channel has no videos or only 1 video uploaded recently. 

## What can I do?

Decision about channel suspended is non-negotiable and cannot be revisited. Sync videos for suspended channels are not supported, however such channels can still benefit from the referrals scheme, which is open for all.
