# YouTube Partner Program Outline

YouTube Partner Programme (YPP) is targeted at creators that already have a YouTube channel with substantial content and subscribers count. The program is active in Gleev.xyz App and operated by JS Genesis, the founding company behind Joystream platform. The key focus of the programme is to simplify the creator sign up and syncing existing content to Gleev channel. The programme rewards creators whose YT channels meet the qualification criteria for signing up,  weekly content sync and referrals of other creators to Gleev.

## How to sign up

In order to sign up, one needs to visit [gleev.xyz/ypp](http://gleev.xyz/ypp), choose “sign up with Google” and follow the onboarding flow.

### **Google Auth**

Creators covering any topic are welcome to sign up, and Gleev supports a broad set of content categories. The program welcomes genuine creators who are frequently posting original content to their YT channel, and do not have subscribers and views purchased by bots.

During the sign up, creators need to authorise with the Google Account, connected to their YouTube channel. During the authorisation, backend application g*leev-creators* operated by JS Genesis needs to be granted access to 

- Email address for the Google account connected with YouTube channel that gets connected from [`user.email`](http://user.email) scope
- `user.id` from `user.profile`  scope for authentication
- YT content, `youtube.readonly`  scope, to fetch channel meta data, content information and enable the sync service

<aside>
💡 Make sure you select Youtube readonly scope as this is required to check your channel’s qualification criteria!

## Auto-sync service

In order to simplify the upload of content to Gleev App, JS Genesis team has built a dedicated backend application, integrated with Youtube and Gleev to facilitate the content upload. It is hosted on the JSGenesis operated infrastructure and operated by JS Genesis team.

This requests access to the necessary information via YT API, namely `read_only` scope to your YouTube channel data. This happens during the authorisation flow as part of the YPP programme onboarding. The App fetches only the information that YT exposes in the `read_only` scope and required to effectively operate the programme via the open API.

Account Info: email address.
Channel Info: name, date created, URL, number of followers, number of comments, number of views, number of videos,
Videos info: video titles, videos date uploaded, video subtitles.

Sync status is displayed in the creator channel dashboard. Once the place in the queue reaches 1, syncing for the channel starts.

![Screenshot 2023-10-09 at 13.39.03.png](YouTube%20Partner%20Program%20Outline/Screenshot_2023-10-09_at_13.39.03.png)

### Sync limits

After sign up each channel has an allowance of 5 latest videos synced before the verification by the YPP team is done and the YPP tier is assigned. After verification additional videos will be synced:

- Max of 5 videos OR 1 GB for channel with **bronze** tier (no additional syncing)  🥉
- Max of 100 videos OR 10 GB for channel with **silver** tier 🥈
- Max of 250 videos OR 100 GB for channel with **gold** tier 🥇
- Max of 1000 videos OR 1 TB  for channel with with **diamond** **tier** 💎

⚠️ For any channel max size of a single synced video is 15 GB

⚠️ For any channel max duration of synced video is 3 hrs

### Videos polling

If auto-sync service is enabled, it will refetch channel information and poll videos to add to the queue not less frequent than once every 24 hours.

Only public videos are synced. Videos are synced in resolution of 720px or lower. HD videos will be supported as the programme matures. Subtitles synced only in English, and all other languages are not supported at the time of programme launch, but will be supported in the future.  The queue of syncing is defined based on the proprietary algorithm developed and maintained by JSGenesis team.

**License**

****Auto-sync service will read the videos meta-data fields, including title, description, date created, duration, language and license and transfer them to the newly created video on the creators Joystream channel. 

In case the original youtube video license was set to Standard-Youtube-License, such videos will be assigned Joystream-license, limiting the replication and usage of such content without the explicit consent of the author. 

In case the original youtube video license was set to Creative Commons, such videos will be assigned CC0 license, allowing all viewers to distribute such videos freely in the public domain, allowing them to be built upon, enhanced and reused by others for any purpose without restrictions. 

License can be updated manually for each videos individually from the list of available options. 

## Opt out

Channel can stop the auto-sync feature by choosing this option in the settings tab of the YPP dashboard. Opting out from Auto-sync would stop automated upload of all new content published to YT channel.

Opting out from the entire programme can also be done from the settings tab. This will result the channel marked in the internal data base as "opted-out" and payout calculation for this channel will stop for any activities undertaken.

Already uploaded content will remain on the platform but can be deleted by the user at any time.
