# Approaching testing in Atlas

# 1. Create a GitHub issue

Create a GitHub *Test card* issue to keep everyone in the loop on things like what do you want to test, how do you want to test it, and — once you’ve gathered data — what are the key findings and what are your recommendations.

You can use this issue as a template: https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/2000 

Once you’ve filled out the first three sections, let Dmitry know and wait for his green light to proceed.

# 2. Set up a Calendly event

Set up your [Calendly.com](http://Calendly.com) account, if you haven’t already. Create a new One-on-One event and fill out the event details using the template below.

# 3. Recruit participants

> *You can learn valuable things by asking the right people the wrong questions. If you’re talking to the wrong people, it doesn’t matter what you ask. Bad participants can undermine everything you’re trying to do.*

## Screening

Depending on the subject of your study, you might want to look for specific types of participants. For example, if you’re doing a usability test on creating playlists, you might want to look for people that are experienced in creating online video content.

For this reason, it is highly advisable for you to screen your candidates first, using a simple Google Form. 

If this is your first screener, you can [use this screener as a template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19h7K2JC1LhyLs7lO6AscoJ_gKcY_qi0_9ZW-erA-Ru4/edit) to get you started.

## Candidates

Depending on what types of participants you’re looking for, consider using different communication channels. In Atlas, so far we’ve been using:

| Communication channel | Who can you find there? |
| --- | --- |
| [](../Tests%20&%20Research/Testers%204ecaa0a1b1c14135aafaade99bf23caa.md)  | Our internal database of test subjects we conducted studies on in the past. |
| [#user-testing on Joystream’s Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/943583827752812605) & mention **@atlas-tester,**

Optionally, use the below channels too:
#general on Joystream’s Discord | A very engaged community of Joystream’s early adopters. Can be expected to be familiar with the app, the basic concepts of crypto, and NFTs. Known issues with candidates from this group are: sometimes poor English knowledge, not showing up for scheduled events, some folks tend to be overly opinionated on matters that are not part of the study. |
| [Netguru only]  [#user-testing Slack channel](https://netguru.slack.com/archives/C56RWH2K0) | A large group of Netguru employees/contractors willing to help with all kinds of usability tests. A wide variety of people with vastly different backgrounds, all somewhat connected with the world of IT. Candidates in this group can be expected to have good communication skills and to be reliable when it comes to scheduling. |
| [Netguru only]  [#nft Slack channel](https://netguru.slack.com/archives/C03085Z29V5) & [#crypro Slack channel](https://netguru.slack.com/archives/C5VL13YQ0) | A group of Netguru employees/contractors interested in the topics of crypto and NFTs in general. |
| Twitter |  |

## Invitation templates

„Be vague about the contents of the actual test. If you recruit people from the site you are testing, then just refer to “an interview about this website.”

# 4. Conduct the test

# 5. Raport the results

---

1. Find participants:
    1. Make sure you know who you’re looking for and based on that you use different comunication channels and update your communication accordingly,
    2. Send an email to yourself, while pasting the list of participant emails in the BCC field. 
        
        [](../Tests%20&%20Research/Testers%204ecaa0a1b1c14135aafaade99bf23caa.md) 
        
    3. Use the template below:
2. Conduct the test:
    1. If possible (but highly recommended) find a buddy to make notes for you, so that you can focus on conducting the test,
    2. While conducting the test, you can use (but don’t have to) the following template to guide you: [(Test template) **Name surname , Date, Hour** ](../Tests%20&%20Research/(Test%20template)%20Name%20surname%20,%20Date,%20Hour%2055180cfae753470081baf5fd16c0b83b.md) 
    3. Mention recording and the Google Drive folder,
3. Update your GitHub test card issue:
    1. Outline the outcome (key findings),
    2. List your recomendations,
    3. List all testers to be paid, using their polkadot wallet address,
