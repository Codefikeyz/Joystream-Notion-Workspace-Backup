### Invitation for a screening survey

Hi there! **@here**

The Joystream :joystream: design team strikes again! This time we're working on *[a vague description of what is being tested]* and we'd love to get your feedback on it! :fire:

:man_raising_hand_tone1: **Okay, how can I help?**

All you need to do is fill out the form below (2-3 minutes) and wait for us to get back to you. 
*[link to a google form with your screening survey]*

:moneybag: **What will I get for doing that?**

This time we'll be contacting a few selected participants, but if we manage to do a *[15/30/45/60]*-minute session to go through a prototype we put together, we’d love to give you $30 worth of tJOY as a thank you for your contribution to the project.

See you there!
