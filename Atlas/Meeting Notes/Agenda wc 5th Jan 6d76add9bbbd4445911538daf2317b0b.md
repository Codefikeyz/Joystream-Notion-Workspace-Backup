# Agenda

- [x]  Review [to-dos from last week](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/1539)
- [x]  Discuss @Netguru Design team struggles with Vercel and not being able to test the “production data” (also: letting the design team know once the implementation is ready to be reviewed),
    - Not Vercel issue,
    - There is a difference in how we fetch data from production,
    - Plan is to be fixed next week (Wed?).
- [x]  Discuss technical challenges around Notifications and possible ways out:
    - [x]  having unread notifications,
    - [x]  deleting/hiding notifications.
    - Give up on the deleting options
    - Have all notifications unread by default, when opening
- [ ]  @Netguru Design (Kuba) to present findings & recomendations for the issuing NFT flow based on the recent usability tests,
