# How would you describe this user as a tester?

Jenny knows how to do stuff but she expresses herself like she is really new to this. This gives away a vibe of a person less tech-savvy, but on top of that, she can really well express her thoughts and construct feedback. She is an ideal candidate for tests for non-expert user persona.
