# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    Yes, I did
    

- [x]  Have you participated in that kind of test before?

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    I see additional category payment
    
    I guess this is category related to creator token
    
    we can see history of our transactions
    
    AR - refers to rewards my channel got
    
    ETA - schedule of payouts
    
     Channel balance - JOY balance
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    button is visible
    
    its transferred to balance
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you know how much in total you’ve received from the council? How much was that?
- I don’t know it’s from the council
- probably this money is coming from smart contract over my channel or from maybe creator token sales or NFT sales
- if there’s no tooltip, i wouldn’t know that

- [ ]  What do you think happened to the rest of the tokens?
- [ ]  Was everything clear for you?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Task 3: Please tell me, do you know when exactly is the next reward going to take place? When?**
- Notes
    - less than three days

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    I believe yes, it is useful
    
    - If it’s like this it sometimes can be random
    - why this is not regular?
    - 

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    tries to find it in transaction history
    
    - I was expecting it because rewards are transactions, and I would like to see that in my history

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Was that information in a place you would expect it to be?
- [ ]  Do you find that information useful?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Q: Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience on this page?**
- Notes
