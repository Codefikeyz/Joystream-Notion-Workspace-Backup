# 3. Task

    - Notes
        
        Normally outside of video platform, in adobe premiere
        Clisk on show more to see if there are anything about subtitles
        Notices video language
        Closes the show more and reads there should be subtitles there
        Would it be caption?
        Caption could be a subtitles but could be a text that could be embeded in the video
        But why certification?
        She clarifies that under show more there is subtitles and she didn’t find it under there
        Lets select a language 
        Even i add a language where do I go from here
        It confuses her that she does not have any way to proceed
        She would try to retry or seek help on forums, editor
        I instructed her to click next 
        She knows she can upload a file 
        She does not understand how it works
        She didn’t understand where is the time for the subtitles
        There is a learning curve to this subtitles
        We try to upload a file and get a msg 
        Unable to parse selected file
        

How was it for you:

- We hardly succeded - its complicated , it would be very flustrating to do this on my own
