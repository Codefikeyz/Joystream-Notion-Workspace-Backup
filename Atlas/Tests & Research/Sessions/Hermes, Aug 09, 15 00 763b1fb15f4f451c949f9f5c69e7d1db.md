Token ticker is not clear but guess correctly

Patronage is a little confusing 

He does not know if tokens are going to him or to community

He thinks that it could apply to both him and holders

Needs dollar conversion in summary

Preview token page as an option on page 

Edit the token page first would be the first action that he does after 

While editing token page we have to have a minimum content page probably already previewed for the user to show that there doesn’t have to be a lot of work done to start

He is confused about the area on the left - he thought those are clues

He is confused about AMM and says that this would be more complex
Since I’m not familiar with how AMM works I would choose Public sale

he doesn’t see much value in area on the left - preview in sale

He would like to have standard and custom options for terms and conditions

He would like to have a modal with success after setting up sale

He says that AMM description is confusing (value if there is more tokens should be decreasing not increasing)

He would like learn more to be higher and easier to spot to learn more
