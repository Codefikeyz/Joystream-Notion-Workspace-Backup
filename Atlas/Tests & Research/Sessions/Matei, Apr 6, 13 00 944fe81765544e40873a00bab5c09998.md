# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    I haven't.❌
    

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [x]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    We are in payments section so probably something about payment in product
    Its something about money
    Is it about people paying for the vide?
    Reads instruction in tooltips
    Goes from left to right and analyse
    Looking at revenue yeah now I can see it
    Its NFT sale
    Royalty you will get that when something of your NFT sold
    We have filters for the page it show us all possibilities for making income here
    We have some notifications
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    Hover the claim reward immidiatelly
    Reads the whole tooltip
    OK click the button
    Reads the transaction fee 
    The full amount is selected 
    Signed transaction 
    The animation is kind of dope!
    OK so now we have a channel balance and we can withdraw it
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you know how much in total you’ve received from the council? How much was that?
- Notes
    
    Tells the 700K joystream tokens but asks what the hell is the council.
    When asked about more he told about 900. I received 770k because 
    
- [ ]  Was everything clear for you?
- Notes
    
    Everything went smooth and really fast no issues at all.
    
    Notices that the number of the reward is also in the transaction history
    If it would be you have available this amount and claimable this ammount
    Because when I click on claim I believed the 900 was max for me to withdraw
    (Co się dzieje z resztą hajsu którego nie wypłaciłeś)
    
- [ ]  **Task 3: Please tell me, do you know when exactly is the next reward going to take place? When?**
- Notes
    
    I think the sign is wrong here because it means it would be over 3 days
    It should be less than 3 days
    
    ![Untitled](Matei,%20Apr%206,%2013%2000/Untitled.png)
    
    If we don't know - is there a way of knowing what is the max 
    If you know 14 days is max then put under 14 days 
    
    Can show the list of council meetings and then you will know when the decision for the exact time can come
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    He said that there is 200 k token more for him to withdraw
    Correctly points to the rest of the money
    Cant find see history immidiatelly
    Now the button is called last rewadrs
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Was that information in a place you would expect it to be?
- [ ]  Do you find that information useful?
- Notes
    
    T: Explains what its all about
    Yeah but not convinced in voice
    You can it here 
    Advices to connect both tables - just click on one of them and it will expand with 
    
    IF it would filter it this way it would be very easy to get all information and all in one place
    

- [ ]  **Q: Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience on this page?**
- Notes
    
    Nothing is really confusing 
    Now goes ahead and tests witdrawal
    Considers about transaction fee for withdrawal and wanders about the fee is it fixed
    I would expect it to withdraw it to a wallet that supports joystream
    Tells about cross-chain feature to send money across chains
