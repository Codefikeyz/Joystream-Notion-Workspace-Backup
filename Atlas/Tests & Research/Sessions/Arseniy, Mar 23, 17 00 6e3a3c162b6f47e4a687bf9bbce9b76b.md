# 2. Task & Questions

- [x]  Do you know webvtt format?
- Note
    
    No, I cannot remember file type like this.
    

- [x]  Did you add subtitles to any video in the past?
- Notes
    
    Only added subtitles with me srt on previous test
    
    And srt to simple videos
    

- [x]  What are closed captions?
- Notes
    
    “It’s like separating of subtitle to very each timeline” (? - Tomek)
    
    “Without googling it I wouldn’t add anything” - I think he mixed some concepts 😅
    

- [ ]  **(Task 1) Add Spanish subtitles to your new video & mark them as closed captions**
    - Notes
        
        User starts to read everything, then finds more settings, starts to read about licence/content rating etc
        
        Very user friendly it was my first thought what to click to find “mark as closed captions”.
        
    
- [ ]  **(Task 2) You forgot that the subtitles that you created do not contain Audio description - please correct that**
    - Notes
        
        It’s very easy. It’s good. 
        
    
- [ ]  **(Task 3) Add english subtitles**
    - Notes
        
        No problems whatsoever. 
        
        I need to remove the first one
        
        ahh, maybe I just have to just click select file. That would be my first thought. The second thought would be to remove current subtitles, and then upload new ones.
        

- [ ]  How was it for you to add subtitles this way:
- Notes
    
    You know, I just tried to choose the best option between youtube and this prototype. According to usability this prototype is much better, easier, and better for newbies and elder ones because it asks you to just click 2 buttons. I think it’s good. It’s sounds that there are no obstacles to add subtitles for each video and it’s no problem for me.
    
    Take CC outside context menu so I don’t have to click 2 times.
