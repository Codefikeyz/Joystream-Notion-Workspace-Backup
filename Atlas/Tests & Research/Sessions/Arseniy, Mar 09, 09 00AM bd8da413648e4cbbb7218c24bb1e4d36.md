# 3. Task

- [ ]  **(Task 1) Create a new video and add subtitle file to it**
    - Notes
        
        Clicks create and upload video
        Selects the video
        There is some kind of details
        and title I will leave a title like this
        Need to type something in description
        Clicks next
        Notices that there is add subtitles but its diabled
        He is confised
        He went all the way to the end
        Left the stage where I can set subtitles 
        I cant understand why there is no option to click a button to add subtitles
        Tries adding cards
        Resign at this time
        If he would be alone he would google it how it can be done
        I advise him to hover the add button
        He did not find that he has to select language
        He finds language
        Certificate none its true
        And finally we have an option to add subtitles
        First of all I need to upload file
        Let it be with timing
        I see visions of subtitles
        And I can click done here
        
        Looks for adding a subtitle on video
        Thinks its a good way to delete it and upload again
        
        When I show him the subtitles menu 
        He notices how he can edit his existing caption, and download and clear
        Hovers over 
        
        It looks comlicated it absolutely hidden
        

How was it for you:

It looks weird and its complicated, 

Closed captions and subtitles
Closed captions just a part of full subtitles it means a text with sounds
