# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. Creating token

- [x]  Please create your own channel token & as you go describe for me how you understand all concepts that will be presented to you on each screen
- Notes
    - Looking at the left-hand sidebar now… (He’s not an Atlas user, he sees everything for the very first time).
    - Ok, I’m going to hit “Create your token”, or no… Wait, I’ll hit “Learn more” first. That’s what I would do, expecting to see some video tutorials, perhaps some short “10x” format instructions kind of a thing, with some icons and some graphics and stuff.
    - **Step 1:**
        - Looking at the bottom left, at the fee…
        - Then I’m looking at the left panel, at the “This token is not verified yet”, and then there’s a revenue split. Wait, what’s the 80% for the channel? Oh, wait, it makes sense. It’s a video channel. Now it makes sense.
        - **I’d probably go to “Learn more” again, just to make sure I’m not screwing anything up. Obviously. Just like with BitClout. Yeah, I think tutorials are very important with stuff like that.**
        - Establishing proper tokenomics from the very beginning is extremely important, and that’s what I would look for here.
        - Ok, then there’s permission type… That’s cool. I thought a lot about that. I like to control who gets to have my coin. It takes a lot of effort from me to keep my “cap table clean”. So that’s why I think whitelist would be a great option.
        - (Quickly skims through “Revenue split”, saying okay).
    - **Step 2:**
        - Time-bound token scheme. I like that.
        - Ok, I’m going to read a little bit (reads).
        - Yeah, I think this would be really cool. I think people on DeSo would love this. I love it. Tools like this are highly wanted. I would try to use it.
        - So the huge discussion right now is “how do you sell your own tokens without looking like a jerk”. Some kind of education on this screen would be great.
        - The graph makes understanding it super easy.
        - I see the dots on the chart and suspect this is when next chunks of tokens will be released to me.
    - **Step 3:**
        - Ok, so this is the token summary.
        - (Skims through the summary quickly)
        - Yup, this looks good.
        - (Confirms token creation)
        - (Then he made some interesting comment about the token page which I didn’t capture)
        - 

## 2. Token dashboard

- [x]  What would be the next action that you would take right now?
- Notes
    - Usually I try to scroll through whole pages just to see what I’m getting into.
    - Then I try to make sure I understand all the stats.
    - Ok, token holders — this is cool. Like a graphical representation of who holds my token.
    - **Transactions — ooooooh, this would be amazing!**
    - Ok, now I would go back up and try to become a Token Master. So I would hit “Edit” (token page) and then put my token on sale.
- [x]  Please analyze the whole page and describe to me how you understand the concepts presented on it
- Notes
    
    *Notes above*
    

## 3. Edit the token page

- [x]  Edit your token page. Add a video intro, one benefit, description and publish it.
- Notes
    - (Tries to click on everything. Unfortunately, none of the elements he clicks on are interactive)
    - (Then he proceeds to select a video trailer) **So I guess I would pick my most watched video here.**
    - Then, let’s see… Benefits, oh cool! So like a real utility.
    - Ok, so I added my description.
    - Alright, before I publish I usually review everything (scrolls to the top of the page). Ok, looks good, so I’m going to hit “Publish”.
    - Alright, now I’m going to move on to my token sale and then move on to the rev split.

## 4. Sales

- [x]  Please tell me what the differences between public sale and AMM and how you understand it
- Notes
    - I’m guessing the creator sale is like I’m selling tokens that are already minted. And it would be cool if I could have things like bidding, and basically whatever settings I want. Versus AMM, which is what we have now, which would be kind of limited, but would be automatic.
    - I guess I would go through this chart (table) and let’s see… One UI suggestion would be to move check and cross icons to the middle of the column, so that it’s easier to scan visually.
    - Just because I know what I know I would be curious to know why it says I can’t get revenue with the AMM.
    - Liquidity, ok, Urgency, ok, o a deadline — like that!
    - I can’t select Creator sale because I’m cliffed.

### AMM

- [x]  Sell your token on AMM and describe to me every concept that is presented to you and how you understand it
- Notes
    - **Step 1:**
        - Ok, let’s see.
        - Starting price is clear. 1 JOY is $2, that’s clear.
        - Terms & Conditions… Yeah, if they’re not too crazy I try to read terms & conditions. Oh, you can actually change them.
    - **Step 2:**
        - I love this. I understand this is for my buyers’.
    - **Step 3:**
        - Ok, everything looks very straightforward, so I’m going to go ahead and start sale.

## Final

- [x]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask about?
- Notes
    - Yeah, being able to end sale would be cool.
    - “Sold to AMM” was not clear to me instantly. Perhaps I would rename it to “Resold to AMM”? I don’t know…

# 5. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Thank the participant and request the wallet address

15:00 - how zach understand the starting tokens 

Rename ok in dialog to go to dashboard

Next action would be to edit

25:30 - sale types
28:05 - curious why he does not earn money from AMM

Setting custom starting price for AMM is confusing - why isn’t it just set for me 

Patronage - not clear
