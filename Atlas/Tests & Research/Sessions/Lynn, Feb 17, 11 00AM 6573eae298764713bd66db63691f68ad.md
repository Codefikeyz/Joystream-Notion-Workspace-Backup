# 2. Intro to the app

<aside>
⚠️ Only for the participants who said they’re not familiar with the app OR they’re not familiar with web3 concepts

</aside>

- [x]  Joystream is a video platform controlled, owned and operated by its users,
- [x]  The video platform is based on blockchain & what does it mean,
- [x]  Show the Polkadot extension:
    - [x]  *To manage your blockchain account, you will need a Polkadot browser,*
    - [x]  *There’s no password to your Joystream membership, there’s a Polkadot extension.*
- [x]  Go through the flow of uploading a video and demonstrate how information are stored on the blockchain,
- [x]  Ask for questions.
- **Notes**
    
    “Everything is understandable”
    

# 3. Tasks

- [x]  Introduction:
    - [x]  Share a link to a Figma prototype, explain the technical details,
    - [x]  Explain what is the subject of the study,
    - [x]  *Imagine yourself just joined the platform and found an interesting video you’d like to comment for the very first time. There are a couple of tasks we would like you to perform to see if the UI is intuitive and clear enough.*
    - [x]  Mention acting like we’re not here,
    - [x]  Mention thinking-aloud protocol,
    - [x]  Mention that it’s the prototype that’s being tested, not the test subject,
    - [x]  Mention that we’re not looking for flattering answers.
    - Notes
- [x]  **(Task 1) Add a comment in the main thread**
*Can I ask you to simply add a new comment under the video? Say “I like this video a lot!”
Heads up: Because it’s a Figma prototype, comments are going to be prepopulated.*
    - Notes
        
        OK so i click the button
        
        then it said continue in polkadot
        
        then it open the transaction modal
        
        I have to put password and sign
        And then I have posted it
        That was alright - it was easy because it was all automatic
        It would be annoying to do all of that [passwords, przyp: Adam] manually
        I would be supprised if you havent told me that it is supposed to happen [if I didn’t know about the Polkadot extension, przyp: Adam]
        
- [x]  **Task 2: Add a reply to a comment that already has some replies**
*Can I ask you to add a comment as a reply to the acuate_anton’s comment? Say “good points!”*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks reply
        OK good points comment
        This one was also easy
        Whenever I hovered the comment I saw the reply button and it was easy to reply
        Sometimes you want to reply to the original comment
        
- [x]  **Task 3: Add a reply to a reply**
*Can I ask you to add a reply to bittyarlen’s comment?*
    - Notes
    The oldest one is on the top
    I expected my reply to be below the reply that I replied to
    You could get lost to which comment somebody replied
    - Youtube
    As far as I remember you cannot do multiple comments
    It opens only that thread
        
        
- [x]  **Task 4: Adding reactions**
*Can you see the comment from the member named abrupt_tammy (2nd from the top)? How do you think other people feel about this comment? Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction to it?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 1: Undoing a reaction**
    *If you were to change your mind and wanted to undo this reaction, do you think you can do that? How would you do that?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 2: Adding a new reaction**
    *Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction once again, but this time to the comment below, from the user called “morniniglikesbar”?*
    - Notes
        
        Somebody complemented him before - maybe it is his video
        Some people liked it and one person found it irrelevant
        I would expect to click on heart to add it like on slack
        Or emoji icon and add from there
        Okay I got some information got it ( When dialog opens)
        
        OK its done
        
        I didn’t realized that I would have to sign all my actions on that website
        
        It was alright
        
        I was supprised that this time I got the information and before I haven’t when I was commenting
        So I clicked on the emoji on the right one and then I click the heart
        This was clear
        

# 4. Questions

- [x]  **Question 1: Sorting**
*How do you think comments are sorted right now? Do you think you can change that? How do you thank would affect the comments you added?*
    - Notes
        
        “From the oldest to the newest”
        Not really actually
        
        4 days 3 days 4 hours
        looks like random
        The ones that are interacted the most would be on the top
        
        Do you think you can change the way
        I dont see the option
        I see most popular so I can change it
        To be honest I would expect most popular button below secttion where I can comment
        
- [x]  **Question 2: Commenting**
*Based on this prototype, how often would you imagine yourself commenting videos in Atlas, compared to how often you currently comment videos on YouTube or other social media platforms, in general? Less often, more often, or would it be about the same?*
    - Notes
        
        I think it would be the same because its all about the video
        It is irrelevant unless you have to type password manually each time but it is not the case here
        
- [x]  **Question 3: Reactions**
*Imagine that YouTube introduces reactions to comments in the same way you just experienced it in the prototype. How would that affect how often you react to other people's comments: less often, or more often, or would it stay the same? Why?*
    - Notes
        
        I think it would be the same frequency as today
        I dont like reading comments because it almost always a quarrel
        I do that only if the video is touching
        
- [x]  **Question 4: Unlimited reactions**
- *Which reactions system do you see yourself using more often, compared to each other?
- Which option makes it easier for you to quickly see how do people feel about different comments?*
    - Notes
        
        The B one - it looks more interesting
        Also in a past years people started using more emojis on everyday basis 
        People use different emojis and would love it
        
        A - Because you have less options - what bannana would mean 
        

### Unexpected questions scenario

In case the participant asks about a feature that was not included in the scope, the following questions should be used:

1. Is this something you would expect to be able to do?
2. Would the lack of this feature somehow affected your willingness to use the commenting system on Atlas?

# 5. Wrap-up

- [x]  Open mic. Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience with comments on Atlas?
- [x]  Ask for a Polkadot wallet address, or a Joystream member handle/ID.
- [x]  Thank the participant for taking part in the study and ask if we can reach out in the future.
