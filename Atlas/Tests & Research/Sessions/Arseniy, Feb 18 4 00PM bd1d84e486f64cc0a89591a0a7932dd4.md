- [ ]  Ask for questions.
- Notes
    
    

# 3. Tasks & questions

- [x]  **Introduction:**
    - [x]  Share a link to a Figma prototype, explain the technical details,
    - [x]  Explain what is the subject of the study,
    - [x]  *Imagine yourself just joined the platform and found an interesting video you’d like to comment for the very first time. There are a couple of tasks we would like you to perform to see if the UI is intuitive and clear enough.*
    - [x]  Mention acting like we’re not here,
    - [x]  Mention thinking-aloud protocol,
    - [x]  Mention that it’s the prototype that’s being tested, not the test subject,
    - [x]  Mention that we’re not looking for flattering answers.
    - Notes
        
        It seems very familiar because I always read those kind of comments on youtube 
        
- [x]  **Question 1: Sorting**
*1. How do you think comments are sorted right now?
2. Do you think you can change that?
3. How do you thank would affect the comments you added?*
    - Notes
        
        He points to three kinds of sorting
        I think its in most popular mode
        Points out that the amount of reactions = the order of comments
        
        The sorting option looks very obvious and it was the first button that my eyes laid on
        
        I think that the best way to show my new comment would be to see it right on the top, but for other users it would be more appropriate if my comment would appear accordingly to their mode of sorting
        
        Explains all three modes of sorting one by one and he gets it right
        
- [x]  **Task 1: Add a comment in the main thread**
*Can I ask you to simply add a new comment under the video? Say “I like this video a lot!”
Heads up: Because it’s a Figma prototype, comments are going to be prepopulated.*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks on the text area field
        Hovers over the text  next to information
        Hits the comment button
        Signs the transaction
        Yeah its preety simple, yes it includes the signing on blockchain because we are on dao project, its preety simple every user should proceed through it right away
        Not a surprise to sign transaction because i sign comments on JS forum so Im used to it
        
- [x]  **Task 2: Add a reply to a comment that already has some replies**
*Can I ask you to add a comment as a reply to the acuate_anton’s comment? Say “good points!”*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks reply
        Yeah its done its very simple
        Its just like an ordinary leaving comment on youtube + just a transaction on blockchain 
        But its alright because we are on decentralized platform
        When I imagined leaving replies I imagined something exactly like this 100% like I imagined it
        
- [x]  **Task 3: Add a reply to a reply**
*Can I ask you to add a reply to bittyarlen’s comment?*
    - Notes
        
        OK yeah its done
        As I see it its designed in a very proper way 
        At the beginning I can see the user mentioned - I like it
        Each user can easily find the full dialogue between users
        I think its alright
        I can easily find the nickname by this purple coloring of mentioned person
        
        EDIT DELETE question
        I have no idea where is the delete button
        In blockchain there is no executed idea of deletion
        Yeah I expected to see a cross button which would allow me to fast delete my comment
        I would want it to be added
        
- [x]  **Question 2: Commenting**
*Based on this prototype, how often would you imagine yourself commenting videos in Atlas, compared to how often you currently comment videos on YouTube or other social media platforms, in general? Less often, more often, or would it be about the same?*
    - Notes
        
        I think that it would be equal 
        I would like to comment only if this video contains some usefull information and I have questions to that video
        Im not such a person who likes to express emotions
        Only questions for getting new specific information
        So the frequency would be the same
        
- [x]  **Task 4: Adding reactions**
*Can you see the comment from the member named abrupt_tammy (2nd from the top)? How do you think other people feel about this comment? Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction to it?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 1: Undoing a reaction**
    *If you were to change your mind and wanted to undo this reaction, do you think you can do that? How would you do that?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 2: Adding a new reaction**
    *Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction once again, but this time to the comment below, from the user called “morniniglikesbar”?*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks on heart
        Reads the dialog
        OK
        Proceeds, ofcourse
        Its done
        Thank you for information table because I think that some group of users will be “fascinated” with the fact that they need to sign the reaction
        I was prepared for that
        I have no strong feelings - I got the information
        
        When I clicked again to remove it matched 100% my expectation
        
        I think I need to click on smile button and I choose the heart
        Its familiar with skype they did reactions the same way
        Its preety simple and friendly
        
- [x]  **Question 3: Reactions**
*Imagine that YouTube introduces reactions to comments in the same way you just experienced it in the prototype. How would that affect how often you react to other people's comments: less often, or more often, or would it stay the same? Why?*
    - Notes
        
        It may be
        Clciking on reaction can be a way to show my emotions/feelings and do it very fast
        I would do it more frequently than commenting
        I do not remember if youtube allows user to reacts to comments
        
- [x]  **Question 4: Unlimited reactions**
*1. Which reactions system do you see yourself using more often, compared to each other?
2. How do you think people feel like about the first comment, based on two versions?
3. Which option makes it easier for you to quickly see how do people feel about different comments?*
    - Notes
        
        I would go with option A
        Option B has too much emojis
        I sometimes hate discord becaues there is a lot of emojis and reactions
        Because I have a cristal vision of liking vs disliking 
        

### Unexpected questions scenario

In case the participant asks about a feature that was not included in the scope, the following questions should be used:

1. Is this something you would expect to be able to do?
2. Would the lack of this feature somehow affected your willingness to use the commenting system on Atlas?

# 4. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Open mic. Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience with comments on Atlas?
- [ ]  Ask for a Polkadot wallet address, or a Joystream member handle/ID.
- [ ]  Thank the participant for taking part in the study and ask if we can reach out in the future.
