- **Notes**
    
     
    

# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. A/B

- [x]  Please dont click anything for now and focus on layout - which one of the two makes it easy for you to scan the page?

### Full

- Notes
    
    I prefer the first one. It looks better. I prefer everything.
    

### Few

- Notes
    
    I guess with less content I prefer the 2nd option, it looks better.
    

### Empty

- Notes
    
    Surprisingly, I like the first one better. XD When there’s too little content it looks to empty.
    

## 2. Describe

- [x]  What is the most important information that youre looking for when you open a token page?
- Notes
    
    I guess I don’t really know what the Rev Split is… But I guess I would be looking at that. 
    
    Token price. Of course, price of the bounding curve (?) is something you want to know.
    
    Total revenue — because you want your fav artist to be making as much as possible.
    
    Volume would be very important.
    
- [x]  Please describe everything that you see and how you understand while browsing this page - you can click now
- Notes
    
    I guess video stands out. It’s nice to know the artist so I would prob watch the video.
    
    Then I would be prob look for the verification info on the left-hand side.
    
    Sale type is also interesting. 
    
    The total supply would be very important too.
    
    I would prob notice statistics after that.
    
    And then I would prob jump over to the benefits, if I would be interested in knowing more about them. “Free tickets” — that would be very cool. These perks are cool.
    
    Then I would prob look at the holders to see if I recognize anyone and see what is their share.
    
    And then, lastly, I would jump back to the main column to watch some more videos.
    

## 3. Page elements

- [x]  Now we will take a closer look at some of the elements on the page

### Token header

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element?
- Notes
    
    I guess I would first notice the verification.
    
    Then, obviously, the token ticker. I would prob naturally memorize that if I would be interested.
    
    Rev split is kindoff selv-evident, but it looks like the channel gets 80% of the rev and the token holders get the remaining 20%.
    
    And the patronage, I guess I would not know what it means right off the bat, so I would hover over the tooltip. 
    
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the revenue split information?
- Notes
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important is for you information about token verification?
- Notes

### Price widget

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    Looks like the token price is 150K. Not sure what the $2.5 below really is. And I do not know in which currency is this 150K.
    
    Sale type, I can see it’s an automated market maker. 
    
    And then total supply.
    
    I would not know what exactly is this total supply, is it outstanding, or is it what’s present right now, or whether that’s how much there can be in total.
    
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the price? (AMM state)

### Statistics

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    With the total transaction value I would like to know what date range it is, eg. is it last week, or month?
    
- [ ]  Please tell me more about those pills with percentages - what is that?
- Notes

### Holders

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    Clicks on the *Show more* button **instantly.
    
    Because of the Vested column I can see how much holders are allowed to sell.
    
- [x]  In the table there are percentages - do you know what they represent?
- Notes
    
    I think the percentage is out of the total supply.
    
- [x]  If you open this token page and there are 200 holders of that token how many of them should be presented here on the main page?
- Notes
    
    I think 10 is about good. I usually look at the top 10, and then the top 20 under that I only scan through just to understand who’s holding the significant amount of tokens. 
    
    So yeah, this is about right, because you can always click “Show more”. I would say between 8-10.
    

## States

- [x]  Now we will talk about states (present the states prototype)
- [x]  Each screen I would like you to take a pause and describe for me how you understand that particular state - what changed

### State 1

- Notes
    
    

### State 2

- Notes
    
    Looks like they’re selling 36K of TRs in this round and that it ends in 12 hours. 
    
    **It’s a public sale so it prob means it’s open to anybody.**
    
    *[When Kuba prompted Zach to read the tooltip for the Public sale]* I guess that opposed to AMM, “Public” makes sense. Another word that comes to my mind would be “Open”, or “Direct”? Not sure if “Direct” makes sense in this context.
    
- [ ]  Additional: Please rate for me the importance 1/10 of all informations in price widget now when we have new information presented - price/tokens/time/supply
- Notes

### State 3

- Notes
    
    I noticed that this one is verified and that it’s not on sale right now.
    
    Does it mean it’s available on the exchange? And if it’s not available on the exchange, is it available to buy?
    

### State 4

- Notes
    
    Looks like this one is AMM again, and that only whitelisted members… *Click on the requirements button* Looks like this is what you need to do in order to get on the whitelist. Looks good.
    
    I don’t think I’m on the whitelist.
    
    Oh, wait, no, I’m whitelisted, it says so right over here *[he points to the label next to the token ticker]*
    

### State 5

- Notes
    
    Looks like I am on the whitelist, so I’m good to go.
    

### State 6

- Notes
    
    Oh, it’s an active revenue split…
    
    So it’s like a staking period…
    
    If I would be on the spot, I wouldn’t probably know what it means.
    
    I can’t click on the Stake button, but my best guess on what would happen is I would be staking my tokens, however much I have.
    
    I guess I have 12 hours to stake my tokens and then I get my revenue.
    
- [ ]  How do you understand stake action - what will happen if you click this? Why is it displayed for you?
- Notes

## Purchase

- [ ]  Please buy the token and describe everything aloud
- Notes
    
    *Goes through the first step very quickly, not making any comments, then pauses on the next step. Reads through tooltips to get the idea of what vesting period is. Thinking he got it, he immediately accepts the terms and completes the flows.*
    
- [ ]  How was it for you to purchase the token that way?
- Notes

## Final

- [ ]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask  about?
- Notes
    
    I like the flow, I like how it’s all laid out.
