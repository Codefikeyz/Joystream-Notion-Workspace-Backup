# 1. Introduction

- [x]  Welcome & thank you part, what’s your name, etc.
- [x]  Briefly mention what is the subject of the study,
- [x]  Recording
- [x]  Confirm the answers to the questionarie
- **Notes**
    
     
    

# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. A/B

- [x]  Please dont click anything for now and focus on layout - which one of the two makes it easy for you to scan the page?

### Full

- Notes
    
    I think the B version is easier to understand for me. The A version is too distracting to me.
    

### Few

- Notes
    
    As long as the information on the left is about the token (the benefits), then I like the A version more. But if there are videos or other information about the channel, then I like version B more.
    

### Empty

- Notes
    
    Version B.
    

## 2. Describe

- [x]  What is the most important information that youre looking for when you open a token page?
- Notes
    
    *⚠️ I didn’t capture all the things he mentioned.*
    
    - Total locked (?) value,
    - What is the fee I’ll pay for the transaction,
- [x]  Please describe everything that you see and how you understand while browsing this page - you can click now
- Notes
    
    The general design of the page is good and clear. I like that I can see information about this token’s holders, and that I can see their portfolio. I like this very much.
    
    Statistics part is good, too. I like that there’s info on the channel’s revenue.
    
    I understand this part (left-hand side column) is a general information about the token and the channel, too. My understanding is that if the channel has some videos, 
    
    Is the first video some kind of the NFT, or is this information about the token? I would imagine that the creator of the channel can record a video to tell a story about themselves and the channel, or the token.
    
    Before I invest in something, I do my own investigation. I wouldn’t probably rely on this video too much. 
    

## 3. Page elements

- [ ]  Now we will take a closer look at some of the elements on the page

### Token header

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element?
- Notes
    
    In the first line there’s an info about this token being unverified. I don’t know what it means. Does Josytream verify tokens?
    
    Then, there’s a token name, a revenue split, and patronage. These names are infamiliar to me. I guess that the Rev Split means “how much tokens investors bought from you” (?). About the Patronage — I have no idea what it is, nothing comes to my mind. Maybe it’s a token share of his fees, or his investors… *He disregards tooltips.* I would probably have to Google it and then try to learn what patronage value is good.
    
    *[After being specifically instructed about the presence of tooltips]* I noticed the info icon above, in the “This token is not yet verified”, but in Rev Split and Patronage  I thought these icons were zeroes. 
    
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the revenue split information?
- Notes
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important is for you information about token verification?
- Notes

### Price widget

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    I was able to notice the info button next to the AMM information. I know that AMM usually means Automated Market Maker, so I’m assuming it’s the same thing here.
    
    Nothing is confusing for me here. The price, the buy/sell buttons. It’s all clear.
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the price? (AMM state)
- Notes
    
    I like both information on the page so I give them both 10/10.
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the total supply? (AMM state)
- Notes
    
    I like both information on the page so I give them both 10/10.
    

### Statistics

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    I can see that the total transaction value is down, so it means that people don’t move this token a lot now. 
    
    Channel revenue is how many tokens the channel holds, as I understand it.
    
    This is good information to me. How much the channel owns, how much people own. I like all information here.
    
- [x]  Please tell me more about those pills with percentages - what is that?
- Notes

### Holders

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    I can see both investors and the creator of the token. For example, I can see that the first holder person (Martin) holds much more tokens than the creator.
    
    No confusion here. 
    
- [x]  In the table there are percentages - do you know what they represent?
- Notes
    
    *Takes a while to think about it*
    
    It means how many tokens they hold, based on the total supply. It was instantly clear. I like this.
    
    I like the fact we have token holders information here, this way I can track them down and see if they buy and sell a lot.
    
- [x]  If you open this token page and there are 200 holders of that token how many of them should be presented here on the main page?
- Notes
    
    As long as we can see all holders after clicking on the “Show more” button, then I think presenting 10 people is enough here.
    

## States

- [ ]  Now we will talk about states (present the states prototype)
- [ ]  Each screen I would like you to take a pause and describe for me how you understand that particular state - what changed

### State 1

- Notes
    
    This is the AMM sale. It’s a very good feature, because it means that users don’t need any other platforms to move tokens around.
    
    *When asked if he can see how much does the creator gets out of each sale type, he tried looking for this information in the Public sale & AMM tooltips.*
    

### State 2

- Notes
    
    I like we have this kind of sale here. 
    
- [ ]  Additional: Please rate for me the importance 1/10 of all informations in price widget now when we have new information presented - price/tokens/time/supply
- Notes

### State 3

- Notes
    
    I don’t understand, if this is about the person who created this token, or is this because of the Joystream market?
    
    If I’m looking on a person’s page, it must be about a person. Perhaps one person can create an infinite number of creator tokens and they can sell them all here.
    

### State 4

- Notes
    
    It’s a very good feature! So a person who’s owning this channel can choose who gets to buy their token. 
    
    *[When asked if he thinks he’s on a whitelist based on this design, he opened up the whitelist requirements list]* If I understand correctly, I didn’t do neccessary tasks from the list, so I’,m not whitelisted.
    

### State 5

- Notes
    
    Yaaay! I’m whitelisted now! 
    

### State 6

- Notes
    
    When the creator makes some income, he can share it with token holders through this. 
    
    I would imagine, having clicked on the Stake button, that I will be asked about how many tokens do I want to stake, and then it will let me stake it. But I’m concerned that I can’t see how much it will cost, what’s the vesting schedule, etc.
    
- [x]  How do you understand stake action - what will happen if you click this? Why is it displayed for you?
- Notes

## Purchase

- [x]  Please buy the token and describe everything aloud
- Notes
    
    *Finds the Buy button quickly and clicks on it right away*
    
    Like a Metamask transaction, I can see everything here. I know how much will I pay.
    
    *Clicking on Continue*
    
    I can see my vesting schedule here. I understand that if I buy this token now, I’ll need to wait 7 months to get it? I don’t have extensive knowledge about vesting schedules and how it works, but my best guess, looking at this design, is that I can’t take anything from what I buy during the first month. And then after 1 month passes, I get my first payout, and then after 7 months I can get the rest.
    
    *Confirming the transaction and seeing the welcome screen*
    
    Oh, the welcome screen is a good feature. It’s a summary of what I did? Maybe we can give the channel creator more options to provide links, eg. including telegream, etc.
    
- [x]  How was it for you to purchase the token that way?
- Notes

## Final

- [x]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask  about?
- Notes
    
    It’s a good design. I liked it from the very beginning.
    

# 5. Wrap-up

- [x]  Thank the participant and request the wallet address
