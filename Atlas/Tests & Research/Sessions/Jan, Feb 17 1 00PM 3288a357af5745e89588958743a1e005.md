# 1. Introduction

- [x]  Welcome & thank you part, what’s your name, etc.
- [x]  How did you find out about this study,
- [x]  Briefly mention what is the subject of the study,
- [x]  Confirm the answers from the screener.
- Notes
    
    Never heard of Joystream
    
    I dont usually comment videos, I used to some time ago, but now I rarely look into videos comments
    
    I think that reddit gives me please of reading what other people thinks - youtube gives more youvenile feeling - in reddit you can find intyeresting infromation
    
    I would argue if commenting system on youtube is easier to use than on reddit - on reddit one time I wasn’t sure if Im commenting on the right thread and sometimes I wans’t sure if I comment the right thread so it can be challenging to use reddit
    
    I think that when Im browsing reddit vs quickly scrolling comments on youtube - one thing is different on reddit - the awards that distinguish the comments - I really enjoy them - reddit have a better comment nesting system than youtube which enables keeping conversation to the point
    
    On reddit you can be overwhelmed with the ammount of comments - it also differs based on how you consume the content - the platform you use 
    
    On reddit you go to see comments mainly - to understand different points of view
    
    Reddit can be more challenging for a new users but even more experienced reddit consumers it can be overwhelming to see the amounts of comments and different points of view - it makes consuming the content sometimes a challenge
    
    I try to get to the truth 
    
    expanding and collapsing comments is great on reddit - I can move on when I finnish the thread
    
    Liking and diskliking on youtube - no , upvote and donwote on reddit - its really rarely that I upvote the topic sometimes I upvote the comment but its also rare, but if it comes to youtube when they hid the dislikes since then every hint to0 like, subscribe from creator influences me more to do it - but we still like videos more than comments- very rare to like youtube comments
    

# 2. Intro to the app

<aside>
⚠️ Only for the participants who said they’re not familiar with the app OR they’re not familiar with web3 concepts

</aside>

- [x]  Joystream is a video platform controlled, owned and operated by its users,
- [x]  The video platform is based on blockchain & what does it mean,
- [x]  Show the Polkadot extension:
    - [x]  *To manage your blockchain account, you will need a Polkadot browser,*
    - [x]  *There’s no password to your Joystream membership, there’s a Polkadot extension.*
- [x]  Go through the flow of uploading a video and demonstrate how information are stored on the blockchain,
- [x]  Ask for questions.
- Notes
    
    Yes so my initial thought when you mentioned authenticating on the platform I was expecting you to use metamask
    

# 3. Tasks & questions

- [ ]  **Introduction:**
    - [x]  Share a link to a Figma prototype, explain the technical details,
    - [x]  Explain what is the subject of the study,
    - [x]  *Imagine yourself just joined the platform and found an interesting video you’d like to comment for the very first time. There are a couple of tasks we would like you to perform to see if the UI is intuitive and clear enough.*
    - [x]  Mention acting like we’re not here,
    - [x]  Mention thinking-aloud protocol,
    - [x]  Mention that it’s the prototype that’s being tested, not the test subject,
    - [x]  Mention that we’re not looking for flattering answers.
    - Notes
        
        
- [ ]  **Question 1: Sorting**
*1. How do you think comments are sorted right now?
2. Do you think you can change that?
3. How do you thank would affect the comments you added?*
    - Notes
        
        Alright 
        I assume that the comments are sorted with the most popular at the top
        
        And Im thinking that popularity are identified by the amount of reactions which are the engagement
        
        To change I would try to click here 
        
        I can change to newest comment and oldest
        
        I would expect my comment to show up on the top
        
- [ ]  **Task 1: Add a comment in the main thread**
*Can I ask you to simply add a new comment under the video? Say “I like this video a lot!”
Heads up: Because it’s a Figma prototype, comments are going to be prepopulated.*
    - Notes
        
        So I would I assume the top level thread
        I would insert a comment her
        Reads the tooltip information
        I enjoy that there is an information provided about the comments being stored on blockchain
        Has problems with repeating the same info inside tooltip
        Alright clikcs hmmm
        I have to confirm it, ok
        Its to technical for me to validate if polkadot extension is showing the right thing
        And when I sign it went through
        And yeah this is where I expected it to show up
        
        Its preety straight forward 
        
        Since its on blockchain its quite permanent - now i get some vibes from commenting system that are simmilar to twitter - you cannot edit your post - it makes me think ad be more carefull when I write a comment - dont write anything silly
        
        I would expect to be able to edit and delete my comments - it would require from me a different more serious approach for commenting if I wouldn’t have this option - it would stay on internet potentially forever - I would treat it more seriously for better or worse
        
- [ ]  **Task 2: Add a reply to a comment that already has some replies**
*Can I ask you to add a comment as a reply to the acuate_anton’s comment? Say “good points!”*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks reply
        I can see the reply icon
        I like that it confirms that Im replying to this person- I dont need to put @ and mention people nice
        Notices that he can save password for 15 minutes
        Nothing confusing
        Im thinking whether or not using when I press reply the moment when input field shows up - its a plus that I have a list of peeople who are in the thread - but maybe I would like to have a part of the comment in the placeholder
        I like it i think this is a good approach to give me a piece of mind especially when Im on blockchain
        
- [ ]  **Task 3: Add a reply to a reply**
*Can I ask you to add a reply to bittyarlen’s comment?*
    - Notes
        
        So i hover and press
        Now I have the at mention 
        He proceeds
        I sign the transaction
        Wait a second
        I expected it to show up higher in the hierarchy and creating a new sub level but here below all comments is good enaugh
        When I was confirming the transaction in polkadot - the polkadot extension doesn’t match the joystream branding - which gives me feeling that I might not be on joystream anymore
        I expected another level but when I replied hmmm - stops - I dont have anything to share
        
- [ ]  **Question 2: Commenting**
*Based on this prototype, how often would you imagine yourself commenting videos in Atlas, compared to how often you currently comment videos on YouTube or other social media platforms, in general? Less often, more often, or would it be about the same?*
    - Notes
        
        I think it would be more often because of the web3 reason and the persistance of information - now comments are more important
        I would even expect to be rewarded for commenting in the future if my comment is really popular
        Not necessarly money as a reward but something that as a consumer I can use in joystream
        If there was some sort of a place where I could see all of my comments and how they have impacted conversation it would be interesting
        I would expect more interactions when Im commenting - Im addressing real people - I would love to see some more information about other people who is taking part in conversation - I would like to see if we have something in common
        When I go to “user” profile - i would love to see their interest, comments, some enablers to be more social
        
- [ ]  **Task 4: Adding reactions**
*Can you see the comment from the member named abrupt_tammy (2nd from the top)? How do you think other people feel about this comment? Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction to it?*
    - [ ]  **Subtask 1: Undoing a reaction**
    *If you were to change your mind and wanted to undo this reaction, do you think you can do that? How would you do that?*
    - [ ]  **Subtask 2: Adding a new reaction**
    *Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction once again, but this time to the comment below, from the user called “morniniglikesbar”?*
    - Notes
        
        Immidietly click on heart
        Oh that unexpected about dialog
        OK so I already left a comment so I assume that I wouldnt get that after leaving a comment
        Cool - I did it
        To undoo I would click on it again
        Quickly sign transaction
        Everything happens just like I assume it will
        
        2 OK so I assume i can expand this
        I wonder why the reply appears on the hover the icon menu is always visible when reply appears only on hover
        Nothing necessarly unclear - there are not that many options to leave emotes I would assume to add some other emotes
        
- [ ]  **Question 3: Reactions**
*Imagine that YouTube introduces reactions to comments in the same way you just experienced it in the prototype. How would that affect how often you react to other people's comments: less often, or more often, or would it stay the same? Why?*
    - Notes
        
        If I were able to have acces to my unique set of acces that would have me more inclined to leave reactions - in a way to say that I was here - if there is so little this is non individualistic - for me web3 offers this unique ability to spread your uniqness 
        
        If only this I would be more inclined to use commenting system on youtube because this comments althought they carry more info than simple like unlike - this icons would enrich every comment
        
        When I see thumbs up I think its something positive, when crying face I assume there is something different that people think about it
        
- [ ]  **Question 4: Unlimited reactions**
*1. Which reactions system do you see yourself using more often, compared to each other?
2. How do you think people feel like about the first comment, based on two versions?
3. Which option makes it easier for you to quickly see how do people feel about different comments?*
    - Notes

### Unexpected questions scenario

In case the participant asks about a feature that was not included in the scope, the following questions should be used:

1. Is this something you would expect to be able to do?
2. Would the lack of this feature somehow affected your willingness to use the commenting system on Atlas?

# 4. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Open mic. Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience with comments on Atlas?
- [ ]  Ask for a Polkadot wallet address, or a Joystream member handle/ID.
- [ ]  Thank the participant for taking part in the study and ask if we can reach out in the future.
- Notes
    
    @Netguru Design Adam, we’d need a joystream  substrate generic wallet address starting with 5.. I think we need to update the copy to share the wallet you’re registered in Joystream with :) .. This one starts with 1 and I think it is for Polkadot chain
