    March 21, 2021 — she started using BitCloud[?].
    
    She stopped buyng and selling when she had to do her taxes.
    
    I haven’t been active buying and selling lately just for the taxes purposes.
    
    She fucking tries to be legit.
    
    There needs to be something, or a tracker (I use open prosper to track my transactions).
    

# 2. Task & Questions

### Buying

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience while buying tokens on DESO
- Notes
    
    Pretty frictionless. It’s pretty easie. All I need to do is make sure my wallet has DeSo in it.
    
    I’ve only sent in Bitcoin and used it to convert it to DeSo. 
    
    It’s nice that I can see how much DeSo is US dollars when I’m buying creator tokens.
    
- [x]  What are you looking for when investing in a new coin? How do you make sure its a good investment and that you want to invest in this particular one?
- Notes
    
    It’s all research. I’m still learning so many things and I;ve been burned….
    
    Overall, what makes me decide is almost always I need to like THE PERSON, or THE THING behind the coin. I don’t buy coins that have bullshit behind them. Ethics!
    
    Coins from people or creators that are valuable to the community, so that inevitebly their coin value is going to go up.
    
    I’m a good person and I hope that these people will succeed.
    
    The next things is what are they [creators] doing. And if it interests me. Like art, for example.
    
    I used to buy more speculative coins (Elon?) in the past.
    
    If the founder rewards is too high then I don’t buy it. The highest value I can accept is 50%.
    
    50% in my mind is “I’m doing this, and then there’s your half” and that we’re sort of a team. 
    
    I’m personally at 21% and I don’t see that as high.
    
    For a coin price — I don’t give a shit. Because I only buy a fraction of that.
    
- [x]  While buying, the tokens have some price do you know where this price come from? What do you think about it -does it make sense for you that this price is set this way? is it fair?
- Notes
    
    What I understand of it is that there’s a coin and then there are poeple who own the coin…
    
    I assume the AMM is….
    
    I traded 
    
    Everyone is agreeing on the price a
    
    I feel like it’s fair because everyone is paying for it? 
    
    *She doesn’t seem to question the price in AMM.*
    
    It’s more democratic maybe? But then people are stupid… I don’t know. I think it’s fair. I accept it.
    
    I don’t know how one could make it better.
    
- [x]  What will scare you away from buying the token - is there any particular thing that if you see that - you dont invest at all?
- Notes
    
    If I don’t agree with their personality or what they do or they life.
    
    One time I bought a creator token, and then I didn’t do an extensive research about them, and then they *checked out* [?]. 
    
    I need to mostly talk to them, if I haven’t been before.
    
    If the creator don’t have other social media or something else, then I’d be hesitant.
    
- [x]  As a buyer how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that token prices behave on DESO?
- Notes
    
    I’m a very optimistic person and I have a very positive attitude.
    
    I’d say I’m happy… Like 65% of the time.
    
- [x]  Have you ever invested in any project really early when the price is really low? Have you ever invested in a project late when the price is high? Do you feel any tension caused by the fact that if you don’t invest early enough it might be too late?
- Notes
    
    Yes, I’ve invested in a project when the price was very low. *She explained that she somehow bought a token for 0$, or something?*
    
    And then yeah, I’ve invested in a project which price was very high. *And then she mentioned the project’s name, but I didn’t get it.*
    
    And no, I don’t feel any tension at all. Bc ususally I invest in a person, or personally. It doesn’t matter what’s the price, because it will be higher if the person is doing good work then the price is going to go up inevitably.
    
    “Whatever the question was, I guess I’m okay with it.”
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience from any purchase?
- Notes
    
    Yup!
    
    It was a rackpool[?]. The best hacking is done through social engineering. You gotta go through some people. So yeah, I’ve learned my lesson. Oh god, oh god, oh god. I don’t wanna talk about that.
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of buying the coins?
- Notes
    
    I have my own coin. There’s a project that doesn’t display numbers and I think that’s good [? to be validated with a recording!!!].
    
    *Cashtags.* It cures the searchability and you can make money out of it. I need to tell you about it some other time.
    
- [x]  From the buyer perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes
    
    I used to treat DeSo it like casino, and then…
    

### Selling

- [x]  What is your token name?
- Notes
    
    I have many. The main name is **Katramdeen**, then there’s **Metazoafilms**.
    
    I’m an actor. I run my own production company. 
    
    And then I have this: **WomankindCrypto**. There’s also a website for this that I built myself. And this is because all of crypto is mostly men. So much men. I want women to have money. Because if you have money then you have freedom. I’m going to use the money from it on advertising. And this token is also on DeSo.
    
- [x]  Tell me more about your experience of selling your own token?
- Notes
    
    All my faith and trust is in the AMM.
    
    People buy in at the price when it was low and I felt really good at it. I liked that they could buy a lot of coins at once, because the price was low. And it’s really nice to see that. You can treat those people differently, bc they’re my early investors.
    
- [x]  When selling, the tokens have some price set by the platform - what do you think about this price - does it make sense for you?
- Notes
    
    100% totally fine. Buying and selling is the same thing for me. 
    
- [x]  As a seller how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that platform sets price for your token?
- Notes
    
    Maybe even 77%? Something high up there. When it comes to me I know my worth. I know I’m the best. 
    
    Sometimes DeSo would display that someone sold their token. I don’t give a shit if someone sells. That’s them. People are not me.
    
- [x]  As a seller you cannot customize anything if it comes to the sale of you coin does that bother you?
- Notes
    
    To be able to set my own price? Wowwww. That’d be really cool. Like a company that sells their shares? 
    
    But I like the convenience of the AMM. I don’t have to think about it, it’s all automated.
    
    But maybe in the future, when I’m a bigger creator and I have a well established company, I might want to control the price more. But then I guess I might not know enough about it and the stock market.
    
    Right now, I’m good with AMM. But I see benefits of having it customised.
    
    Also, I’d see benefits of doing a hybrid. Maybe even the best.
    
- [x]  How happy you are on 1-10 scale with the way the sale is handled for you?
- Notes
    
    It’s pretty good. I don’t know, like a 9? 
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience while selling your coin?
- Notes
    
    No. Zero. Only good memories. *Laughs.*
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of selling the coins?
- Notes
    
    No, I can’t think of anything.
    
- [x]  From the seller perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes
    
    We got to put buys/sells to the side. 
    
    I’d like to see under the good where can I go to see all of this. Becuase on the exchange I can see the order book and other things. And no, the blockchain is not the solution. It’s so complicated, it’s the worst. I want to look at the AMM. I need to see it.  I want to see it. I need to visualise it.
    
    Limit orders! I’d love to have limit orders. Both for buying and selling! That would be so good!
    
    Diamond is soooooo bad.
