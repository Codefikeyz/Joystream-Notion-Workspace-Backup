# 2. Task & Questions

### Buying

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience while buying tokens on DESO
- Notes
    
    I live in India. Waiting for my job to start. I’m between leaving the college and starting a new job.
    
    I made a lot of money on DeSo/web3. Mostly buying creator tokens early, and selling them when they became more popular.
    
- [x]  What are you looking for when investing in a new coin? How do you make sure its a good investment and that you want to invest in this particular one?
- Notes
    
    If the account is very new and there’s no very genuine person behind the account the higher the chance it’s a scam.
    
    If a famous person is buying someone else’s tokens then the higher chances that this account is legitimate.
    
    I’m also looking for uneven distribution, because I know I need to be careful about that. If the person who holds the majority of creator token decides to sell, then the price drop is significant.
    
    I, for example, hold the most of my coin. It’s all about the creator’s reputation. 
    
    If the creator is very new and don’t have a strong reputation, then 2-3 coins is a reasonable amount for this creator to hold of their own token. 
    
    There’s been a lot of debate over the bounding curve in our community. People complain it’s not good for the long-term. For example, after the price reaches a certain level, no one wants to invest in it anymore, because the graph becomes stagnant.
    
- [x]  While buying, the tokens have some price do you know where this price come from? What do you think about it -does it make sense for you that this price is set this way? is it fair?
- Notes
    
    
- [x]  What will scare you away from buying the token - is there any particular thing that if you see that - you dont invest at all?
- Notes
    
    *He mentioned something about scams, but I couldn’t really understand what he was saying. Something about getting public keys and getting a list of transactions for that public key. He mentioned tools such as ProperCloud and that not a lot of people are aware of the fact that such tools exist.*
    
- [x]  As a buyer how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that token prices behave on DESO?
- Notes
    
    Even creators sometimes get tempted to earn quick and easy money, which rarely works. *Then he brought up an example of a friend of him who got scammed.*
    
    I’d rate 7?
    
    Don’t be too much greedy. Just think logically, just use math. If you’ve done your math right there’s no chance you’re going to lose. Some people are so proficient with using math in the context of creator tokens, that they are able to earn profits even from scammers.
    
    From my personal perspective, it’s best if the creator owner don’t hold any of their tokens.
    
    But from the perspective of the entire DeSo community, it’s considered very bad.
    
- [x]  Have you ever invested in any project really early when the price is really low? Have you ever invested in a project late when the price is high? Do you feel any tension caused by the fact that if you don’t invest early enough it might be too late?
- Notes
    
    *Did not understand anything he said about this.*
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience from any purchase?
- Notes
    
    I wasn’t aware you have to buy your own coins initially. So my 20 coins got minted from my own account but I wasn’t an owner of them. [?] People were making money off my account, but I didn’t get any of that. So I raised the founder’s reward to 100% so that everyone sold their coins and then I bought them back.
    
    10% of FR is very common and is considered to be a golden ration. It is expected from you, as a creator token owner, to be lowering your FR as the price is getting higher.
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of buying the coins?
- Notes
    
    They could implement a locking mechanism. So that, as an woner, I can’t sell my coin until it reaches certain point. This way buyers can feel safer. This is a very debatable topic in the community right now. Community and investors want it, but creators are not pushing for this because they want freedom to sell their coins at any time they want. In my personal opinion, in the long term the locking mechanism is going to make things easier for investors and therefore for token creators, too.
    
    *And then he mentioned another thing but I didn’t get any of that. Something was steep, that’s all I got.*

### Selling

- [x]  What is your token name?

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience of selling your own token?
- Notes
    
    I consider the current situation to be a win-win for both creators and investors.
    
- [x]  When selling, the tokens have some price set by the platform - what do you think about this price - does it make sense for you?
- Notes
    
    Some creators feel they do not want to sell their coins to traders who are just looking for another opportunity to invest their money in. 
    
    The number of creators who are interested in limiting who can buy their coin is very small. Who doesn’t want to earn money?
    
- [x]  As a seller how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that platform sets price for your token?
- Notes
    
    Selling your own coins is like destroying your reputation.
    
    You also want to be careful about who you’re giving your coins to. If you give it to a trader, this person is going to sell it immediately, which is rather something you don’t want.
    
- [x]  As a seller you cannot customize anything if it comes to the sale of you coin does that bother you?
- Notes
    
    Sometimes it bothers me that I can’t customise it. But I’ve never been much of a creator, I’m more of a trader. 
    
- [x]  How happy you are on 1-10 scale with the way the sale is handled for you?
- Notes
    
    From my perspective, it’s very smooth, it’s very automatic, you don’t have to do anything.
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience while selling your coin?
- Notes
    
    Sometimes if there’s an NFT, and I’m selling then, they place a bid and then they cancel it after 5 minutes. Before you get a notification, the bid is already cancelled, so it’s very disappointing. I don’t know why people do that. 
    
    People would invest in a coin and sell it after 10 seconds. I recall someone investing $3K in my project only to sell it all a day after. That was disappointing. There’s no locking for an investment, which allows for price manipulation.
    
    What people would sometimes do to prevent the above is giving someone 50% of their *[? revenue, investment]*, and then another 50% after some time. 
    
    As an investor, I’d personally love it to have the locking mechanism, because that also makes me safe about my investment.
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of selling the coins?
- Notes
    
    The UI is good. What DeSo is lacking is that they don’t have many daily active REAL users. What DeSo users want is more users. Other than this, everything’s there. The UI/UX experience is also good.
    
    Most posts are about money or rewards, so it would be good to have some filter about what type of content you want to see on DeSo.
