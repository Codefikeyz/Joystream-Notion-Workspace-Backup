# 2. Task & Questions

### Buying

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience while buying tokens on DESO
- Notes
    
    Last May, it took me a minute to figure it out. I didn’t read any docs, juust started using the platform. I quicklt realised there’s a bonding curve. I experimented with buying and selling my own coins. I don’t have a strong background in the math, but I know enough to use it. I lost a few bucks at the beginning. I’m buying my own coins to show people that I’m commited to the paltform. 
    
    When I make a big sale, I’d throw that money into my coins to reward my community.
    
    I’m in the minority that loves the bonding curve. It’s perfect. It incentives long-term holding if the conditions are right.
    
     I don’t personally have any bots. I like to do everything manually. It’s more fun this way. 
    
    I watch FRchange channel (on some Discord server) and if there’s anything interesting, and I’d buy as early as possible: coins that have potential, people that have potential.
    
    Wrecking yourself on that bounding curve is a very easy thing to do. So I’d oftentimes give some newcomers $10 or so to make their experience better from the start.
    
    Once I’d throw $100 carelessly into a coin and I got lucky because someone else bought it afterwards.
    
    It’s all about timing and watching the feeds, if that’s your thing. It’s part of my hobby.
    
    I like the platform, the social aspect, but I also like trading and the psychological apsecr of it.
    
    Once it gets busy it gets ruthless. Like “who’s going to get scammed today”? But sometimes in a friendly way, there are mostly friends playing with each other and throwing money around.
    
    I don’t like people who want to fork the chain and change it into stablecoin or get rid of the bounding curve. I can see there’s a need for it, but for me it’s just boring.
    
- [x]  What are you looking for when investing in a new coin? How do you make sure its a good investment and that you want to invest in this particular one?
- Notes
    
    This is everyone’s problem. It’s a tough one.
    
    There are different tiers of users. 
    
    There’s a normal type of user, off-the-street. And there might not be a huge potential to become famous, so maybe I’d invest a little bit to get the community going.
    
    And then there’s creator, small artists which I like to support. I like finding new music, new emerging artists and support them. 
    
    Whether to invest or not, I also look at the FR. Most people are pretty low on their FR. **I have mine [FR] set high (23%?) to disincentive people who are not committed.**
    
    Once the bounding curve gets high enough, unless you’re playing with big chunks and there’s super high trading on it, it’s tough to justify an investment. It really depends on the market condition. 
    
    There’s a lot of factors. There’s also the psychological aspect: what are other people going to think of this person, what are other people going to think of this project, etc.
    
- [x]  While buying, the tokens have some price do you know where this price come from? What do you think about it -does it make sense for you that this price is set this way? is it fair?
- Notes
    
    To me, the DeSo bounding curve makes perfect sense and I love it. Because I’ve been studying [didn’t mention what exactly]. It’s also unforgiving if you don’t understand it. It’s easy to get wrecked and lose money.
    
    It’s steep enough to teach people lessons.
    
    I like playing poker. Back when it was legal in the US, pokerstarts were legal in the US. And I thought I knew how to play it, and then I started playing with people who really knew how to play poker. And that was fine. I was paying for poker lessons, basically.
    
    I think it’s set up perfectly, yeah. There’s a lot of thought. They studied these things and they put it on purpose.
    
- [x]  What will scare you away from buying the token - is there any particular thing that if you see that - you dont invest at all?
- Notes
    
    #1 reason is the cap table (screenshot). It’s the first thing I look at.
    
    Even if the coin was very interesting, but there were people on the cap table which I didn’t like, I’d be hesitant to invest. Usually I’d get out, wait for them to leave and then I’d get in.
    
    ![Untitled](Zach,%20May%2025,%2016%2000/Untitled.png)
    
    It’s about knowing the community, knowing the people. I’ve spent thousands of hours on the platform to track everyone down, but it’s my hobby.
    
- [x]  As a buyer how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that token prices behave on DESO?
- Notes
    
    It’s perfect. It’s responsive. I was thinking about it yesterday, like: how much math and how much is there behind the scenes.
    
    It’s really responsive to real-time changes, yeah. It’s perfect.
    
- [x]  Have you ever invested in any project really early when the price is really low? Have you ever invested in a project late when the price is high? Do you feel any tension caused by the fact that if you don’t invest early enough it might be too late?
- Notes
    
    Of course, yes. Very much so. Especially with coins that are important or have potential.
    
    Sometime people would drop interesting stuff late at night, so I keep myself up.
    
    It can mean a difference between $20 and $20 000. It’s about paying attention.
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience from any purchase?
- Notes
    
    I’ve lost thousands of dollars on rack pools. That’s part of learning. It’s about learning not to invest in sketchy coins.
    
    There’s a coin called CFR.  And then there’s account called Chicken Fried Rise. And this account made a post about CFR. So people started investing, people became crazy about it.
    
    Well, it was in the evening. I had to go out with my gf and I stayed at her place overnight. I left my money in there, and the next morning I found out I’ve lost $250. My mistake was leaving my money sitting in a very vulnerable position overnight.
    
    The app itself has been flawless. No “splippage” (?), not anything.
    
    Once there was a bug that caused certain coins to be lost, and I have a friend who figure it out and reported it. And they fixed it quickly. 
    
    But other than this, it’s been flawless.
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of buying the coins?
- Notes
    
    Optimise front-end UI so that we can buy and sell faster.
    
    It’s blockchain, so taking this under consideration I think it is pretty responsive.
    
- [ ]  From the buyer perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes

### Selling

- [x]  What is your token name?
- Notes
    
    **Znmead**
    
- [x]  Tell me more about your experience of selling your own token?
- Notes
    
    It’s been very passive. Never saw investments in my coin. (?) Never asked anyone to invest. I had it open and people would invest. It’s that simple. I don’t do anything else.
    
- [x]  When selling, the tokens have some price set by the platform - what do you think about this price - does it make sense for you?
- Notes
    
    Yes, because I understand it. I understand my coins’ personal journey, *if that’s a thing.*
    
    I paid my dues and I know how I’d have done it in the past, but know I think it’s totally fair.
    
    My investors know that even if I sell all my coins right now, that I’ll put it back eventually.
    
- [x]  As a seller how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that platform sets price for your token?
- Notes
    
    10! I love how it works. *Laughs* 
    
    I know how much the increase is going to be and… I don’t see people selling my coins very often. Usually people invest long-term in my coins.
    
    It’s very predictable from my perspective.
    
- [x]  As a seller you cannot customize anything if it comes to the sale of you coin does that bother you?
- Notes
    
    These are dillemas. These are part of the strategic actions you need to think about.
    
    Back in the days when the creator coins were very active there were people who I did not want on my coins. “Traders that don’t care, that are unpredictable”.
    
    There were a couple of occasions when I wish I had an opporunity to blacklist certain individuals.
    
    But even today, you can use FR to achieve a similar goal. You set it to 100% and let someone buy your coin and then you sell it to them(?) *[!] I didn’t get this part very well*
    
- [x]  How happy you are on 1-10 scale with the way the sale is handled for you?
- Notes
    
    If *something* was native to the platform, that’d be better.
    
    I’d better give my lack of trust to the platform, rather than people.
    
    This platform teaches you to trust people.
    
    Smart contracts are not very smart, because most people can’t really understand what’s inside.
    
    Smart services built by smart people are going to be a big thing in the future.
    
    If we look at the history I guess we can say most people have been wracked by smart contracts more than by other people.
    
    *Nat(?)* is a genius in my opinion.
    
    ---
    
    *After clarifying the question by Kuba:*
    
    Yeah, def a 10. Same as buys. Sales are flawless. 
    
    I like that people don’t have to ask me to sell.
    
    I think options to have these things would be great (like vesting periods), but I like the way it is automatically handled already.
    
    *On vesting periods/”lockups”: I* think the capability should be optional. I know it’s needed but I’m not sure if it’s feasible for this chain. Personally, I’d not use it. But the availability for the people who do want it would be really cool in addressing their concerns and other things. Maybe it would help build a bit more trust? Maybe. 
    
    IDEA: POKAZUJMY WIĘCEJ INFORMACJI O LUDZIACH, KTÓRZY KUPILI COINA, BEZPOŚREDNIO NA STRONIE Z COINEM.
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience while selling your coin?
- Notes
    
    Yeah, of course. People who I didn’t want on my cap table. I had to make a plan on how to get them out, things like dropping the price a little bit or other things.
    
    **Usually, though, when someone buys your coin it’s a good thing. But sometimes there are people who you just don’t want.**
    
    IDEA: SMART WHITELISTA, na podstawie statystyk memberów?
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of selling the coins?
- Notes
    
    Discovery part could be done better by giving a shoutout to interesting creators.
    
    Discovery is def a problem.
    
- [x]  From the seller perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes
    
    Bounding curve is a truly genius invention. It has demonstrated interesting ways in shaping the market.
