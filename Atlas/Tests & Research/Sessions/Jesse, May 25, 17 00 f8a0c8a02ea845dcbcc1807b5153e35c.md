# 2. Task & Questions

### Buying

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience while buying tokens on DESO
- Notes
    
    I started a brand in the network called DeSo.
    
    I joined them because I got interested in crypro and blockchain.
    
    I have a backgorund in music, I’ve been a musicion for the pasy 20 years.
    
    I started a brand in the web3 world that focuses on music, music theory, etc. I’m also hoping to build mobile apps and tools that would help people play with music.
    
    I joined DeSo because I wanted to get familiar with creator coins and other things.
    
    I had very little experience with DeFi and things along those lines.
    
    My initial experience with DeSo was that I bought little bits of lots of people coins just to see where will it go from there.
    
    I started understanding that things like AMM or bonding curve were tied a lot to prices of coins on DeSo.
    
    Instead of buying coins that were hot, I was looking to put a value in projects which creators were willing to build long-term.
    
    So yeah, my coin buying strategy has shifted a lot. 
    
- [x]  What are you looking for when investing in a new coin? How do you make sure its a good investment and that you want to invest in this particular one?
- Notes
    
    The coins I;ve been investing in lately, I’d first look how long a person would be on DeSo and what was my relation with this person.
    
    I was looking at things such as whether they are welcoming to new users, how they build social interactions, whether they have roadmaps for theirselves, etc.
    
    I’m really trying to get to know the project. I’d oftentimes join Discord servers for coins if available.
    
    **That’s what I like on DeSo is that you can get to know the people behind the coins.** 
    
- [x]  While buying, the tokens have some price do you know where this price come from? What do you think about it -does it make sense for you that this price is set this way? is it fair?
- Notes
    
    I guess it’s fair. 
    
    It feels the whole platform feel a bit more centralised, than I’d like. I get this feeling that we’re doing okay as long as the DeSo is doing okay, so we’re kind of dependent. 
    
    But in the long-run I’d love to see more independence from that.
    
- [x]  What will scare you away from buying the token - is there any particular thing that if you see that - you dont invest at all?
- Notes
    
    Believing in the project and hoping that people will stick to their roadmaps.
    
    I get kind of scared thinking of the idea that people might be distracted (for various reasons) from committing to their projects and fulfilling the promises.
    
    Not knowing who’s truly here for the long-term and who’s not.
    
    Sometimes I don’t quite see what the value is of a particular coin vs DeSo. Why wouldn’t I put the same money in DeSo? Nowadays I think that DeSo itself might have more value than creator tokens themselves.
    
- [x]  As a buyer how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that token prices behave on DESO?
- Notes
    
    I’d say 8 or so. I really like the process and… now I think that this dependence on DeSo helps me feel secure, in a way.
    
    I like the “easiness of having one bounding curve”.
    
- [x]  Have you ever invested in any project really early when the price is really low? Have you ever invested in a project late when the price is high? Do you feel any tension caused by the fact that if you don’t invest early enough it might be too late?
- Notes
    
    Definitely. 
    
    You experience this [FOMO] in DeFi and you experience this with social tokens. But with social tokens it might be even more severe because of how easy it is to buy and sell coins. 
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience from any purchase?
- Notes
    
    There’s def been some rack pools, yeah.
    
    I definitely had some other disappointing experiences.
    
    I can’t say I’ve experienced any disappointment in the actual process of buying. I experienced the thrill of getting some coins early (like I’m supporting this person).
    
    Sometimes it can be disappointing to see what some person’s price is compared to the DeSo price. Because I know that some people have been affected by this recent crypto crash more than the others. It’s disappointing to see people whose price were high before the crash, and now their price is pretty low. But then again it might be a benefit, because now these people are more affordable. 
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of buying the coins?
- Notes
    
    There’s not a lot of incentive to buy the coins, actually.
    
    I’ve seen some people doing some creative things, like every coin buyer ends up getting *[something].*
    
    But DeSo itself incentivising buying coins? I don’t see that happening a lot. In fact, I haven’t bought normal person’s creator coins in a while because of that, I’ve been more interested in buying coins for projects.
    
    I wish DeSo would make it easier to somehow award my coin holders, to incentive them. To make it more automated, rather than, for example, having to send these folks NFTs manually, or do other stuff.

### Selling

- [x]  What is your token name?
- Notes
    
    Harmonicity
    
- [x]  Tell me more about your experience of selling your own token?
- Notes
    
    I had lots of people  buying my coins and holding it for long-term. They were sort of DeSo OG’s. People who wanted to do it right.
    
    But lately I’ve noticed people who are buying my coins are short-term holders.
    
    I’m guessing their main motivation is holding my coin short-term as an experiment, just to learn. And I see it happening with my coin a lot recently
    
    Once in a while I’d post a music or some other work and I can notice coin buys from that, sort of a coin pump. These folks are thinking that they’re buying early, but it’s not really true.
    
    **I wish I could ask them sometime about their motives.**
    
    IDEA: ZRÓBMY TO. 👆
    
- [x]  When selling, the tokens have some price set by the platform - what do you think about this price - does it make sense for you?
- Notes
    
    At the beginning, Lots of people advised me to buy my own coins at the beginning to get the ball rolling. I’d buy something like 10 coins or so.
    
    I thought it’s more of a status thing, because I saw people with larger coin prices somehow  getting more attention under their posts. So that also motivated me to buy my own coins, but I don’t think that’s true anymore. 
    
    What’s disappointing is that it feels like my price is trading lower than the DeSo price at the moment. 
    
    I’ve been confused about the fact that I had to buy a lot of my coins to see the price go up. That has felt a little self-defeating. I was like “maybe I’d put a few backs in my coin every now and then to see the profit after a while”, but I didn’t see that being very profitable. Maybe there’s no point in buying my own coin at all? 
    
    It can be a little intimidating to buy your own coin, because you need to a buy a lot to see your price go up.
    
- [x]  As a seller how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that platform sets price for your token?
- Notes
    
    6.
    
    Overall I’m happy with this.
    
- [x]  As a seller you cannot customize anything if it comes to the sale of you coin does that bother you?
- Notes
    
    **No. Because I feel like it’s easier to get started when you have fewer options to play with.**
    
    Of course I’d do this if they had those options, but for now **I just enjoy the ease to be able to set it and forget it.**
    
    I’m okay with the platform having run that for me.
    
    Otherwise it would open up the can of worms of “do your own research”.
    
- [x]  How happy you are on 1-10 scale with the way the sale is handled for you?
- Notes
    
    Initially I was a little confused on how to sell creator coins and, I felt like… but I feel like it was more of a UI thing…
    
    ---
    
    *After clarifying:*
    
    9? That process has been very smooth.I haven’t noticed anything I would be unsure about.
    
    I think DeSo has done a great job on that: this sort of automated buying.
    
    It felt so easy for me, as the user, even though I haven’t done any research on that before.
    
    The problems you have on DeFi are way more personal on DeSo, because it’s social, and there are real names and faces tied to the sells of your coin.
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience while selling your coin?
- Notes
    
    Not that I’m aware of?
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of selling the coins?
- Notes
    
    There’s not a lot of what we can do to get people excited about our content, except for the content we post on DeSo.
    
    I’d like to implement mechanisms that would get people more excited about buying my coin.
    
    I’d love to see some kind of a modal that automatically sends them something about myself, or some automated thank you, or just something that gets them excited about buying my coin… The creator buying process should be more exciting and now I don’t have any control on that.
    
    When you sell NFT you can put unlockable content, which makes it more exciting. With creator coins though there’s nothing (except for the sole investing part) that makes it exciting.
