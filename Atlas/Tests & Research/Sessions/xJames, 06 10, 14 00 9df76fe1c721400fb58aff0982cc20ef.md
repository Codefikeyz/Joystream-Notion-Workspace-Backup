# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. Creating token

- [x]  Please create your own channel token & as you go describe for me how you understand all concepts that will be presented to you on each screen
- Notes
    - **I tried this interface the last time, so be aware that I might be more experienced than an average user.**
    - I’m confused by the text on the button, because it says “Create your token”, but the headline says “channel token”. To me, “channel token” and “my token” are not the same things.
    - My guess so far is that I’m about to create something similar to what I can create on BitClout.
    - When I click the “create” button, my expectations is that I’ll get a chance to first learn more about what creator tokens are, how they work exactly and how the process of creating a token looks like exactly.
    - **Step 1:**
        - (After clicking the “create” button) I can see a pretty scary interface, I’m having a hard time deciding on what should I focus on… I should probably start by filling out the information in the form?
        - (Looking at the permission type field) I have an analogy with public vs private companies and their shares.
        - (Looking at the revenue split field) 20% of all the revenue during specific period of time, but I’m not sure what the period of time is, will go to the token holders (and I believe it will be proportionally distributed across holders, depending on how much token they have).
        - (Looking at the patronage field) I don’t know what this *petronejż* is. I’m not sure I fully understand it. I’m not sure where these funds come from. I have no idea. I can understand that the higher the % the more the owner of the channel gets. I would need some more explanation on this. Some tooltip on how is this calculated, for example.
        - (Looking at the preview side of the form) On the left side I can see some sort of result I’ll get based on what I specify in the form. Yeah, this is the same as on the right-hand side.
        - (Looking at the transaction fee tooltip in the bottom left corner) This is pretty straightforward.
    - **Step 2:**
        - The introduction explanation is really good.
        - The form looks familiar.
        - I can only guess that the tokens that are *cliffed* can only be used for the revenue split (?)
        - Yeah, everything is quite clear, it is pretty good.
        - I’m not really sure about “2 years” of vesting period. It doesn’t tell me if the tokens will be released gradually, every block, or will this all become available to me only after 2 years… Based on the graph it seems to me that tokens will be released only a few times during these 2 years, specifically when the dots are placed.
        - Based on the description I suspect these settings apply for my buyers. I’m not sure if this is important to me at the moment.
    - **Step 3:**
        - Ok, this is a summary so I don’t need to fill out anything here; I just need to review which parameters I’ve specified.
        - BUt it seems there’s some new informaton in these tooltips? (Starts reviewing all the tooltips one by one).
        - (Looking at the “You will receive” tooltip) Well, this is pretty confusing description. It says tokens will be available to me, but I think it was supposed to say “to public”, “to users”.
    - (Created the token, looking at the confirmation dialog) Okay… What should I do? Click “OK”, or click “Open token page”? I don’t know what would I click at this point. Perhaps I would open up the token page in a new tab, and click “OK” in this tab, just to make sure I don’t miss anything important.
    

## 2. Token dashboard

- Notes
    - Well, it looks like a token page…
    - (Keeps scrolling up & down for a longer while).
- [x]  What would be the next action that you would take right now?
- Notes
    - Ok, on the top of the page I can see next steps that are proposed to me, which I believe increase my chances for a good token sale, I believe…
    - Below I can see some information about the token…
    - Then, there’s a list of token holders, seems like I’m the only one for now.
    - Then, there’s a revenue split. **But yeah, I still have no idea how it works.**
    - And then, the rest is nothing special.
    - I can see I can trigger a sale from 3 places on the page. So it seems like this page is encouraging me to start a token sale.
    - If I was here all by myself, I guess I would try to learn more about this “Token Master”, as it seems it’s very important. And then I would try the step #2, which is writing the token description. I guess I would follow the flow in the next steps.
- [x]  Please analyze the whole page and describe to me how you understand the concepts presented on it
- Notes
    
    *Notes above*
    

## 3. Edit the token page

- [x]  Edit your token page. Add a video trailer, one benefit, description and publish it.
- Notes
    - Video trailer is something like a marketing video for my token, telling everyone why the should buy my token.
    - (Clicks on “select video trailer” button and selects a video easily).
    - Ok, then there are benefits… I can see I can add a benefit. (Adds a benefit easily, but then confuses the description of the benefit with a description of the entire token).
    - (Then notices the “About” section and adds a description).
    - Ok, I think I can publish it. I believe I did everything I should have done.
    - (Clicks “Publish” button and then tries to click on the “Go to token page” in the toast notification).
    - Ok, I think I should go on to the next step… Oh, wait, no, I’m already on the next step.
    - **I think it’s safe to click on the “Start sale” button in the “Your progress” section.**
        - At first I wanted to click on the blue “Start sale” button, because it’s so prominent, but then I thought that clicking on the “Start sale” button in the “Your progress” section is a tiny bit safer. But I believe they’re the same buttons.

## 4. Sales

- [x]  Please tell me what the differences between public sale and AMM and how you understand it
- Notes
    - At first I thought I had some extra ??
    - It was my guess before I read the table that AMM would help me get liquidity on my token. THat the system would make a pool that would incentivise people to put their token in this pool, and that this way it would help me (???) to get a lot of liquidity. But then I read the table and it seems that there’re just 2 different types of sale.
        - The first one is that there’s a fixed amount of tokens that people can buy at a fixed price. And that they can be sold in a token sell event.
        - And then, the second options, is something like users can buy tokens on demand, and I think that’s pretty clear.
        - **But yeah, I haven’t read the table carefully at this point yet.**
    - (Proceeds with reading the table)
    - Wait, I don’t earn the money from the AMM sale? Then how does it work? Who earns the money from that sale? (Laughs) Well, I have no idea who gets the revenue.
    - (Trying to understand why the “Select creator sale” button is disabled) It seems that tokens are under vesting period… It seems that the cliff and vesting period I specified before is applicable to me, which is weird. I don’t understand… (???).

### AMM

- [x]  Sell your token on AMM and describe to me every concept that is presented to you and how you understand it
- Notes
    - **Step 1:**
        - Ok, so this is some interesting mechanics that changes the token price based on the demand. So, for example, if there’s a big demand the price goes.
        - Then there’s some legal stuff that I have to sign… I’m not really sure…
        - Oh, ok, so this is some default terms & conditions that I can change If i want. Very interesting. Should buyers of my token have QAC? That’s a very interesting question.
        - It is still not clear to me what will be the price change, because I have no idea how what’s the model here.
        - (Notices a “Learn more” link button) Oh, ok, there’s a help guide here. I guess I can try it to find some more information.
        - This is very strange that the numbers “1” and “2” are so far from each other in the price field.
    - **Step 2:**
        - Oh no! Now there’s a cliff & vesting for the buyers. So it means that previously when I was setting the cliff and vesting it was for me… Oh no, a little bit too much for me.
        - Ok, this is the same as before.
    - **Step 3:**
        - Alright, here’s the summary again.
        - (Looking at the page silently for a while) Emm… Okay.
        - **(Having started the sale he goes instantly: ) Ok, I should probably start a revenue split?**
        - (Asked if there’s a place where he can *inspect* his sale) Well, i can see this thing (he points to the Sale widget on the dashboard). **Wow, this “Sold to AMM” is strange: why on the sale you need to sell tokens? It is a sale, it is me who’s selling tokens, right?**
        - (He goes to the Sale tab by clicking on a link in the Sale widget) Ok, no much new info here…
        - (Having clicked on an empty state on the “ongoing sale” table) Ok, so somebody purchased my token. Ok, the exchange rate is pretty strange, as the table is showing a different data…
        - 

## Final

- [x]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask about?
- Notes

# 5. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Thank the participant and request the wallet address

Does not understand fully patronage

tip which will let understand the patronage maybe some calculations

12:50 - keeps repeating total circulation supply - does not understand that he will receive the tokens, mistakenly identifies the cliff and vesting & first payout

13:50 - wrong explanation

No information about when the tokens will be released causes user to think that those will be released every three months suggested by dots on graph which need to be removed

16:40 - mistakes the whole thing as it applies to the buyers

19:06 - confusing tooltip - still thinks that those tokens will be available for public

22:05 - looks like token page (need to tell more prominently that it is a dashboard not a token page)

The next step would be to learn about rank

And after that go for step num 2 to edit token page - and would follow the progress steps

33:08 - thought its an extra service not a sale type, compares this to uniswap AMM pool

35:50 - who earn money from my sale?

37:45 - now he realizes that its also applicable to me - he is confused - he would like to know about it that he wont be able to sell it on creator sale on the page where you add cliff and vesting 

44:20 - realizes that there is a cliff and vesting for buyers a little bit too much but maybe its okay that we have so much configuration

47:50 - confused why someone would sale to the AMM : “it should be me who sale my tokens”
