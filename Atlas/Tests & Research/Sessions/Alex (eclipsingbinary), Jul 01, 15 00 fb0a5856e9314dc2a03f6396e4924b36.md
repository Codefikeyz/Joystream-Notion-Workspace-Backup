# 1. Introduction

- [x]  Welcome & thank you part, what’s your name, etc.
- [x]  Briefly mention what is the subject of the study,
- [x]  Recording
- [x]  Confirm the answers to the questionarie
- **Notes**
    
     MintMe(?) is very new, there are not a lot of poeple there. I have my token for a year now. There’s a V1→V2 migration right now. If you hold a certain amount of tokens you can view posts of a creator. You can lock a post for a certain amount of tokens. 
    
    It’s a learning curve, I was invited by a friend who’s into Joystream.
    
    I’m a video creator so I’ve been waiting for a video DAO. So once I heard you guys are interested in creator tokens, I knew I had to go in. So now I’m just patiently waiting.
    

# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. A/B

- [x]  Please dont click anything for now and focus on layout - which one of the two makes it easy for you to scan the page?

### Full

- Notes
    
    I think it’s very similar. But the first layout I guess visually catches my attention. Having the video at the top, so that I know what type of a creator they are, I guess… It’s just visually more attractive to me.
    

### Few

- Notes
    
    I still like the first one, even with less information.
    
    Maybe banners are too large? The top one? Just so that I can arrive to the token information sooner, without scrolling for so long.
    

### Empty

- Notes
    
    Given that it’s empty, I guess the second options now makes sense.
    

## 2. Describe

- [x]  What is the most important information that youre looking for when you open a token page?
- Notes
    
    I wanto to see what the latest price was. I appreciate seeing how it changes over time (chart). Obviously, a description of what the creator is doing, etc. I guess description goes first, and right after that, price? Also, holders, how many are there. 
    
    Most of the time, you probably buy tokens when they’re *airdropping*, when the price is low.
    

- [x]  Please describe everything that you see and how you understand while browsing this page - you can click now
- Notes
    
    Banner, channel name, tabs for navigating different parts of the channel page…
    
    Then we have the token name, I guess?
    
    I don’t understand the Rev Split nor the Patronage.
    
    Then we have buy/sell, token price…
    
    Then we have Channel revenue? Is this how much they make? I don’t really understand the first two statistics. The total transaction volume I understand, because we have that other platform (Mint Me [?]).
    
    My guess, for the Rev Split, is that this is what… is being split in Joystream? No, I don’t understand.
    

## 3. Page elements

- [ ]  Now we will take a closer look at some of the elements on the page

### Token header

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element?
- Notes
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the revenue split information?
- Notes
- [ ]  On a scale from 1/10 how important is for you information about token verification?
- Notes

### Price widget

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    150K is… I guess that’s a price in JOY? I don’t know. I don’t know what this price is in. 
    
    And then there’s a total supply of this tokens.
    
    And then you can sell or buy this token.
    
    *[Reading the tooltip for the AMM sale type]* I’m confused by that. Are you minting them when you’re buying them? Is this what you meant? I don’t know, I’m confused.
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the price? (AMM state)
- Notes
    
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the total supply? (AMM state)
- Notes
    
    I can’t say I know what is the relevance of the total supply information. I hope to learn that one day. But for now I don’t know how is this information helpful to me.
    

### Statistics

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
- [x]  Please tell me more about those pills with percentages - what is that?
- Notes
    
    It wasn’t obvious to me before I hovered over the pills and learned that it’s change over 7 days.
    

### Holders

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    Going further, there’s top holders… 700K, that is how much they contributed? And the Vested TRS is something I don’t understand. And then, the rest of the table, the Total TRS is probably how much each of the holder has, and the percentage of the all tokens? So it seems like the creator only holds 7%? That’s weird to me, it doesn’t make any sense to me.
    
    Maybe I would appreciate having a dashboard that’s showing me how is this token distributed across everybody? I don’t know.
    
    **Vesting? No, I don’t know what it is.**
    
    *[Having Kuba explained what vesting is in Joystream]* Oh, we have something like that in MintMe, but it’s not called vesting. 
    
- [x]  In the table there are percentages - do you know what they represent?
- Notes
    
    I guess percentages mean this is how much each of the holder has from the total pool? That was my first guess.
    
- [x]  If you open this token page and there are 200 holders of that token how many of them should be presented here on the main page?
- Notes
    
    Top 10 or top 20 sounds reasonable, as a number of holders to be displayed in that holders widget.
    

## States

- [ ]  Now we will talk about states (present the states prototype)
- [ ]  Each screen I would like you to take a pause and describe for me how you understand that particular state - what changed

### State 1

- Notes
    
    

### State 2

- Notes
    
    36K TRS? I guess that’s how many tokens have been sold in this in this sale round? But I’m not sure who is selling the token right now. Becuase it says it’s a Public sale I’m going to guess it’s the creator selling the token here.
    
- [ ]  Additional: Please rate for me the importance 1/10 of all informations in price widget now when we have new information presented - price/tokens/time/supply
- Notes

### State 3

- Notes
    
    I can see this token is verified.
    
    And there’s no active sale, but does it mean that holders can’t sell it back? But I would not like to be forced to hold it, it wouldn’t be nice.
    

### State 4

- Notes
    
    I guess this creator is only selling to the people they approved? That’s very intersting. Why would creator do that?
    
    I don’t think I’m whitelisted, because there’s a button showing me how to get whitelisted.
    

### State 5

- Notes
    
    Oh, and now I’m on the whitelist.
    

### State 6

- Notes
    
    I’m familiar with this. I’m a musician and my music is on a platform called Rockie(?), and there’s staking and burning… 
    
    If I hit the Stake button, I would expect for it to pay me the interest, depending on how many people… (?).
    
- [ ]  How do you understand stake action - what will happen if you click this? Why is it displayed for you?
- Notes

## Purchase

- [ ]  Please buy the token and describe everything aloud
- Notes
    
    I don’t know what token we’re buying this in. I’m guessing JOY.
    
    Oh, ok, it is JOY. *[Having seen the summary.]*
    
    Ok, this is pretty straightforward to me.
    
    *Clicks on Continue, takes his time to read the tooltips aloud, and scan the entire dialog visually*
    
    Ok, so it seems that those 11 dollars that I just bought are going to be issued to me over 7 months? And then, I guess will get the initial payout after one month. And within the cliff period I won’t receive anything. 
    
    **This is very interesting. I don’t know how is this helping creators, nor how is this helping buyers.**
    
    *Clicks on Buy*
    
    There’s a welcome message and a link to the project’s community I guess.
    
- [ ]  How was it for you to purchase the token that way?
- Notes

## Final

- [ ]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask  about?
- Notes
    
    Would I be able to port my tokens over to Joystream? I would love to be able to create tokens on every platform. My idea of web3 is that everything lives in your wallet…
