    Analog time(?) blockchain is something he’s currently exploring, other than this he’s mostly “using” the DeSo blockchain.

# 2. Task & Questions

### Buying

- [x]  Tell me more about your experience while buying tokens on DESO
- Notes
    
    Generally, I don’t have complains. It’s a good technology. The problem i see with creator coin is that it’s versatile, it’s not wide. You can’t use it so much. You can’t transfer creator tokens to someone else. You can only buy and sell them. Imagine you can do more with creator coin. This can give your coins more value.
    
    If people can use my coin to purchase nike products would give that way more value. Right now, people just buy and invest. Eg. you have a coin and I buy your coin. And I have a right to sell it later. But then you might be angry at me, because it will lower the value of your coin. Because the price of your coin will drop. The reason it’s this way is because they don’t have much use case. Imagine you can trade them on exhanges, that would give them more value.
    
    Right now, the creator coin market is very poor[?]. 
    
    DeSo don’t really give responses [?]. If creator coins are able to implement a very good use case for them, that would be great.
    
    Buying coins directly is a [?] process. I have deso in my account. I go to your profile. I can buy your coin. And I input 2 deso. It gives me the total value of your coin. **It’s very very fast and there isn’t a problem with that.**
    
- [x]  What are you looking for when investing in a new coin? How do you make sure its a good investment and that you want to invest in this particular one?
- Notes
    
    *Is the price you’re getting fair?* There are two things I look at when purchasing coincs. There’s a founder reward (FR). I’m eager to invest in someone who I believe in. Price doesn’t matter if you believe in someone/something. So the founder reward: how much coin you’re getting back. That’s what matters.
    
- [x]  While buying, the tokens have some price do you know where this price come from? What do you think about it -does it make sense for you that this price is set this way? is it fair?
- Notes
- [x]  What will scare you away from buying the token - is there any particular thing that if you see that - you dont invest at all?
- Notes
    
    Scams. You need to look at who you are investing in. Investing in wrong people.
    
- [x]  As a buyer how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that token prices behave on DESO?
- Notes
    
    4.5. I’ve had bad experiences, becuase when I entered Deso newly, I didn’t know so much. When you invest with no guidance. As time went on, I started recognizing what’s right and wrong. But the beginnings were bad. I used to invest in scammers, and I lost my money. That was not a good experience. Now it’s good, because I put my money in the right creator coins.
    
- [x]  Have you ever invested in any project really early when the price is really low? Have you ever invested in a project late when the price is high? Do you feel any tension caused by the fact that if you don’t invest early enough it might be too late?
- Notes
    
    No. I haven’t. But I did invest in projects that were late and the price were high. I’ve been doing this for the last 2 years [?]. *Then he brought up the Solana example.* 
    
    As an investor, if I wasn’t an early buyer of a creator coin which price has gone very high……. *And then he drifted away again in explaining how it is to be an investor and how important it is to invest in the right people.*
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience from any purchase?
- Notes
    
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of buying the coins?
- Notes
    
    Yes. Yes. There are factors that could make things better. No good utility for the creator coin market is one of the factor that could be better. You don’t have a lot of reasons to invest in someone right now. The only reason you might want to invest in someone in DeSo is only if they’re here for a long run. Coins are stagnant. They don’t really move. Also the user base is rather low at this point. 
    
    The market is going to boom once DeSo implement more use cases for creator coins.
    
    If I make a hundred dollar, I can allocate it in [?]. I want to give my coins to my [brothers?!] to make them feel better. [?]
    
- [x]  From the buyer perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes

### Selling

- [x]  What is your token name?
- Notes
    
    AnthonyUmeora
    
- [x]  Tell me more about your experience of selling your own token?
- Notes
    
    I’m giving value to people outside of the platform. As it stands, there’s this guy from South Africa which I talked to. He was looking for ways to make his creator coin more valuable. Actually, every creator tries to make their coins more valuable. What this guy does it, is [?]. 
    
    I don’t plan on selling any of my creator coins yet. I don’t want to pull anyone down *yet* [XD].   
    
    People don’t buy my tokens directly from me. If you go to my profile, you just see “buy”. Buying from *me*, means send my your money and I send you my token. Right now, people buy from AMM. 
    
    I only own six pieces of my coin right now.
    
    **I wouldn’t be able to sell someone a crazy amount of my tokens, becuase I, for example, could not afford it to buy and mint it in the first place. That’s why I appreciate the AMM.**
    
- [x]  When selling, the tokens have some price set by the platform - what do you think about this price - does it make sense for you?
- Notes
    
    The more people buy the more price increases. Example: someone buys my coin, this person adds value to my coin. The only problem with DeSo is that it’s a slow process. Because there are not enough users. But we’ll get there.
    
- [x]  As a seller how happy on a scale from 1 to 10 you would say you are with the way that platform sets price for your token?
- Notes
    
    I’m very happy with it because there more people buying into coins. Most people on deso right now are for a long term [?]. 
    
    Poeple have bought and sold my tokens, yes. But generally, I’m very happy with how things are right now.
    
- [x]  As a seller you cannot customize anything if it comes to the sale of you coin does that bother you?
- Notes
    
    You can [?] actually send creator tokens to someone. We can’t use Coinbase in Africa. So I can’t even buy DeSo. So what I do is I send bitcoin over to my friend in the US so that he can buy me some DeSo. 
    
    I can only send DeSo someone on DeSo. I can’t sell my creator coins if you’re not on DeSo. I wish I would be able to sell/transfer my tokens outside of DeSo.
    
- [x]  How happy you are on 1-10 scale with the way the sale is handled for you?
- Notes
    
    It [what?] doesn’t bother me so much. The only thing I can change is the Founder Reward. But this is new to me. 
    
- [x]  Can you remember a dissapointing experience while selling your coin?
- Notes
    
    No. There haven’t been any. I haven’t received any complaints from anyone, so it’s been smooth.
    
- [x]  Is there anything that DESO could make better if it comes to experience of selling the coins?
- Notes
    
    DeSo has a lot of work to do when it comes to the tokenomics. They don’t really puch so much focus on the currency, which is DeSo. 
    
    The best thing to do for DeSo is doing a croschain with the Eth blockchain. That’s progress.
    
    Imagine being able to store your own KUBA coins on your wallet, so that you can do something with it. You can use BitCoin to buy Tesla. Imagine using KUBA coins with similar use cases. 
    
- [x]  From the seller perspective is there anything I didn’t ask about and you want to add?
- Notes
    
    Emmm, no. You’ve covered eveyrthing. The creator token market is not so large right now, it’s just DeSo right now. And DeSo isn’t very big yet. So everything you asked me covered creator tokens.
