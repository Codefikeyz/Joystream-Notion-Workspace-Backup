# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    I have yes
    

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    SO this is basicly like a type of wallet in a way
    1st thing that comes to mind is amount of reward that you can claim
    Like a dashboard to take a looka t your earnings
    Available reward Im guessing thats what youve accumulated that you can claim - idont know where that moves to I guess into my wallet extension
    NEXT ETA - in 3 days it raises the question where is it coming from
    Channel balance - withdraw - now that I see it it makes me think that this goes to the wallet and the previous one moves it to the balance
    TOTAL is just total
    Im guessing that the next one will come in 3 Days
    Hovers on tooltip on the first one 
    And gets confused
    T: Where do you think it comes from?
    ”I wonder, if this is for Atlas, Im guessing some type of staking haha streams paper stream or a some type of staking”
    Rewards - weird?? Just makes me wonder will that be like it will always be - or maybe based on views and creator tokens
    In any other platform to be a content creator it doesn’t work that way because you basically wait until someone recognizes your work - on other platforms you can earn your way up the ladder
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    So click on claim
    Reads...
    Reads...
    Reads tooltip
    THinks
    Okey the thing that throws me off is 900K - it means the maximum reward that you can get - the same way of thinking that this is the max cap
    I dont understand why you would have more after claiming
    I assume that platform is paying the fee for me
    Assumes based on amount in input
    Clicks confirm
    Yeah I dont understand that - based on wallet extension
    
    UUU what happened to the previous amount - was that withdrawn  automaticly - I assume they were withdrawn
    I think I had there 1M
    I dont know where they went
    Gives the answer about claimed amount 
    But still he is confused confused
    Positioning of total channel balance and its styling may be not enough to distinuish it from the rest of actions
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you know how much in total you’ve received from the council? How much was that?
- [ ]  Was everything clear for you?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Task 3: Please tell me, do you know when exactly is the next reward going to take place? When?**
- Notes
    
    The next reward in 3 days
    Si he thinks it will be on a specified date
    Is it every day?
    What does it depend on 
    The tenth of april will be the next reward so he gives the answer based on current date - 3 days from now
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    I do yeah xD Knowing it later than 3 days just knowing uuuh lets say... release the anxiety ... just even knowing that it takes at least 3 days for council to proceed
    

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    aaaah
    2 m and so on - reads the NFT sale  - nov 10 2021
    WHY info
    Changes because realizes that he is looking for a reward
    He tried to click on the reward row on claimed reward
    He expected the line to expand and show details
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Was that information in a place you would expect it to be?
- [ ]  Do you find that information useful?
- Notes
    
    No. I went through transaction history
    It takes my eyes here
    Once I found the item my first thought was to reveal the info here
    This one is not obvious for me
    

- [ ]  **Q: Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience on this page?**
- Notes
    
    No I like the layout blablabla
    The only one obvoius was the see all rewards
    I like that there are filters too
    
    T:Is there any other information that you would expect in transaction history or is that enough for you.
    I dont know eeee ummmm I have a q i guess
    Q: The only reward that you can get are from the council? Can I tip other people?
