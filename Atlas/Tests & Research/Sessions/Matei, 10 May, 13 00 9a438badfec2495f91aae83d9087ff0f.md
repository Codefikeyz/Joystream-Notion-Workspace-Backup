# INTRODUCTION

1. Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.
2. Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.
- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    “No, Joystream — not.”
    

1. Before you start - there might be a situation where you will see the Polkadot extension widget. Don’t worry, the data is already filled with our test account and you don’t need to fill out your information. You just need to click “Sign the transaction” :)

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Imagine you are a new creator, you have posted some videos and I want you to go to the Payments page, play around with it and tell me what do you see, what do you think the pages are and what each section is about etc.**
- Notes
    - Finds the Payments page with no problems.
    - “Channel balance is my revenue for videos I uploaded and that are earning money for me. And I can have a balance here for the videos (NFT) I sell.”
    - “Council payout is a revenue that I can get for my activity on the platform.”
    - He is struggling to understand the Membership waller box, he thinks that the “123 021” is the NAME of the wallet (it’s a balance).

- [ ]  **Task 2 (new council payout appeared): I would like you to do the same thing you did in your first task. What do you think happened here? What changed?**
- [ ]  * Followup: How many tJOY do you have on your channel account now? (To see if they recognize that they have to claim it before it gets transferred to their account)
- Notes
    - “I can see I’ve been rewarded 1 mil tokens, which I can claim.”
    - “Currently, on my channel, I have 0 tJOYs, because I haven’t claimed the available payout. Once I claim that, it will be on my channel balance.”
    - “I imagine, that in order to claim the reward (it’s like a staking, basically), I need to provide my polkadot password, **and the tokens will go to my channel balance, so to my wallet basically.**” (!!!)

- [ ]  **Task 3: Claim 700 000 tJOY from your payout and transfer it to your membership account**
- [ ]  * Followup question: What do you think happened here?
- [ ]  * Followup question: How much was the transaction fee? Where was it deducted from?
- Notes
    - Finds the “Claim” button with no issues whatsoever.
    - Reads content of the dialog out loud, finds everything clear and intuitive.
    - Instantly notices that the numbers have changed in the top boxes and it’s clear to him how and why it happened.
    - “The balance history chart is actually useful. Very, very useful”.
    
    ---
    
    - Finds the “Withdraw” button very quickly.
    - Reads content of the dialog out loud, finds everything clear and intuitive, plus: “Ooooh, now I understand this was my balance in the last box”.
    - “Ok, and now these funds are available to me”.
    
    ---
    
    - “On the first step, I was rewarded a payout from the council, so I claimed then. Then these funds went to the Channel balance, and then I withdraw
    - He remembered the transaction fee, even when he was asked about it long after he closed that dialog.
    - When asked about what deducting the fee from the balance, he said he thinks the fee was deducted from his membership balance.

- [ ]  **Task 4: If you were looking for more information on your payout, where would you look for it?**
- [ ]  * Followup (if they enter the Council payouts tab): What do you think each column means?
- Notes
    - He answered: transaction history.
    - Then he did not understand the question.
    - Once he understood the question, he immediately answered “I would go to the Council payouts tab”.
    - When asked for an explanation of each of the table’s column:
        - Date and Block are clear.
        - The Amount is clear.
        - The “Payout total” — he paused for a while, but after a while he was able to
        - “And the <<Details>> is basically the message from the Council to me, on why I have received this reward.”
        

“It’s easy, very very easy. And I like the graphics, and the colors.”
