Description for set up token is misleading

Token ticker doesn’t know what it is

Doesn’t understand patronage

Graph is not understandable to him 

Cliff apply to me and vesting to buyers

Allocation does not know what that mean

If he would create his own token he would rather have no vesting and cliff

He does not understand revenue split

Doesnt understand AMM

AMM needs more explanation
