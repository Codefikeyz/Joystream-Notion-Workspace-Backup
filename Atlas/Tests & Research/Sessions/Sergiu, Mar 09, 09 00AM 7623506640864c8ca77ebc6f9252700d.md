# 3. Task

- [ ]  **(Task 1) Create a new video and add subtitle file to it**
    - Notes
        
        Opens the video
        Scans the first page
        Extends the more button
        Clicks next and stops because he didn’t select the language of the video
        So has to come back and looks for the language
        Should be somewhere in the first screen 
        Reads caption certification - these are the options for the caption certification
        Now can add subtitles
        Now adds subtitles efforlesly 
        Checks the video is the video is in sync with the sound
        Tries to edit caption
        Stumbles on taking longer than expected dialog
        We can edit it inside the
        Finds upload another file 
        
        I dont think I can add two types of languages in the video
        Right here we select language of video and captions will be automaticly added
        
        Not really hard to discover this on your own
        

How was it for you:

Not particularly hard to create it - likes automaticly added subtitles by youtube

Closed captions and subtitles
I dont know - if guess subtitle is basicly a translation and caption I dont know
