# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. Creating the token

- [x]  Please create your own channel token & as you go describe for me how you understand all concepts that will be presented to you on each screen
- Notes
    - **Step 1:**
        - (Seeing the Whitelist option) Ooh, that’s interesting, I like that.
        - The whitelisted thing caught my eye. I just want to do my thing, have supporters.
        - (Clicks on Learn more button) Maybe I would see more description on what I’m doing here and what each of the setting is.
        - It seems pretty straightforward to me. I just follow the steps, fill out the fields. I like it, it’s pretty simple.
        - I don’t understand Patronage. Will I get rewarded just by managing the token properly? That would be my guess.
        - I would love to bring my token over here. I mean, I already have a token, I don’t need a second one.
    - **Step 2:**
        - (Reading the description and thinking aloud) So if I buy a token, will it be locked for 2 months? Or if people buy my token it will be locked for 2 months?
        - (Takes a longer while to go through the page while struggling to understand what it’s about)
        - If I create a token, I’m guessing, for 3 months nothing happens. And then after 3 months I get that 2 thousand tokens? No, wait, I’ll get it in 2 years.
        - So the cliff period is 3 months, right? And then, thorough 2 years I’m getting 10 000 TRS. But, wow, like how does that happen? How is it released? Monthly? I have no idea.
        - (Trochę wyduszone i naprowadzane :D) **I think these terms would apply to a creator, which is me. So I’ll have more tokens available to sale over the course of 2 years.**
- **Step 3:**
    - (Looking at the transaction fee amount) So it costs to create your token? I guess it makes sense if I want to bring my token on chain.
    - Yeah, this looks pretty straightforward.
    - (Creates token)
    - (Seeing the dialog) I’d go straight to the “Open token page”. Right away I’d want to see how my token looks like, so that’s why I’d go straight to the token page.

## 2. Token dashboard

- [x]  What would be the next action that you would take right now?
- Notes
    - *Notes below*
    
- [x]  Please analyze the whole page and describe to me how you understand the concepts presented on it
- Notes
    - I’d first observe the dashboard by going through all cards in the “Your progress” section. I’d scroll it. Just to make sure I complete this bar, I guess.
    - And then I’d go and explore every single tab and learn through them, learn how to read the dashboard.
    - Can I personalize my dashboard?
    - I’m guessing this dashboard is like any other dashboard.
    - Man, this is interesting, it makes me realise we’re not just creators anymore, we need to provide some economics for our tokens. There’s a steep learning curve.
    - After I’ve explored the page my next action would be to go to the next stab, explore other tabs, make sure I understand tokens settings, and then I would edit token page to make it nice
    

## 3. Edit the token page

- [x]  Edit your token page. Add a video intro, one benefit, description and publish it.
- Notes
    - (Selects video effortlessly)
    - I don’t even know what that (Benefits) is, I don’t understand. I’m guessing that this is some type of locked access, like granting access to sime kind of locked contents. I just don’t know what kind of benefits I can have. I would hope this is up to us to decide.
    - Then I’d describe my token, what I’m doing and I’d throw the benefits.
    - **This part, man, (pointing at the Patronage value), explain this part to me (laughs).**
    - (Looking at the values in tokens statistics on the right-hand side) What currency are these values in? Is this JOY? I see a smile, so I’m guessing this must be JOY. That would make perfect sense to me.
    - (Clicks on “Publish”). Go to token page? What is that, I’m guessing it’s the public page. I mean, this is my dashboard, so the token page must be the public one.
    

## 4. Sales

- [x]  Please tell me what the differences between public sale and AMM and how you understand it
- Notes
    - **Sale type:**
        - On “MintMe” (?), when there’s an AMM, other token holders can just come and sell their tokens. Whereas here it seems to me that token holders can only sell their tokens to someone else?
        - I’d hope there’s a lot of reading here, as I feel like I rushed to create a token and I wish I would have some more information on that. **There’s a lot of education needed for creators to become token managers.**
        - I wouldn’t know which sale type to choose.
        - Having a small group of supporters that really believe in me, I would instinctively go with the Creator sale.
        - I would definitely click on “Learn more” buttons. I would click on all of them. I noticed them on all the pages I’ve seen.

### AMM

- [x]  Sell your token on AMM and describe to me every concept that is presented to you and how you understand it
- Notes
    - **Step 1:**
        - I’m not too clear on this one. Like, how are they (buyers) minting them? By buying them? I guess I don’t understand minting then? I mean, I’ve heard the word many times but it’s not clear to me in this context.
        - I don’t what I would do with terms & conditions. I guess I’d have to figure out what’s the value of my tokens and present it. I guess I wouldn’t want to *undervalue* or *overvalue.*
        - Why would I have to set the token price? Isn’t it set by the AMM?
    - **Step 2:**
        - Ok, so when they buy my token they have it released little by little…
        - See, this is the part that us, creators, will have a very hard time at.
        - It’s so complex. There’s a lot of reading. There’s a learning curve.
        - It would be cool to see how much they’d be buying to see what would those percentages be…
        - Can I change these settings over time?
    - **Step 3:**
        - See, I would read all these. I love that you guys have these little information bubbles.
        - (Starts the sale)

## Final

- [ ]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask about?
- Notes
    
    

# 5. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Thank the participant and request the wallet address

8:40 Patronage

14:30 Your starting tokens
We lack information how often the tokens will be released

17:30 - Who does this apply to 

if there is more demand for token than you have what to do then - this question arises at the point of your starting tokens 

We should inform creators about two types of making money with token when issuing token

After creating token go through tabs and then edit token page

42:20 - sale types - he understands AMM as it would be an AMM with liquidity pool just as on uniswap

46:30 - I wouldn't know what to choose

Confused about minting - are users minting & buying at the same time?
