# 1. Introduction

- [x]  Welcome & thank you part, what’s your name, etc.
- [x]  Briefly mention what is the subject of the study,
- [x]  Recording
- [x]  Confirm the answers to the questionarie
- **Notes**
    
    Regarding BitCloud, I heard about it first time many months ago, when it was initially launched. It had limited access to the platform at the time. I might have created an account, but it was long time ago, so I’m not really sure. But I’m sure that when I saw this platform I tried to understand how creators can mint their tokens. 
    
    **I’m not sure I know the mechanics of how creators monetise their tokens, nor where those tokens come from.** But I know that if you’re really famous in the offline world and that if you have an account on BitCloud, then your token will be worth a lot since day one.
    
    Many years ago I used St[?] platform, and it was a social network founded by the EOS (?) creator, his name is Larry (?). He’s a famous guy in the blockchain space… *Then you stopped him.*
    

# 2. Task & Questions

## 1. A/B

- [x]  Please don’t click anything for now and focus on layout - which one of the two makes it easy for you to scan the page?

ℹ️ *We could use some more extensive introduction to this page next time around. That it’s a video platform, it’s the channel page, etc. Thinking aloud, etc.*

### Full

- Notes
    
    If this is the goal of the page [showing the first two widgets on the A version], then maybe you could use more enhanced version, I would say.
    
    *When asked about what is the main information he would be looking for when reviewing a creator token, as an investor: [doesn’t answer].*
    
    I think I like the version A more. Because it’s the same thing, but the information is more concentrated. And I like when all information that I need is in one view and I don’t have to scroll a lot.
    

### Few

- Notes
    
    Difficult choice.
    

*ℹ️ Should we provide built-in A/B buttons to allow participants to quickly switch through versions? Because of page jumping.*

### Empty

- Notes
    
    Well, for this particular page I think that I like version B more. Probably there are people who would love to see more technical things, like tables.
    

## 2. Describe

- [x]  What is the most important information that youre looking for when you open a token page?
- Notes
    
    This information should refer to the general token information, then to the token statistics, then some utilities. And, of course, it’s important to have this Buy button.
    
    The top 3 information I think are important to me would be:
    
    1. Price,
    2. Total supply,
    3. Total market cap, which I don’t see on this page,
    4. And the benefits. But the benefits, I can imagine, somehow relate to the Rev Split and Patronage. For me, the Rev Split should be one of the benefits, I would expect it to see in the list.

- [x]  Please describe everything that you see and how you understand while browsing this page - you can click now
- Notes
    
    *[Seeing the revelaed Statistics panel]* I would love to see change in the circulation and change in the token price, so that I understand if a particular token hasn’t skyrocketed yesterday, which would not be good to me. A
    
    I can see the revenue split, but I have no idea where this revenue comes from. It would be great to see the history of payouts, so that I can see, on average, how much in US dollars would I have been earning over the past month or year.
    
    *He did not know that numbers presented in Statistics were in $JOY*
    
    *[Then he goes back to the first panel]* I’m not sure if I understand what does the Pateronage mean, but I guess it’s good that it’s set to 0.
    
    *[Then he looks at the price widget]* It’s hard to understand whether the price is in JOYs, tJOYs or US dollars. 
    
    *[Looking at the AMM tooltip]* I don’t know… Maybe it’s somehow related to the bounding curve.
    
    *[Looking at the statistics section]* It’s unclear to me how is the channel generating revenue. And I don’t understand what “Total revenue splits” is. And “Total transaction volume” I would guess is just how much of this token has been sold or bought.
    
    *[Looking at the Holders widget]* Ok, here, this table seems to be pretty simple. I can see the TOP 20 holders, and I can see Vested TRC tokens, and… I don’t understand what are vesting terms. For how long will those tokens be locked up, for example… I would be interested to know more about vesting terms. And to learn more about that, I would click on the “Show more” button, expecting to see more information on this. 
    

## 3. Page elements

- [x]  Now we will take a closer look at some of the elements on the page

### Token header

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element?
- Notes
    
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the revenue split information?
- Notes
    
    My understanding is that I can benefit from having the token if (a) its price increases, (b) based on its revenue split, (c) knowing the benefits listed by the creator.
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important is for you information about token verification?
- Notes
    
    I would mark it with 10/10. This is very important. I need to make sure the token is verified and that’s probably the first thing I need to make sure about it.
    
    I believe that if I would be considering buying a token for real, then I would def pay more attention to this information.
    

### Price widget

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the price? (AMM state)
- Notes
    
    Well, that’s a good question. If the token price is high then it’s really important to me. **But if the price is rather reasonable**, → **then** ← I would probably check the total supply, then I would look for the graph with the history of token price change and the total supply change.
    
- [x]  On a scale from 1/10 how important for you is the total supply? (AMM state)
- Notes

### Statistics

- [x]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
- [x]  Please tell me more about those pills with percentages - what is that?
- Notes

### Holders

- [ ]  Please tell me how you understand that element
- Notes
    
    
- [x]  In the table there are percentages - do you know what they represent?
- Notes
    
    Yeah, I think… Wait, no. I thought I knew what this number is about. I was expecting that this number is the total percentage of the supply, but the numbers on the mockup are incorrect, so I’m not sure. *[Turned out, it were the numbers on the prototype being inaccurate, so he DID get the idea right the first time around].*
    
    *ℹ️ Let’s make sure to align numbers on the prototype next time around.*
    
- [x]  If you open this token page and there are 200 holders of that token how many of them should be presented here on the main page?
- Notes
    
    I think there are about 12 holders presented right now in the widget, which I think is the perfect number. I guess I don’t care about guys who have less than 1% of the token.
    

## States

- [ ]  Now we will talk about states (present the states prototype)
- [ ]  Each screen I would like you to take a pause and describe for me how you understand that particular state - what changed

### State 1

- Notes
    
    I think the sale type is different than in State 2. Now it says it’s an AMM. I think it means that the owner will not get 100% of the profits from this sale. Probably, when I buy a token in this sale, then its price will increase. I also guess that other participants will also get some revenue from me buying this token now.
    
    *[Having explained possible revenue streams on Joystream by Kuba]* Well, in the usual AMM system, people would get a portion of the fees from people who make transactions…
    

### State 2

- Notes
    
    I’m assuming that we’re in the token sale mode and it will end in 12 hours, I can see the number of tokens on sale, but I can not see how much tokens have left. I don’t know if the “Tokens on sale” is the total number of tokens that have been put on sale, or whether this is how much is left.
    
    I guess I would love to see some graph showing me how much tokens have been sold already. This would help me asses whether I should make a purchase right now, or whether it’s okay for me to wait a little more.
    
    *[Noticing the Public sale]* I think it’s a quick sale in which the owner will receive 100% of the sale.
    
- [ ]  Additional: Please rate for me the importance 1/10 of all informations in price widget now when we have new information presented - price/tokens/time/supply
- Notes

### State 3

- Notes
    
    I can see there is now no option to buy the token. It’s all I can see. This, and also that the token is now verified.
    

### State 4

- Notes
    
    Here I can see two changes… *[Clicked on the whitelist req button]* This is not really clear for me right now…
    
    What I can see is that I need to be whitelisted to buy this token, and I can also see the requirements I need fulfil to buy this token.
    
    I think I’m definitely not on the whitelist in this state *[he made this comment having seen State 5 before]*
    

### State 5

- Notes
    
    I can see that now I’m on the whitelist. It seems to be pretty good. I can understand it.
    

### State 6

- Notes
    
    It seems I need to stake my tokens to get the revenue. Right now I’m not sure if it’s really convenient for me to repeat this action to get profits. 
    
    *[When asked about the “All tokens are paused” message]* Yeah, I think this is pretty clear to me. But I’m still not sure how staking is related to pausing the sale.
    
- [ ]  How do you understand stake action - what will happen if you click this? Why is it displayed for you?
- Notes

## Purchase

- [ ]  Please buy the token and describe everything aloud
- Notes
    
    I think I would like to see some help menus to help me understand what does the Platform or Transaction fee mean. But other than this, I think this is pretty clear.
    
    *[Having proceeded to the next step]* ooooh!
    
    Unlockable content? What is this? I don’t understand that. Probably this is a link to some additional extra content that I just bought. I hope so, at least.
    
    Seeing the Discord link I thought I would need to be involved in some discussion, conversation, so that misled me a bit. Instead, I think I was expecting to see the confirmation of what I bought.
    
- [ ]  How was it for you to purchase the token that way?
- Notes
    
    Uniswap, 1inch — all the swap services have a very similar interface and flow for purchasing a token. I was expecting for this UI to be matching my prior experiences.
    

## Final

- [ ]  Do you have any final thoughts or do you want to add anything that I didn’t ask  about?
- Notes
    
    Uniswa[p, One inch
