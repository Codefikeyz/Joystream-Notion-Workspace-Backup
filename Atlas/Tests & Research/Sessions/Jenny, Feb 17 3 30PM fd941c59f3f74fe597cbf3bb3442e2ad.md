# 2. Intro to the app

<aside>
⚠️ Only for the participants who said they’re not familiar with the app OR they’re not familiar with web3 concepts

</aside>

- [x]  Ask for questions.
- Notes

# 3. Tasks & questions

- [x]  **Introduction:**
    - [x]  Share a link to a Figma prototype, explain the technical details,
    - [x]  Explain what is the subject of the study,
    - [x]  *Imagine yourself just joined the platform and found an interesting video you’d like to comment for the very first time. There are a couple of tasks we would like you to perform to see if the UI is intuitive and clear enough.*
    - [x]  Mention acting like we’re not here,
    - [x]  Mention thinking-aloud protocol,
    - [x]  Mention that it’s the prototype that’s being tested, not the test subject,
    - [x]  Mention that we’re not looking for flattering answers.
    - Notes
        
        Haven’t participate in usability test before 
        I understand that this prototype is just to get reviews 0.0
        Wow looks cool I like it
        This is exciting 
        You can choose the reaction this is cool
        
- [x]  **Question 1: Sorting**
*1. How do you think comments are sorted right now?
2. Do you think you can change that?
3. How do you thank would affect the comments you added?*
    - Notes
        1. Based on the date on when they’re posted
        
        Oh no wait a moment
        
        They are sorted by the amount of reactions
        
        Most famous ones are on the top
        Ah yes there is the most popular here - when finds the way to change sorting
        When I add comment I think that it should be on the bottom yeah thats my answer
        Its confusing the comment box is on the bottom
        
        more often I use mobile device
        
- [x]  **Task 1: Add a comment in the main thread**
*Can I ask you to simply add a new comment under the video? Say “I like this video a lot!”
Heads up: Because it’s a Figma prototype, comments are going to be prepopulated.*
    - Notes
        
        Clicks on the field
        Clicks comment
        So comments are processed on chain
        Waiting waiting 
        Where did my comment go 
        Ah its there its on the top
        To be honest - because the coment is simple and short - I think that its a hustle because its on chain - I do not see and understand why it needs to be on chain
        I realized that this is on chain when this window po up with polkadot 
        For a simple task of commenting maybe for me probably I would prefer this not to be on chain maybe longer messages can be on chain but so short ones 
        Came to my thinking that not all long msgs are relevant - so why that is neede to be on chain too
        Overall user tends to lean towards keeping comments off chain 
        
- [x]  **Task 2: Add a reply to a comment that already has some replies**
*Can I ask you to add a comment as a reply to the acuate_anton’s comment? Say “good points!”*
    - Notes
        
        Ive seen this kind of interface  in other platform
        Hits reply
        Proceeds with adding a comment successfully 
        It’s easy for me this time
        Expresses again that this is on chain and she does not agree
        Asks if you can edit or delete if something is on chain
        She says that: as far as I know when you do something on chain then something that you do is inreversable
        If this would be finite - it would affect me to be more hesitant to add new comments, if I would be a first time user, and be very carefull I would hesitate to add a new comment due to the nature of crypto and its connection to finances
        It is seen on the comment box that your comment will be stored on chain - notices on 2nd comment - probably if Im doing this alone I would notice it by myself
        
- [x]  **Task 3: Add a reply to a reply**
*Can I ask you to add a reply to bittyarlen’s comment?*
    - Notes
        
        Read the comment
        
        Let me add a comment
        
        Clicks and proceeds 
        OK so I did it 
        It match my expectations 
        I was able to quickly see where it is
        
- [x]  **Question 2: Commenting**
*Based on this prototype, how often would you imagine yourself commenting videos in Atlas, compared to how often you currently comment videos on YouTube or other social media platforms, in general? Less often, more often, or would it be about the same?*
    - Notes
        
        more often from my side i think Im subjective because I support this project
        If I wouldnt be a supporter - I think maybe less because of the on chain thing
        It takes some time to do it
        
- [x]  **Task 4: Adding reactions**
*Can you see the comment from the member named abrupt_tammy (2nd from the top)? How do you think other people feel about this comment? Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction to it?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 1: Undoing a reaction**
    *If you were to change your mind and wanted to undo this reaction, do you think you can do that? How would you do that?*
    - [x]  **Subtask 2: Adding a new reaction**
    *Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction once again, but this time to the comment below, from the user called “morniniglikesbar”?*
    - Notes
        
        Theyre happy with it , thay agreaa
        Clicks heart
        Read dialog
        Says: oh interesrting, again
        OK so it is again stored on chain and needs you to sign transaction
        It’s cool to have it - but again its a very little task but you have to do all of this signing
        It would be suprising that reactions are also stored on tha blockchain - even though we added a comment on blockchain a second ago
        
        To undoo she clicks again on heard and proceeds
        I do not see it as a necesity for it to be on a blokchain
        Its kind of new to me - but i expected it to be removable 
        
        She clicks the emoji button and adds heart succesfully
        
- [x]  **Question 3: Reactions**
*Imagine that YouTube introduces reactions to comments in the same way you just experienced it in the prototype. How would that affect how often you react to other people's comments: less often, or more often, or would it stay the same? Why?*
    - Notes
        
        On chain or not?
        (not on chain because its on youtube)
        I honestly don’t know Im sorry xD
        
- [x]  **Question 4: Unlimited reactions**
*1. Which reactions system do you see yourself using more often, compared to each other?
2. How do you think people feel like about the first comment, based on two versions?
3. Which option makes it easier for you to quickly see how do people feel about different comments?*
    - Notes
        
        1.So many reactions says about B
        There is so many of them - she says when she opens an add emoji panel
        Im mind blown by these - there is so many reactions
        I think I would do more often A
        I dont know but I prefer the one with limited reactions
        It’s very cool that when people are given the opportunity to give a reaction that people want its very cool - and you can always hide into only 4 or 5 visible at the time - it is good 
        And I would like to have this kind of feature
        (Changes her mind!) as long as there will be a lot less shown at the time when you 
        
        2.More positive on B, If you will look at the numbers then yeah A, 
        
        3. The option A, but she refers to differences in amounts between two prototypes, thus its not equal 
        

### Unexpected questions scenario

In case the participant asks about a feature that was not included in the scope, the following questions should be used:

1. Is this something you would expect to be able to do?
2. Would the lack of this feature somehow affected your willingness to use the commenting system on Atlas?

# 4. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Open mic. Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience with comments on Atlas?
- [ ]  Ask for a Polkadot wallet address, or a Joystream member handle/ID.
- [ ]  Thank the participant for taking part in the study and ask if we can reach out in the future.
- Notes
    
    Its cool that we show avatars next to comments
    But why only 3
    Not sure why we have only two avatars when we have 4 replies
