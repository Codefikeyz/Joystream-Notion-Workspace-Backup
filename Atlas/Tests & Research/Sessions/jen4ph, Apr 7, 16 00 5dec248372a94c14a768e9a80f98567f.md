# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
T: Test before?
    
    I did one before :)
    I have uploaded several of them.
    

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    When I look at it it seems that I have uploaded some videos that are generating some income because I can asee the numbers
    On the top I have 4 notifications
    I have available reward
    Reaqds tooltip
    Somehow the working group are not able to reward me but will reward me as soon as there will be a budget 
    No blocks in ETA but days
    Channel balance - 1,5 K I can witdraw even though I have a reward that is much higher value
    Total earnings are confusing - it doesn’t add up - cant explain why feels unsecure that she doesn’t understand
    forgive me forgive me
    ...silence...
    She looks at the page - scroll around
    By looking at the numbers it looks like they are not correctly calculated
    
    T: Channel balance weird?
    Maybe because I can see the reward but I can only withdraw 1,5K so she thinks that she can withdraw 1,5K from 770K - so that those two numbers are related
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    She opens the dialog
    And she proceeds a little bit without reading when dialog opens
    
    OOO ok
    So now I have claimed the reward and somehow the amount here is transfered here and it looks like I can withdraw all of it now
    Based on the tooltip that I saw before
    The working group budget has to be replenished
    Thats why I was able to claim it
    
    T: How much working group gave you?
    - 770 K
    
    T:Does this sound weird for you or confusing?
    - Yes because the working group is responsible for my payout and it can be delayed. I feel a bit unsecure about that. I think payments should not be delayed.
    
    She doesn’t understand that the reward is just a part of earnings.
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you know how much in total you’ve received from the council? How much was that?
- [ ]  Was everything clear for you?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Task 3: Please tell me, do you know when exactly is the next reward going to take place? When?**
- Notes
    
    In at least 3 days
    So I have to wait 3 days at least
    She hovers the tooltip
    
    T: How does it make you feel?
    Its fine. But you should have a fixed date on the week - wouldn’t that be better?
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    Looks at the table
    I got 770K hovers the row
    And I got it from NFT sale and NFT royalty
    In the transaction history
    It will show me transactions duh 
    She starts to filter
    She does not understand the concept 
    She cant find the see all button 
    She opens the dialog when instructed
    Wow
    She reads the description.
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Was that information in a place you would expect it to be?
- [ ]  Do you find that information useful?
- Notes
    
    I would look for it in transaction history to be honest
    Can I close it?
    THis box should focus only on timing
    

- [ ]  **Q: Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience on this page?**
- Notes
    
    She clicks withdraw
    When we withdraw?
    How does it happen?
    Do you make it bitcoin? She cant tell the currency 
    She cant tell where her money will go when she clicks withdraw.
    She doesn’t know if this will happen under channel or member
