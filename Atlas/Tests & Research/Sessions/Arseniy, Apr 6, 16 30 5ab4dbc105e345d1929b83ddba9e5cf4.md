# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    Yeah previously I got a channel with several to ten videos- I tested it and participated in some bounties and so on so I have some experience in content uploading
    

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    There is an ordinary table with payments & details & history of transaction
    I can see it on the right corner
    Available read - how much tokens I can claim right now
    I can transfer it to my account
    Next ETA - more than 3 days
    I have an opportunity to get tokens each claimable amount of time? and the next one will be in more than 3 days
    Channel balance - quantity of tokens that stays on special channel balance
    I don't exactly know what it is
    Filters for transaction history
    Reads all types of transactions
    ”Very useful, and clear to understand”
    blablabla
    Channel balance - I cant get an idea what it would be
    Maybe balance on your channel that will help you to rise it up and grow
    I understand 95% - only channel balance is not clear, & somehow next reward ETA
    Next ETA is a field that shows you how much time you have to wait until next claimable tokens will be available to you
    Channel balance??? is available reward???
    
    (Może channel balance oddzielnie nie w karcie tylko avatar + balance I button transfer to wallet)
    I could add some kind of picture with lines which shows you current progress and balance
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    OK - let me do it
    I need to click claim
    We want to claim all claimable balance
    Processes
    I need to sign the transaction
    Notices that in history there is his withdrawal
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you know how much in total you’ve received from the council? How much was that?
- [ ]  Was everything clear for you?
- Notes
    
    It was clear
    770K I got all the available quantity for me 
    Expands info at this time and reads tooltip
    I skipped it before because it's not huge
    It has some common sense
    

- [ ]  **Task 3: Please tell me, do you know when exactly is the next reward going to take place? When?**
- Notes
    
    Expands reward reposts
    Thinks that this is a schedule
    And starts to check when is the next one
    More than 3 days - anytime in the future but after 3 days from now
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    Yes its ok I CAN PLAN MY BUDGET ups capslock 
    
    Its less useful if I know exactly the date and time but more useful than having no information at all, no info is the worst situation, the best would be to get a schedule with a time and date
    

 xD
- co to za pytania mistrzu
Emergency and skip the checking for a while
 

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    I need to click see all 
    As I didi it previously and here is a list of rewards
    We can expand it and read it
    Last reward is 2 m and 423881
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Was that information in a place you would expect it to be?
- [ ]  Do you find that information useful?
- Notes
    
    Jak możesz powiedzieć że useful jak wcześniej w ogóle myślałeś że to rozkład spotkań council
    No - w końcu
    I would expect to find it in my list of activity - so merging two tables into one would be better
    

- [ ]  **Q: Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience on this page?**
- Notes
    
    Very user friendly przewiduje
    Color scheme I appreciate it its very very uuuuh comfortable for me
    Its strange that reports are triggered by this button and there is no such information in the first table
    Ideas for improving I don't know, here you go
    OOO user friendly mówiłem
    Powtórzył że nie podoba mu się gdzie się trigeruje reporty
