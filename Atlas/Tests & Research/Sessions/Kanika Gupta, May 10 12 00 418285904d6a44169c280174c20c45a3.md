# INTRODUCTION

1. Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.
2. Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.
- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    Wanted to, but been facing some problems, so: no. She couldn’t get through [???]. 
    
    From the sound of the answer, it seems like she couldn’t get through the process of creating a channel, or even a membership. 
    

1. Before you start - there might be a situation where you will see the Polkadot extension widget. Don’t worry, the data is already filled with our test account and you don’t need to fill out your information. You just need to click “Sign the transaction” :)

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Imagine you are a new creator, you have posted some videos and I want you to go to the Payments page, play around with it and tell me what do you see, what do you think the pages are and what each section is about etc.**
- Notes
    - Finds the Payments page with no problems,
    - “Assuming that this deals with something that I earn, and I assume I can make further transactions, because there’s a column for transaction.”
    - “If I receive anything, I
    - “I do not understand that Council Payout mean”,
    - Correctly understood the concept behind the Membership wallet widget in the Overview tab.
    - “Channel balance — is this what would I earn for a video? I don’t know. It’s not clear to me right now. It might mean what I have within this channel, perhaps. The studio where I upload content and therefore all earnings I have. Because in the membership wallet I might have earnings from other sources. That would be my guess.”
    - “Council payout — this would be exclusively dealing with the Council, it seems.”

- [ ]  **Task 2 (new council payout appeared): I would like you to do the same thing you did in your first task. What do you think happened here? What changed?**
- [ ]  * Followup: How many tJOY do you have on your channel account now? (To see if they recognize that they have to claim it before it gets transferred to their account)
- Notes
    - “I’m assuming there’s a reward that I need to press “Claim” in order to put that **IN MY WALLET**.”
    - Struggles to understand the difference between the Balance history and the Transaction history widgets.
    - “<<Last council payout>> seems ok, because this seem to reflect my dealings with the council.”
    - Asked about the amount of tokens she has on the channel account, she’s not sure where to look for this information.

- [ ]  **Task 3: Claim 700 000 tJOY from your payout and transfer it to your membership account**
- [ ]  * Followup question: What do you think happened here?
- [ ]  * Followup question: How much was the transaction fee? Where was it deducted from?
- Notes
    - Finds the right button and proceeds through the Claim dialog super quickly, asking no followup questions along the way.
    - “OK, <<channel balance>> which is what I claimed, and the the <<available council payout>> is what I still have left to claim”
    - “Now the source of income widget is clear to me”.
    - “Ok, now I understand that the Balance history will be some sort of a graph”.
    - “Now I’m a little more clear on what it all means”.
    
    ---
    
    - For the second part of the task, she finds the Withdraw button fairly quickly, although a bit hesitant if that’s the right one, then she proceeds through the Withdraw dialog — again — super quickly (not reading what’s inside) and, as a result, she manages to complete the task successfully
    - “It’s not entirely clear where did the council tokens come from to me.”
    - “Yes, I did notice I had to pay for transaction fees. I did not pay attention to them”.

- [ ]  **Task 4: If you were looking for more information on your payout, where would you look for it?**
- [ ]  * Followup (if they enter the Council payouts tab): What do you think each column means?
- Notes
    - “It still doesn’t tell me what gas fee I paid” (???)
    - Clicks through all the tabs randomly.
    - “I think I can gather more information through the Overview tab, rather than the Council payout tab.”
    - “If I needed more information on the past payout, I would look for it in the Council payouts tab.”
    - When asked about the meaning of each of the columns:
        - I don’t know what does the “Block” mean,
        - “I don’t know that the <<Payout total>> mean. Perhaps this is the total amount that the council has for a payout. And <<M>> — is that million? My best guess is that this is the amount that the council has deducted for the payout.”
        - “And the <<Details>> column is the reasoning behind why I received tokens”
