# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes
    
    I haven’t participated in this kind of tests
    
    Yes my wife uploaded, some videos to Joystream. I joined to joystream yesterday.
    I wanted to participate in it. I created a channel on joystream but haven’t upload any video yet but I will 😛
    

Alright, so we will give you 3 tasks. As you’re completing each task, please think out loud. Tell us what you see and what you’re thinking as you navigate through the app. Let us know when you’re uncertain or unconfident about what you’re looking at or what to expect.

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Click “start mission” and take a look at the displayed page. Don’t click anything, just tell us - what do you see and what do you think each section is about?**
- Notes
    
    Ok I see the channel
    Joystream channel and I see payments
    This is I think for videos yes
    I see NFT sales so you make videos as NFT and sell it
    Availiable reawd is the reward you can achieve for bounty or workshops group
    Next reward ok - in more than 3 days
    Channal balance this is the balance of the channel
    Total earnings is strange
    I thought its the earnings of the channel
    Is aable to diffrenciate only by the value of numbers 
    We can seed transaction history
    Date type - reads together 
    Scrolls the trancaction
    DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORD WITHDRAWAL
    (we are not putting it in your wallet👆 its important because you told him that we do 😛)
    Keep talking about workshop groups 
    

- [ ]  **Task 2: Claim the reward from the council.**
- Notes
    
    Claim the reward
    Sounds too strictly 
    Doesn’t know what to do
    Is confused a LOT A LOT - you had to guide him to the button
    Maybe placement of this button is in wrong place
    
    Available claim is 900K joys
    ”Your channel claim 900K but somebody in Joystream gives you 770K”
    ”I think I can claim 900K but I dont know”
    ”You have transaction fees prevent you from claiming 900K, but very close to it”
    Doesn’t know why he is claiming 770K keeps saying because someone from Joystream 
    
    Didn’t know at first its done
    And now notices its done
    And that there is new record in table and there is an updated balance
    You can claim reward to you channel balance
    Q: Available reward is this a part of uhh is it given ... dzięki za przerwanie xD to teraz się nie dowiemy czego nie zrozumiał jak mu wszystko wytłumaczyłeś 
    2Q: Why in avaialabe reward you can have only 900K now - maybe later it will be more
    - Why 900K why not less or more?
    Doesn’t understand what influence the height of award
    - If you have a very good channel your reward starts to grow, and then when your channel is bigger then you can claim more reward- thinks that this 900K is the max cap of possible claimable reward
    

Followup questions:

    Howers the tooltip
    Reads it
    No i dont know when exactly is the next reward
    NO
    I dont know that because on this block I dont see the range only that its more than 3 days
    

Followup questions:

- [ ]  Do you find that information useful for you in this case?
- Notes
    
    Ofcourse? Honestly I think its not usefull information - its the same like more than 1 day more than 10 days I dont find it usefull. Yes.
    

- [ ]  **Task 4: Could you please tell me how much did you get in your previous reward and what is the reason you got it?**
- Notes
    
    Description of the reward?
    Maybe on formums and on discord 
    T:If you only have this screen
    You can ofcourse see it in transactions - so he would look for that in the main table
    T:What do you think see all btn means
    Maybe I will find information about previous rewards and I can see the difference between previous reward and existing reward and try to calculate the range where I can get my next reward.
    Prototype breaks 😵
    ”Oh you can change code online? Yeah something like that”
    T:Is this something that you expected ?
    I think - he is not sure at all - feels a lot suggested by the Q
    T: Is there more information
    With this arrow I can find more information. Expands the report details
    He is suggested by the text - doesn’t understand the context
    ”To find a detailed information about amount of transaction” - why you earned 2 milion here 
    I see only it being marked by date - maybe it should be numbered like an id before the date
    

Followup questions:
