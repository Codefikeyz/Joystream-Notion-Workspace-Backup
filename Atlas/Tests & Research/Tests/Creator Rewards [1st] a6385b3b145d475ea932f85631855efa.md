# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.
