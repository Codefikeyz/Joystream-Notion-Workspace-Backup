    - [ ]  Explain what is the subject of the study,
    - [ ]  *Imagine yourself just joined the platform and found an interesting video you’d like to comment for the very first time. There are a couple of tasks we would like you to perform to see if the UI is intuitive and clear enough.*
    - [ ]  Mention acting like we’re not here,
    - [ ]  Mention thinking-aloud protocol,
    - [ ]  Mention that it’s the prototype that’s being tested, not the test subject,
    - [ ]  Mention that we’re not looking for flattering answers.
    - Notes
- [ ]  **(Task 1) Add a comment in the main thread**
*Can I ask you to simply add a new comment under the video? Say “I like this video a lot!”
Heads up: Because it’s a Figma prototype, comments are going to be prepopulated.*
    - Notes

*Can I ask you to add a comment as a reply to the acuate_anton’s comment? Say “good points!”*

*Can I ask you to add a reply to bittyarlen’s comment?*
    - Notes
- [ ]  **Task 4: Adding reactions**
*Can you see the comment from the member named abrupt_tammy (2nd from the top)? How do you think other people feel about this comment? Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction to it?*
    - [ ]  **Subtask 1: Undoing a reaction**
    *If you were to change your mind and wanted to undo this reaction, do you think you can do that? How would you do that?*
    - [ ]  **Subtask 2: Adding a new reaction**
    *Can I ask you to add a Heart reaction once again, but this time to the comment below, from the user called “morniniglikesbar”?*
    - Notes

# 4. Questions

- [ ]  **Question 1: Sorting**
*How do you think comments are sorted right now? Do you think you can change that? How do you thank would affect the comments you added?*
    - Notes
- [ ]  **Question 2: Commenting**
*Based on this prototype, how often would you imagine yourself commenting videos in Atlas, compared to how often you currently comment videos on YouTube or other social media platforms, in general? Less often, more often, or would it be about the same?*
    - Notes
- [ ]  **Question 3: Reactions**
*Imagine that YouTube introduces reactions to comments in the same way you just experienced it in the prototype. How would that affect how often you react to other people's comments: less often, or more often, or would it stay the same? Why?*
    - Notes
- [ ]  **Question 4: Unlimited reactions**
- *Which reactions system do you see yourself using more often, compared to each other?
- Which option makes it easier for you to quickly see how do people feel about different comments?*
    - Notes

### Unexpected questions scenario

In case the participant asks about a feature that was not included in the scope, the following questions should be used:

1. Is this something you would expect to be able to do?
2. Would the lack of this feature somehow affected your willingness to use the commenting system on Atlas?

# 5. Wrap-up

- [ ]  Open mic. Is there anything you’d like to add or say about your experience with comments on Atlas?
- [ ]  Ask for a Polkadot wallet address, or a Joystream member handle/ID.
- [ ]  Thank the participant for taking part in the study and ask if we can reach out in the future.
