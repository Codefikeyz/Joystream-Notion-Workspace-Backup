# INTRODUCTION

Before we begin, I have to ask you if you are okay with us recording this meeting? It will be helpful for us to be able to replay it if we forget something after the meeting.

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of our product. The purpose of the meeting is to test our new feature, Creator Rewards. Please note, that we are not going to test YOU or your abilities, there are no good or bad answers, we will rather look for information about the areas that might be improved in the Atlas app.

- [ ]  **Q: Have you uploaded any videos to Joystream?**
- Notes

Before you go - there might be a situation where you will see the Polkadot extension widget. Don’t worry, the data is already filled with our test account and you don’t need to fill out your information. You just need to click “Sign the transaction” :)

# TASKS

- [ ]  **Task 1: Imagine you are a new creator, you have posted some videos and I want you to go to the Payments page, play around with it and tell me what do you see, what do you think the pages are and what each section is about etc.**
- Notes

- [ ]  **Task 2 (new council payout appeared): I would like you to do the same thing you did in your first task. What do you think happened here? What changed?**
- [ ]  * Followup: How many tJOY do you have on your channel account now? (To see if they recognize that they have to claim it before it gets transferred to their account)
- Notes

- [ ]  **Task 3: Claim 700 000 tJOY from your payout and transfer it to your membership account**
- [ ]  * Followup question: What do you think happened here?
- [ ]  * Followup question: How much was the transaction fee? Where was it deducted from?
- Notes

- [ ]  **Task 4: If you were looking for more information on your payout, where would you look for it?**
- [ ]  * Followup (if they enter the Council payouts tab): What do you think each column means?
- Notes
