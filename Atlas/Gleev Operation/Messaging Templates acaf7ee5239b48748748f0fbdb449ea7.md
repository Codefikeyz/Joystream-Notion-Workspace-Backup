Hi,

Thank you for signing up to Gleev YPP.

After carefully checking your YT channel against the program requirements, unfortunately on this occasion your channel was not verified and suspended from the program participation. This means that your channel did not qualify for sign up rewards and automatic sync of content from YT to Gleev.

Likely that happened for one of the following reasons:

- Main topic is not Crypto / Web3 content
- Channel’s videos are featuring not original content, taken from other YT creators
- Channel has artificial subscribers and bot followers
- Channel has not been active over the last 6 months

Here is the list of the [full requirements to the program](../YouTube%20Partner%20Program%20Outline%20d492c2eb88ff4ace955b5f2902ec21fb.md).

The good news is that your channel remains on the Joystream network and is available on [https://l1.media](https://l1.media/) app, which supports all content categories and displays all videos. The YT partnership program and YT Sync service is unavailable for this application yet.

We are working on creating more applications that support your chosen content focus so please [join us on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/811216481848393740) to stay ahead of the news.

Thank you for your interest in Joystream and we are delighted to have you onboard.

Best,

dm
