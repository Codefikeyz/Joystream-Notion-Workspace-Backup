# JD for Recommendations Consultant

**Who are we?**

Joystream is a blockchain-based platform for video content distribution that empowers creators to earn rewards in the form of JOY tokens for their contributions to the network. By using blockchain technology, Joystream enables content creators to retain ownership of their content and maintain greater control over its distribution. Joystream aims to create a more equitable and decentralized ecosystem for video content distribution, where creators and their audiences can directly interact and benefit from their contributions.

The platform includes a suite of tools for managing and monetizing video content, including Gleev, a video streaming app for Web3/Crypto creators.

**What is the project about?**

User experience in Gleev App in most cases starts with the homepage, which represent a continuous feed of creators’ videos. Right now its driven by a simple algorythm, which ranks the content based on a formula that entails recency and engagement with an objective to mix up popular and new content. All users hitting the homepage now see the same version of the content, in the same order.

This approach was dictated by technical limitations that have been recently alleviated with the introduction of new capabilities on the server side. As a result of this work we are now ready to take our homepage feed to the next level via introducing elements of personalised smart content recommendation based on industry best practices, that would tailor the homepage feed for the individual viewers to maximise their engagement and time spent in the App discovering and watching videos. We are exploring a possibility of using a third party SAAS solution (Recommendation as a service).

**Engagement details**

This is a short-term part-time engagement and envision about 20 hours of work in total. We need someone to come in, look at our tech stack and work with our engineering team to help blueprint the approach to content personalisation and advise on technical implementation of third party tool integration. The project timeline can be extended with the candidates who have experience with our tech stack and willing to take on parts of the implementation.

**Who we are looking for?**

We are looking for an experienced engineer in the field of building or integrating with third party content personalisation and recommendation engines implementation to design the content personalisation system, based on the mix of content features and user-specific behavioural parameters.

**Minimum requirements:**

- Engineering background
- Experience in implementing content personalisation and recommendation engines
- Experience with building/ integrating with DWH solutions
- Experience with selecting market leading recommendation providers
- Practical familiarity with the concepts of building models with elements of:
1. Collaborative Filtering. Looking at patterns of user interactions such as video views, likes, shares, and subscriptions to understand user preferences and suggest similar content to those users.
2. Content-Based Filtering: Analysing video metadata, such as titles, descriptions, tags, and closed captions, to determine the relevance of videos to a user's interests based on the historical content consumption by this user.
3. Engagement and Feedback Signals: Incorporating engagement signals, including watch time, likes, dislikes, comments, and shares, to assess user satisfaction and determine the quality and relevance of videos and building the self-calibration mechanisms to the recommendation algorithms.
4. User History and Context: Taking into account factors such as the user's past behaviour, previously watched videos, language, geo location, and active subscriptions to tailor recommendations to individual preferences.
5. Diversity and Exploration: Incorporating exploration mechanisms introducing content with lower relevancy which is likely to be of interest based on broader patterns and user behavior.

**Desired:**

- Experience of working for an industry leading household name in content distribution (ideally video streaming app with large user base)
- Interest in Web3 industry
- Experience with ML/NN to train models that predict preferences and interests on the individual / user cohort basis
