# YPP 2.0 Release Post

# Intro

We have set up Joystream as an open source platform for video streaming services with a view to support innovation in the content production and consumption, which has been long dominated by incumbent closed corporate Web 2.0 platforms, such as YouTube. The overarching problem breakdown and our solution is covered with much detail in our [lightpaper](https://www.joystream.org/lightpaper.pdf).

Just to recoup, from the onset, our strategic view was always to attract developers who can quickly ramp up innovative services on top of the core Joystream video distribution platform, without the need to invest into the infrastructure layer and fully focus on their business model and building community. In order to further reduce the upfront costs for creating such video streaming services we’ve built Atlas, an open source video streaming App that works with the  Joystream platform “out of the box”.

While Atlas codebase is available for anyone to operate or build upon, JS Genesis, the founding company behind Joystream, made a decision to operate a single instance of Atlas, under its own brand - Gleev. Gleev was deliberately selected to act as a “showroom” of the broader platform capabilities as well as test the innovative aspects of Web 3.0 video streaming, and its exclusive features: 
- Public ledger of video content ownership, comments and reactions 
- Member accounts and channels linked to blockchain wallets
- Unique monetisation features: NFTs, creator channel tokens, channel tipping and member-only (gated) content. 

At launch of Gleev, JS Genesis team has deliberately chosen to focus on the single, specific niche - the Crypto creators in pursuit of the three major benefits
- Leaving the opportunity for the developers community to occupy other content verticals
- Benefit from the more targeted content focus, allowing to serve more relevant content for its users and build an engaged community around specific area of interest
- Reducing the onboarding and adoption friction for the new users who are being introduced to the Web 3.0 concepts

So Gleev was launched as a video streaming app for crypto creators and Web3 enthusiasts. 

# Launching YouTube Partner Program

In order to attract viewers a video streaming platform needs the content of course. And convincing creators to add their videos to the new platform is not a small undertaking. To minimise the barrier of adding new content to Gleev, our team has built a YouTube Sync service which helps to add new videos from existing YT channels without any additional effort. The service simply required to sign up with the Google account and grant access to readonly scopes of YT API. 

But nothing comes for free in this world, and creators, used to monetising their content on YT via advertising needed something else, and wanted it right away to be interested in signing up. So while our unique Web3 monetisation features are still in the development pipeline, we found a way to cover for the temporary gap in the creators’ value proposition and saturate our platform with content - that was with YouTube Partner Program. 

The YouTube Partner Program rewards *crypto* creators for signing up, referring other creators and syncing content from YouTube. This approach has quickly paid off and the number of channels signing up quickly grew from a handful per week to hundreds of new sign up daily! 

With that many sign ups, the range of content quality (as a proxy of effort invested into production) of different channels, reputation and the influence in the community varies quite substantially. We wanted to find a way to reflect this in the rewards scheme and to make it attractive for a wide range of creators, from professional teams to solo part-time creators, while keeping the program budgets reasonably managed for a sustainable longer term growth. Quite naturally, the program terms took the shape of the progressive scale of rewards based on the channel popularity, expressed in the number of subscribers on YouTube. 

This approach, while brings an understandable reward scale in theory, introduced a number of challenges and inefficiencies that tempered our growth. We were failing to compensate creators in-line with the added value their content brings to the Gleev users. Compensation *strictly* based on the YT subscribers and being on Crypto topic, does not provide the tools to prevent the program terms being exploited by channels with the “rigged” subscribers and views purchased from click- and bot farms, while at the same time we did not reward enough the recently created channels which despite the amazing content quality have not amassed the subscriber base. 

A better way to distinguish between channels *quality* had to be found to optimise the population of the platform with “great to watch” content at a reasonable cost and fuel the rapid growth without running out of gas too soon.

To get the YPP feature out of the door quickly, we reduced the scope of the project to absolute operational minimum hence leaving some of the nice-to-have features in the backlog. The program took off nicely, and creators really embraced it, sharing the feedback as they were signing up, referring their friends and syncing their content. 

A few improvements were identified as candidates for the upgraded release:

- Better explanation of the sync service integration access to YT channel’s data
- More focus on the platform vision upfront - explaining the Web3 unique monetization tools which are in the product and development pipeline
- Enhanced programmatic updates on the verification process and participation status
- More granularity on the syncing service queue, individually calculated for each channel

But the most frequent feedback was about the possibility to invite / subscribe the creators which are producing content outside of Crypto and Web3.

# Expanding Beyond Crypto

Despite the marketing and sales efforts been focussed solely on the Crypto community, the word of mouth, creators promo videos and referrals activity resulted in the vast numbers of new channels that signed up being from all paths of life, and not just crypto. 

A few months in we’ve accumulated a large user base of the non-crypto channels (in fact x5 larger than crypto community), willing to sign up and participate in the App. We were leaving these users suspended, and the list of accounts which would otherwise could contribute to the app growth was simply frozen in the list of suspended channels.

Gleev team has been consistently excluding non-crypto channels from the YPP rewards scheme and sync service, while staying consistent with our initial vision of leaving everything outside of Crypto space “for grabs” to the non JS Genesis teams to operate in, and there was one alternative.

Almost a year later after the launch of Gleev as solely crypto-focussed app we arrived to having an alternative, category-agnostic app launched by the Joystream DAO members - [l1.media](http://l1.media). The app operation for growth required more focus and effort than was available by the team operating it, which resulted in the auto-sync service along with some other updates was not on the cards for that app. The major fuel for growth of channels on l1.media were the Gleev-rejects. 

The gap in the experience started to get wider with time and at some point it became  apparent that l1.media app is falling short of demonstrating the traction sufficient to count it as a fully fledged occupant of the chosen content vertical, and Joystream DAO is too busy handling the infrastructure demand growth and internal processes to be able to effectively focus on managing a second app in the ecosystem. 

# Introducing YPP 2.0

We’ve launched Youtube Partner Program in early 2023 to lower the barriers of entry for the creators to publish their content to Gleev app. The service simply required to sign up with the Google account and get all the videos synced to Gleev for a reward. This approach has quickly paid off and the number of channels signing up quickly grew from a handful per week to hundreds of new sign up daily! 

While ironing out the operations we’ve also been carefully collecting the feedback from creators and identified a number of improvements for the YPP program and Gleev product which we are happy to announce in this post. 

Following a strategy review session and carefully considering the creators feedback, JS Genesis team is bring a new release of Gleev YPP programme spanning 

- Revised set of criteria and tiers for creator rewards
- Expanded category focus
- Improved YPP dashboard
- Refreshed landing page

## Broad c**ontent focus**

Arguably the biggest change in the YPP terms is opening up Gleev to a broad range of categories. Creators will be able to map their YT channels to one of the top level categories at the point of signing up. Categories discovery for the viewers, will only gradually appear, once the critical mass of content is reached in each of them.

More popular categories that we expect to appear sooner are marked in **bold** while the full set is presented below. 
****

| • Art
• Animation and Film
• Autos and Vehicles
• Business and Finance
• **Crypto** ⭐
• DIY
• Education
• Entertainment
• Lifestyle
• **Memes and Humour**
 | • **Music and Music Videos**
• Nature
• News and Current Affairs
• People and Blogs
• Pets and Animals
• Sports
• **Technology**
• Travel
• Unboxing
• **Video Games** |

## Quality first

****In the past we have been automatically assigning tiers to the verified channels, based on the subscriber count only. Subscriber count served as benchmark for channel popularity and quality, and we used it as proxy for the value that YT creators add to Gleev App by syncing their content. 

While it served us okay, the limitations in distributing the rewards based on “merit” were already covered above so we wanted a way to handle this better. We will now start rewarding channels based on the quality of content first, and only then consider popularity.  

We’ve arrived to the 3 paid tiers (silver-diamond) and 1 tier that is subsidised purely by providing the access to the distribution infrastructure and sync service (bronze). 

We believe this would allow us to be inclusive, but also not forced to reward nor to exclude the channels that are spending much less effort in creating their content, but do not violate any terms and simply have the right to exist. Below I am covering each of the tiers in more detail.

## Enhanced program participation experience

Based on the feedback from the channels and support interactions we’ve added more info to the YPP dashboard and happy to be presenting the updated version

![Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 14.55.26.png](../YPP%202%200%20Release%20Post/Screenshot_2023-09-27_at_14.55.26.png)

1️⃣ One of the core changes is that Dashboard will now be available to all channels on Gleev from the get go. Also, regardless of participation and verification status on YPP, everyone who has a channel can benefit from the referrals program!

![Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 15.14.46.png](../YPP%202%200%20Release%20Post/Screenshot_2023-09-27_at_15.14.46.png)

2️⃣ The verification status and assigned tier will now be taking a prominent place in the top widgets row. In case of suspended channels the reason will be displayed right in the dashboard. 

It would be also easier to sign up from the dashboard for mobile users by clicking the “sign up to participate” button right in the widget.

3️⃣ Ypp Sync Service status is improved with displaying the precise position in the syncing queue, counter of videos queued up as well as the ETA to full sync.

4️⃣ Payment widget will feature the next payment date and link to the page with historical statistics.

## **Accents on the core in the early onboarding**

****Web3.0 unique content monetisation and community collaboration features is what puts us apart from the industry incumbents. One of points that our product team attempted to achieve with the refreshed onboarding experience is to equip the channels who are signing up with a better understanding of what we are all about, and the features they can expect for the channel monetisation.  

The features are: 

- Creator Tokens - due for MVP release before the New Year. A huge milestone for our project and an incredibly powerful tool to fundraise and get consistent revenue for your channel shared with your fans and audience.

- Tipping - due early next year. A nice and useful feature for someone who is seeking for a quick thank you, without getting into the weeds of joining a more involved option of creator tokens. Something that is quickly becoming an industry standard.

- Members only (gated) content - due mid-next year. The last element to the full set of content monetization we are bringing to our creators. This feature is in the early concept stage and will deserve its own blogpost when designs are cooked and ready.

![Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 19.21.24.png](../YPP%202%200%20Release%20Post/Screenshot_2023-09-21_at_19.21.24.png)

Gleev App is verified by Google Auth and YouTube teams, and this process took months of scrutinising of our API and product design to get obtained! This status wasn’t communicated well enough in the earlier version, so following the feedback from the creators who signed up not without pinch of hesitation we decided to expand on this topic right on the sign up page. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 19.21.01.png](../YPP%202%200%20Release%20Post/Screenshot_2023-09-21_at_19.21.01.png)

****Last but not the least, with the landing page we wanted to make a lasting first impression with strong bold typography and an easy way to start the sign up journey right off the bat.  We’ve taken the opportunity to bring it closer with [Joystream.org](http://Joystream.org) website to make the transition smoother for the organic traffic.

# The Future Looks Bright

The release have been shipped on the 29th of September, paving the way for the Gleev App and its community to steadily grow in the direction we are moving - the empowered creators, in full ownership of their content, monetising it in the ways that work for their best interest while serving it in the best interest of their audience.

It will now take some time to process the already suspended channels and re-introduce them to the updated experience and we are planning to do this in stages, a fraction of the channels over the span of several weeks. 

We will continue to listen to the voice of creators while improving the platform and of course there are more features that need to get added to Gleev for the viewers benefit. For their delight we have a packed roadmap full of major improvements like adaptive streaming, playlists, enhanced recommendation engine, which we are well aware of and already have a solid plan of introducing them as part of our growth and product improvement roadmap!
