# Creator Acquisition

Up until now, we have been only using a single channel for marketing - cold emails.
 
The list of contacts we have prepared using creators search SAAS with “Crypto” label. It is now exported to csv and stored on [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o81c_6vpvGgHMsVOjSCXhAEySfC2Mx2m1IooKSn6DpA/edit#gid=1355450430). I take the list with emails, lice by the number of subscribers on YT into separate segments: 0-1500, 1500-5k, 5k-10k, 10-20k followers. 

We use [Sendgrid Single Sends](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends?view=raw) for emails distribution. 

Copy was prepared together with Chat GPT, based on feeding it our Lightpaper and marketing website. Emails outline [can be found here>](Creator%20Acquisition/Email%20Campaigns%20Copy%20and%20Campaign%20outline%20ba4d8de302af4c718b58ca8880ad62f3.md) 

Everyone who rececived at least one email I enter to Hubspot as Leads. So far we have sent at least 1 email to 2741 records. I keep track of who got which one by populating the UTM field, as well as “Step”. The contacts list is split into different views, based on their step in the cadence (number of emails received).

We tried to use Tolstoy App for creating videos and embedding gifs to emails which did not prove to bring drastically different results. Here’s the link to [the tool>](https://www.notion.so/https-coinmarketcap-com-community-profile-JoystreamDAO-4f4850c8f0cb4cacb246ae64ab2ad44f?pvs=21) 

0-10k have already received 4 emails, from the calendar.
10-20k ony received one email so far, pls [see here>](Creator%20Acquisition/Single%20Send%20Stats%20wc%2015th%20521539dfc893430d834bec107f180551.md) 

In general Open Rate is more then 50% for the first email sent, with 10% shaved off each subsequent follow up.  Highest click rate was at 6.5% during the last campaign (not added to the table below, but the results are [covered here>](Creator%20Acquisition/Single%20Send%20Stats%20wc%2015th%20521539dfc893430d834bec107f180551.md)
