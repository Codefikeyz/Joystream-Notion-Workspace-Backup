# Single Send Stats wc 15th

**Campaign 1**

****Hypothesis:  step 4 in the cadence, with focus on the monetization aspects of the platform and adding creators who already signed up as image.
AB test: subject line
Result: 0 signups; no replies.
Learning: by this time after 5 emails everyone who wanted to sign up from the recipients must have read the email and seen the website. 2-3 email cadence is smth I believe we should aim on for converting.
