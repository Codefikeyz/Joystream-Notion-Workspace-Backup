## **11 May

Campaign 1**

[SendGrid](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/36fd555a-f008-11ed-b88f-42ac8b3db0b8/stats?view=raw)

**Comment**: Audience of this campaign had already received 2 emails before. 1 intro message which was a bit lengthy and had too many URLs embedded. Second email to this group had a light paper follow up and summary of value proposition, which had a decent open rate, but still very few clicks through to the YPP landing page. 

This email introduced USDT cash bonus for the first time and had video of Bedeho embedded above the fold line on mobile. 

**Hypothesis we tried to test:** 
1. Does USDT in subject line impact open rate
2. Does USDT promise tip people over to sign up
3. Will follow up emails (step2 and 3) have higher click through rates
4. Do people click on the video

**Results:**

1. Impact on Open rate - no, unique opens were all at the same mark for each header, with and without USDT.
2. Likely so
3.  Higher click through rates for follow ups - maybe   (one recipe F had 4 unique clicks out of 51 opens, which is 7.8%)
4. 8 clicks on video out of 12 unique clicks out of 270 unique opens

### **Campaign 2**

[SendGrid](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/4b5ce6f3-f015-11ed-af08-5ab0ea4a8319/stats?view=raw)

**Comment**: Audience of this campaign first had USDT  bonus message with embedded video of brief YPP benefits walkthrough by Bedeho served  in Tolstoy app. 

This single send has value prop summary and light paper attached. Here we also split tested USDT in subj line vs non-monetary focus. Pls note the winning variation for OPEN rates of the subj has nothing on money. (However, the ones that signed up this week were all after USDTs)

**Hypothesis we tried to test:** 
1. Will value prop trigger more genuine interest vs USDT cash bonus
2. Will follow up emails at step 3 have higher click through rates
3. Do people click on the video?

**Results:**

1. No, value prop did not tip over
2. No, follow email had decent open rate (again around 40%) but not much more unique clicks

**Campaign details:**
SS name: sent to ones who seen light paper and vp - embedded vid and USDT in sub
Step count: 2
Target Audience: sent to ones who had the firs email with USDT promise, now was more focussed on value prop and gave link to lightpaper

## Summary

The levers of bringing interested people in are unclear at this point of time. Mixed approaches seem to work. Best performing campaign (campaign 2 above): USDT, followed up by Value proposition, resulting in 3 new subscribers from single campaign.
