**Joystream Platform Description**

Joystream is a blockchain-based platform for video content distribution that empowers creators to earn rewards in the form of JOY tokens for their contributions to the network. By using blockchain technology, Joystream enables content creators to retain ownership of their content and maintain greater control over its distribution. 

The platform includes a suite of tools for managing and monetizing video content, including Gleev, an app for Web3/Crypto creators that automatically syncs YouTube content to the Joystream network. Joystream aims to create a more equitable and decentralized ecosystem for video content distribution, where creators and their audiences can directly interact and benefit from their contributions.

**Key Benefits for Creators**

1. Monetization opportunities with JOY tokens: Creators can earn tokens for their contributions to the network, generating additional revenue streams and potentially increasing overall earnings. 
- YouTube partnership program is paid by Gleev Operating Company. Each Web3 content creator signing up with their YT channel qualifies for sign up bonus of up to 100 USD, up to 15 USD for each new vide synced after sign up, and 50 USD per referral of YT channels with substantial subscriber base. 
- Joystream DAO council itself rewards creators for quality from a dedicated tokens pool. This is totally independent from YT and all channels who post quality content to Joystream network have potential to be rewarded. 
-  Channels can Mint NFTs from your videos, and earn from marketplace, auction sales and royalties.
- Channels will be soon capable of mint own creator tokens and sell them on the automatic market maker and private sales. Our product and dev team is currently working on releasing this feature.

2. Increased engagement and community building: Creators can connect with audiences in new ways through decentralized communities and rewards systems (features are in the pipe: creator tokens, gated content), building stronger relationships and increasing engagement around their content.
3. Ownership and control of content: Creators retain full control and ownership of their content, and the ownership is recorded on Blockchain.
