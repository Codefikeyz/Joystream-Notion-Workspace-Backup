# YPP 2.0 - updated categories and Tiers

This is the page that is aimed on internal guidelines for allocating the channels who sign up to YPP after the release 2.0 is out. 

**CATEGORIES**

As part of this release we will be opening up Gleev for channels from all categories, and not just crypto. This is the full list of categories that Gleev will support. All current categories supported by Gleev will be merged to a single CRYPTO category. 

More frequent categories that we expect are marked in **bold.**

- Art
- **Animation and Film**
- Autos and Vehicles
- Business and Finance
- **Crypto**
- DIY
- Education
- **Entertainment**
- Lifestyle
- Memes and Humour
- Music and Music Videos
- Nature
- News and Current Affairs
- People and Blogs
- Pets and Animals
- Sports
- **Technology**
- Travel
- Unboxing
- **Video Games**

**TIERS**

****In the past we have been automatically assigning tiers to the verified channels, based on the subscriber count only. Subscriber count served as benchmark for channel popularity and quality, and we used it to derive the value that such channels add to Gleev platform. 

While it served us well in distributing the rewards based on “merit”, it has a serious shortcoming and does not compensate all channels fairly

- Channels who purchase bots and have fake subscribers / views/ comments from “click farms” resulting in channels with bad content to get allocated to high tiers and get paid
- Channels with great quality but who are new and have not gained enough subscribers just yet and only growing
****

<aside>
💡 So we want to start rewarding channels based on the quality of content. Of course higher quality channels are more popular and get more views and subscribers. But sometimes it is not the case, so we have to focus on quality first, when we assign channels to the new Tiers.

**Genuine channels metrics look like this:**
Average video views in 1 month is about 10-30 % of subscribers count
1 to 3 comments per 1k views in the video
Channel posts at least once in 2-4 weeks

So if channel has 100k subscribers, they will have 10-30k views under each video, they will have more than 100 comments under each video.

**Diamond** 
Q: Absolute gold standard of quality. Professionally done. Branded video thumbnails. Branded intro. Nice video editing, transition with special effects. Great quality of sound. Background music for reviews. Effort put in professional editing of video.  They will show themselves presenting content on full screen and mix it with product sharing.
S: Recognised influencer status. Very large subscriber audience, likely 50k+. For 500k and above that is definitely the case!
V: Average views per video ~ more than 10k per video
R: Total ratio of such channels from all channels who signup not more than 2% or less

**Gold** 
Q: Popular, good quality, well done, interesting to watch even if not interested in the narrow topic that channel covers. 
S: Subscribers likely to be > 10-50k
V: Average views per video ~  More than 2k per video less than 10k
R: Total ratio of such channels from all channels who signup not more than 8% or less

**Silver**
Q: OK quality, interesting to watch **only** if interested in the narrow topic and can compromise on quality for the content.  No branding, likely to not show themselves during video reviews.  Sound may not be that great either. 
S: Subscribers likely to be > 1-10k
V: Average view per video ~ around 500-2k per video
R: Total ratio of such channels from all channels who signup not more than 20%

**Bronze** 

Q: Amateur quality, followed by friends or only purchased subscribers.  These are the channels we don’t want to pay for at all but do not want to block from our platform either. It is all that “homevideo content that adds little value to our platform but may still be okay for some selected viewers”

S: Follower base likely to be <1k. 

V: Average view per video ~ less than 500 per video
R: Total ratio of such channels form all channels who sign up is about 70% or more

**BRIEF**

1. VERIFIED CHANNELS

Re-rank all crypto channels that we have signed up with the updated Tiers above in this spreadsheet

As you can see in the screenshot above I have already started populating the list. 👆 Independent of how many subscribers they have some of the channels are marked as Gold and Silver, even though they have more than 150k subscribers. 

In some cases it is hard to decide as the judgement is subjective. For such cases please add the second thought as text to the Second thought column and I will review. 

👆 Also, please don’t forget to update teh ownership of the records

2. SUSPENDED CHANNELS

Rank all suspended channels to the Tier **AND assign a category to them from the list**. Same mechanics applies as above, but I have added category selector to the spreadsheet.   

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0XDZwsN7zAlTOyy4evTPI6TWZbjxx7Jhjlhow5vYlM/edit#gid=197705379](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0XDZwsN7zAlTOyy4evTPI6TWZbjxx7Jhjlhow5vYlM/edit#gid=197705379)

I have highlighted the most popular categories and moved them to the top of the drop down list. For some channels it will not be clear which one (I assume, so I have created second list of maybe category if in doubt).
