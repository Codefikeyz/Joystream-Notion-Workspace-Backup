# Product and Ops Tools

# Hubspot

## Intro

Hubspot is used as a main CRM tool for the creators on Gleev

It was originally put in place to direct acquisition efforts, however currently is mainly used as a repository of all existing YPP customers - YT channels, signed up to Gleev via YPP flow.

On a high level Hubspot keeps the data base. of the contacts, that can be added to it 

- manually
- via csv export
- via API

Contacts properties can be updated via same mechanisms.  

## Unique identifier

The main identifier of the contact is email. It has to be unique!

⚠️ At present YPP Backend does not have the validation for email to be unique per channel and it is possible to register multiple channels with the same email. That leads to a risk of fraction of the channels missing payments for their second channels. And such cases need to be handled manually. 

There’s an issue in the backlog that addresses the validation

[https://github.com/Joystream/youtube-synch/issues/276](https://github.com/Joystream/youtube-synch/issues/276)

Payment operations should be moved to YPP Dynamo entirely and not depend on Hubspot for calculations. Only status update could be stored in Hubspot after the payouts completed. 

## Integrations

Hubspot is integrated with YPP backend app. It creates new records about signed up channels (customers) and referrers, who did not sign up just yet (lead status = referrer). 

YPP backend app also updates records of existing customers, when YPP-status have been updated or referrer turns into customer (signs up to YPP). 

Updates are managed via cron job.

There are different combination of filters pre-saved as views, organised in separate tabs

![Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 14.05.50.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-26_at_14.05.50.png)

Contacts are comprised of largely 3 groups:

**1. Leads**

Originally imported database of leads for acquisition
`Lifecycle stage`  =
`lead`, meaning such channel did not convert to YPP customer yet, roughly 9k records of customers who haven’t signed up yet. Pi

`Lead status` =
 
`New` - newly imported lead, no actions taken wrt to such lead
`Attempted to contact` - contacted at least once via email or social media. Originally used by JSG marketing outreach team (Dima)
`bad timing` - unsubscribed from email reach out (added to global unsub list) or asked not to contact via sm
`contacted by kiwi` - contacted at least once via email or social media. Originally used by Kiwi marketing outreach team (Richard)

`connected` - converted to YPP customer (signed up). This value is used together with the updated value for Lifecycle stage (to `customer`, see below)

1. **Customers**

Channels that signed up to YPP get created via API with the following values:
`Lifecycle stage` = Customer
`Lead status` = Connected

1. **Referrers**

Channels that shared the referral link from YPP dashboard, which resulted in signups and referral rewards were attributed to such channels get created via API with the following values

`Lifecycle stage` = Customer
`Lead status` = Referrer

## Contacts Fields Explanation

In terms of Hubspot objects **all of the following fields** are created as `contact information` group of attributes

### General

`Name` - unique identifier of the channel. Currently populated with email. 
`lifecycle stage` - `lead` not registered on Gleev,  or `customer` - registered on Gleev
`lead status` - covered in the section above, various steps in the acquisition funnel, with `connected` meaning signed up to YPP and `referrer` meaning successfully referred at least one channel
`Channel title` - Title of channel in YouTube. 
`Channel URL` - url snippet of the channel in YouTube. It has channel Id encoded into it. `channel/UCmEmGj-LAD5rKxULnNqDzuQ`. To get to channel page on YT one would need to go `youtube.com/channel/id`
****`Subscribers YT` - subscriber count in YT
`email` - email

### Marketing related

`Latest action comment`- used for commenting of acquisition efforts
 e.g. Ready to promote our content or Said interested but did not sign up yet
`Week contacted by Kiwi` - used to split the work in phases and organise reachout in “waves”  or “funnel steps”
`UTM code`- utm code used in the first reachout attempt. Used to calculate campaign efficiency. This snippet can be filtered by in the analytics tools like amplitude (calculate hits to the page with particular utm code for urls such as  `gleev.xyz/ypp/utm_source=xyz&utm_campaign=xyz`
`UTM2, UTM3..` - utm codes used in subsequent email campaigns
`Last email step` - used to track how many times channel was contacted via email already. Used in crafting correct messaging
`bounced` - email bounced, no such email exists 
`unsubscribed` - customer unsubscribed using unsub link or asked not to send him further comms
`twitter_username_url` - twitter acc link
`telegram_name_url` - telegram acc link
`discord_name_url` - discord acc link

### YPP Operations related

### Updated by records update cron

`gleev channel id` - channel id in gleev

`Date signed up to YPP` - date time stamp signed up, taken from YPP dynamo table, displays in the timezone configured by user
`Sync category name` - title of the category chosen for sync by the user during sign up process
`videocategoryid` - on-chain id of the category used for sync
`yppstatus`- example value `Verified:Bronze`, or `Suspended:ProgramTermsExploit`, can be also `OptedOut` when channel opts out from sync and rewards using UI in YPP Dashboard
`referredby` - id of channel who referred a given channel. If channel did not indicate referred during sign up, this value will be empty
`VideosCount` - total number of videos in the YT channel at the time of sign up.  ⚠️? tbc if updated by cron or remains static. 

### Updated by payout calculation script

`LatestDateChecked` - timestamp of channel upload and referral rewards statistics calculation. Used to attribute rewards, for example sign up rewards will not be added to channel which has this field already populated. Also used for sync rewards cap calculation and referral rewards cutoff.  Updated by rewards calculation script. 
`New synced vids` - used to calculate new synced videos from the latest date checked till the next execution of calculations script.
`videos synced rewards in USD` - reward for synced videos based on the config of YPP backend. 

At the time of writing:

- min duration of rewarded videos = 5 miuntes
- max rewarded videos per week = 3
- rewards per video per tier: 1,3,5 for silver, gold and diamond

`Sign up rewards in USD` - reward for sign up in accordance to channel tier. 
`Latest referral reward in USD` - referral rewards for the latest period (between calculation scripts)

### Updated by payout execution script

`Latest YPP reward status` - [to pay, paid, —] default value is set to —, then after calculation script is run it is set to `to-pay`, after payout script is run it is set to `paid`

`Latest overall ypp reward in JOY` - sum of rewards paid to channel reward address. Updated by calculation script. Takes into account  JOY/ USDT exchange rate provided by operator using the script. 
`total ypp rewards in JOY` - cumulative total rewards paid to channel historically.

## Managing contacts manually

To bulk update multiple channels, here’s what needs to be done

1. click on Advanced filters

1. Filter contacts using contact attributes (e.g. date range signed up to YPP)
2. Click select page
3. Click “select all” - next to the counter of channels
4. Click edit (and continue the flow)

![Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 14.11.03.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-26_at_14.11.03.png)

Contacts can also be updated via CSV import

## Billing

Martin is the account owner.

JSG is on the starter pack, with default marketing and operation hubs enabled. 

Currently the basis for billing is mainly comprised of the **marketing contacts count.** Marketing contacts is the property that is required to be assigned to contacts to be able to contact them directly from the platform (via Email).

****👉🏻 Hubspot is configured now to include all added contacts from YPP BE as marketing contacts**.

As of end of November, the monthly payment is at 170 EUR, and every 1k contacts added increases the price by 40 EUR per month.**

# Segment

## Intro

Segment is a tool to connect various platforms in the org system landscape, focussed around user and provide a seamless data flow between them. It can enables single customer view and trigger marketing campaigns based on user behaviour. 

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 17.34.58.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_17.34.58.png)

Use cases: 
1. Get user data from Gleev app and send events to Amplitude analytics tool for product team to review. 
2. Get user data from Gleev app and send events to Google analytics to pair it up with marketing analytics for the benefit of marketing team.
3. Get server side events data and push to Hubspot for appending user records e.g. NFT minted
4. Get server side events and push to misc marketing tools - e.g. Twitter retargeting for CRTs

## Usage at JSG

We installed segment to enable connection between website, analytics and marketing platforms, but essentially using it to connect Atlas with Amplitude (Analytics platform).  So we are really using only “Connections” product. 

Production and Dev connections (for testing) are done separately

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 17.29.13.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_17.29.13.png)

### Events Tracked

Events tracked are split into 3 types

- Page events -  sent when user hits a page
- Track events - custom set up, this can be anything from form submission, change of filters or carousel scroll on marketplace or clicking on a particular component
- Identify events  - events that are sent to identify user (when they create account or sign in)

<aside>
💡 All new events need to be specifically requested to be added so that they can be sent to Amplitude for analysis (downstream). E.g. when we built referrals page, hits to referrals page had to be added separately.

</aside>

### Link to Schema

Full list of events tracked with statistics can be found on the schema page

[Segment](https://app.segment.com/jsgenesis/sources/gleev/schema/events)

Preview of events:

Events also have attributes, which can be viewed by expanding the events on the schema page like so:

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 17.57.50.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_17.57.50.png)

### Problems still lingering

**1. Events ordering**

Some events arrive to Amplitude in the order, different to what they were performed in. JS snippet implanted to Gleev website collects events and sends them to Segment. Segment automatically assigns timestamps to them. In some occasions the order of the events does not match the real order done by customer. This impacts the analytics down the line, and some of the % drop off in the YPP onboarding funnel occurs due to this issue. 

**2. Events omitting**

Some events have multiple properties, and when the page is accessed very quickly (e.g. opened and closed right away) the event may not fire. As it takes some time to load and assemble properties in fulll, there’s a small delay set on firing the events. The impact is rather insignificant. 

**3. Cookies limitation**

Segment only tracks the events for users who opted in to all cookies tracking. So subset of user events are not tracked at all. In order to minimise this, it is advisable to move from “accept all / reject all” to “Accept all / more details”. Where individual non essential cookies can be disabled separately. There are 3rd party solutions (SAAS) that allow to do it fairly easily. There’s a placeholder issue created to take care of it.

## Features overview from account manager email

From: [iosman@twilio.com](mailto:Issa%20Yusuf%20Osman%20%3Ciosman%40twilio.com%3E)

Hey Dmitry

Thanks for taking the time to speak with us . It was great to get introduced and learn a bit more about the current CDP initiative you have running with Jsgenesis. Including an overview below of Segment below for your reference.

**Segment overview**

Segment helps you simplify event collection via a single API that can be configured to any of your digital sources of data (website, mobile apps, in-store, server, cloud apps etc). Once you configure Segment onto your platform, we can start collecting information on a user [(who / what / where)](https://sales.segment.com/api/mailings/click/PMRHK4TMEI5CE2DUORYHGORPF5ZWKZ3NMVXHILTDN5WS6ZDPMNZS6Y3PNZXGKY3UNFXW44ZPONYGKYZPEIWCE2LEEI5CEMZZGMYDINZXEIWCE33SM4RDUIRYMYZDGNRVMQ2S2MBUMJQS2MJRMU3C2OJUGBQS2MBSMM4WCNRYG5RTGM3CEIWCE5TFOJZWS33OEI5CENBCFQRHG2LHEI5CEZ2QGE4VAR3JOUYDIZBRNRFXURLYMF5GU3C2JBZWI4KSLA4XKOBWLFVXEM2SKVETONZXM46SE7I=) by instrumenting the different events that you want to be tracking. This can be configured to be sent to any downstream tools for activation on a real time basis. Effectively decoupling data collection from data activation, will help alleviate any issues around data silos and inconsistent data sitting across different tools, as Segment would collect all user data, consolidate within our platform, clean it and send it to any tool (including data warehouse) that it requires, in real time.

# Amplitude

## Intro

Amplitude is best in class product analytics tool. It provides comprehensive insight into the actions that users take on Gleev.

Here’s the link to our instance: 

[](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/analytics/jsgenesis/home)

### Schema

Amplitude is set up as destination tool in Segment, and works on the basis of events collected via segment.js implanted to Gleev. 

The full schema of events can be reviewed here: 

[](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/data/jsgenesis/Jsgenesis/events/main/latest?view=All)

Events have properties (same as in Segment) and full list of event properties can be reviewed here:

[](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/data/jsgenesis/Jsgenesis/properties/main/latest/event)

⚠️ in Amplitude it is possible to assign properties not just to events, but to users directly. Example: user mints NFT, we can append user with “Minted NFT” property and then analyse users % based on such property.  It can take a more sophisticated approach, e.g. user sold >1mln JOYs worth of NFTs and we assign “high_roller” attribute to such user. This would require server side integration of Segment or Amplitude SDK directly. 

### Sources and Destinations for Data

Data to Amplitude comes from configurable sources. In our case it comes from Segment. 

It is possible to set up Destinations for data as well. E.g. user event can be appending user record in Hubspot. 

We do not have anything set up at the moment for that use case.

## Reports

### Dashboards

Dashboards and charts on Amplitude are organised in spaces. 
Gleev space can be found here:

[](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/analytics/jsgenesis/space/e-c34sagh6/all)

It has 3 dashboards pinned:

### Custom Reports

Custom reports can be created for any event tracked, filtered out, and grouped; compared to previous periods and measured based on totals/ frequency or properties count. 

1. Click Create on homepage

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.08.01.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.08.01.png)

2. Choose the type of analysis (chart or event)

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.12.00.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.12.00.png)

1. Choose the chart you are after (can be changed later)

    
    ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.08.27.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.08.27.png)
    
    4. Build the chart based on the event you are after
    
    In the example below I am generating line chart over last 7 days of `Referral link copied` event, grouped by language (browser). 
    
    Key areas to experiment with are highlighted in Green.
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.10.01.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.10.01.png)
    

For the funnel, multiple events can be organised in a sequence.

### User Lookup

[](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/analytics/jsgenesis/activity)

Amplitude allows to view all events by all users in a live feed

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.16.15.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.16.15.png)

Guest users vs Signed up users

Anonymous (guest) users are displayed with user Id, while signed up users have email as their unique identifier. Once anonymous user signs up, all his sessions will be conjoined in the individual sessions view ([see below](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools%2011c391579e7540c684d0b07c85a11140.md))

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.17.59.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.17.59.png)

Users can be also found based on various properties (such as IP address for instance)

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.16.07.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.16.07.png)

Clicking on individual user would open events stream for such user across sections

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.19.56.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.19.56.png)

# Livesession

### Getting session link from Amplitude

🏅 Super handy feature! For bugs triaging especially. 

Each user who accepts cookies is tracked via livesession. It is possible to find the link to the right session recording from user attributes. 

Go to user look up and click / search for users ([see more details above](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools%2011c391579e7540c684d0b07c85a11140.md)) 

In the feed of events find `livesession recording` event, and click on it

NB: Example below is for a different event, because we ran out of livesession allowance at the time of writing, but it illustrates the concept

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.25.00.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.25.00.png)

On the right handside in the event properties there will be `livesession id`
Click on it with right mouse button, then choose inspect, and copy it from source code (as the ID is too long to be displayed in the Amplitude app correctly)

Then paste it to the browser to watch the right session via livesession web console.

### Tool overview

Livesession is a tool for reviewing user sessions. It takes the feed of hmtl/ css and reconstructs the sessions in its built in browser. 

It has limited functionality of Sessions dashboard

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.47.34.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.47.34.png)

And extensive set of filters to slice and dice the recorded sessions

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.47.47.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.47.47.png)

![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 19.48.20.png](Product%20and%20Ops%20Tools/Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_19.48.20.png)

### Nice to have implementations

1. Currently multiple sessions by the same user are NOT combined under the same user, this requires additional implementation
Heres the link to how-to page
2. Currently custom user events or property events (events in general) are not sent to livesession. It is not supported by Segment out of the box and requires additional custom instrumentation

Link to relevant documentation:

[How to identify users and add custom properties?](https://livesession.io/help/user-identification-custom-properties/)

### Shortcomings

1. Dashboard does not have ability to get filtered by session properties. This functionality is in the pipeline for over than 1 year

1. Not all sessions seem to be recorded, sometimes livesession does not trigger for sessions that accept cookies. I suspect that is due to segment implementation specifics.
