# EXPERIENCE

: A researcher, developer and since recently may call myself entrepreneur to establish https://l1.media/
 as liberty preserving content platform.
As teen I started programming with Perl and use Debian since more than 20 years, spent lots of time compiling and testing software, worked with different Mediawiki instances to compile information publicly (nomadwiki.org, hitchwiki.org and others). Programmed web pages and developed with React since years and keep always learning new technologies. Including Joystream and now content  marketing.
