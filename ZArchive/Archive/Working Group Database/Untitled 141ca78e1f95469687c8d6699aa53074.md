| Apps | **Apps WG Lead** | DAO Infrastructure
Research of JSG's current infrastructure (QN + RPC nodes)--what do these cost, what hardware do they run on, how is load balancing set up, how many queries per day do they get?
Provisioning DAO-operated infrastructure that is a backup for the above. This could either be hiring a responsible person from within our current community or reaching out to a service provider to do the same. Anyone providing these services should be in a staked + paid role in the DAO and it is preferable that they get paid via a regular working group salary.
Monitoring and reporting of uptime and services provided in this area
Although these services would primarily be a "backup" it would be good to move Pioneer to using the DAO managed QN at some point in the near future. | [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/openings/apps-10](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/openings/apps-10) | 1 | Hired 1 worker and closed | **klaudiusz** |
