Description: The team consists of 4 people. Of these, 2 operators. 2 more work with the community and content. We are not yet a big validator, but we are gradually working on expanding it. Finding operators in different time zones (5 hours) allows you to respond to potential problems in time. When it comes to contributions, we focus on content. For monitoring, we use grafana and alerts in TG.

What is it critical for you to learn about in making a decision about becoming a validator in a new network?: Perhaps the most important things are:
-You must like the project and you must believe in it. Because the validator is not only passive technical actions in the form of maintaining the server and ensuring network security. And when you enjoy a project, you enjoy making time for it.

-Know that the validator will have stake support from the community or project. This is important when infrastructure costs pay off.

-Team of people who work on the project. It may sound strange... But we prefer to work with good people.
