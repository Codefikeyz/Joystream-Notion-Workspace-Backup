Description: I am an independent validator and node runner. I participated in many testnets and mainnets on Cosmos, Polkadot and others Pos/PoW networks. I previously worked as a backend developer for over 5 years (Python/JavaScript/C/C++) and am an experienced Linux user. For my nodes I use dedicated servers on Hetzner, Contabo, Ovhcloud and provide 24/7 management and monitoring!
