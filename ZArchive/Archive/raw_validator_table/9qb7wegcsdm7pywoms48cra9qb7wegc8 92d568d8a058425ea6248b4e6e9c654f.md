Description: I have great experience in keeping IT infrastructure! I am a DevOps engineer since I'm working in the IT industry I have a great experience with server configuration, monitoring systems, load balancing, failover clusters, IT automation tools (puppet, ansible), etc

I am going to do my best to get 100% uptime for my node because I understand how this important is for the proper work of the Network.

What is it critical for you to learn about in making a decision about becoming a validator in a new network?: I know from my own experience how important to be involved in a project and know all aspects of it. I have joined Joystream on March 2021, so I know many things about this project and how serious the team is about fulfilling their responsibilities so I know what is required of me.
