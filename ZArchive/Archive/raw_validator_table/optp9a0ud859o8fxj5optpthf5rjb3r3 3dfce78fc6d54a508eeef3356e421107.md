Description: Howdy, I'm Alex, aka doxe experienced web3 enthusiast, contributor, moderator and PoS/PoW validator, also just a friendly person.

In general, my main goal and vision is to help newbies and make their acquaintance with the world of crypto and tesnets in general easier, for this purpose I support guides for different projects in which I am involved or at people's request. At this stage, I write them in English, as I consider this language the most important one for understanding in web3. Also, I support Ukrainian, as it's my native language, and I understand Russian at the advance level. I often initiate the creation of thematic chats in telegram or other social networks to support people in the local language. There, together with other participants, I try to maintain interesting communication and help each other in case of any questions, issues and etc.

All in all, I've been doing this for about 1 year, and am very happy and favourable about it. I keep a close eye on each of my validators and responsibly monitor their health, security, updates and other parameters to ensure that they function consistently and correctly on the server.
