Description: Currently, I am not a validator, but I have a lot of experience participating in various testnets, however, I have a great desire to become part of the mainnet of the Joystream project! I am a very responsible person and really understand how important the role of a failsafe of my server, security, and monitoring. I will be very grateful if you consider my candidacy

What is it critical for you to learn about in making a decision about becoming a validator in a new network?: I believe really important to be involved in a project and know how it works. Since I have been with the project since March 2021, I am very aware of the requirements of the team and how serious you are about all aspects of the project, so I am very serious about all the tasks that you set for its participants
