Description: We've been investing to improve the validating quality and our capabilities to contribute to ecosystem. B-Harvest members are core developers of Cosmos SDK, but not dedicated to validator operations. So we have fully-dedicated engineers who have expertise on cloud architecture and SW engineering, and in the process of hiring a developer for validator related code/tooling contributions. After complete the dedicated workforce setup we expect we do proactive contributions to the ecosystem by leveraging our core SDK developers' expertise.
