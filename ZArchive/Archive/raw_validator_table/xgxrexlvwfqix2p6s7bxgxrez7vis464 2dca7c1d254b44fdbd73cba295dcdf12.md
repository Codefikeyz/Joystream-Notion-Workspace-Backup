What is it critical for you to learn about in making a decision about becoming a validator in a new network?: That the project really brings something unique that defines its own identity, that cannot be copied or imitated and that generates value for its community, making it something that people want to use. Tokenomics are a secondary step since, once interest of the community is there, the rest goes on rails.
