Description: I've ran mainnet and testnet validators in a lot of projects in the past, among them are Canto, Teritori, Stride, SSV, Celestia, Near, etc... I have a good knowledge of Bash and Python.
I'm always looking for new opportunities and ways to enrich my experience that's why I'm highly interested in your suggestion.
