Description: OptimusValidatorNetwork was born at the beginning of 2021, when we started digging into the Crypto world and started to use our background and skills to support new projects. Since then we have supported over 20 projects. Now we have ~20 servers between instances and dedicated. Each of our mainnet node has a backup node and automated scripting to launch it if a fault in the main node is detected. We continuously improve automation and monitoring.
With your help we can strive to go green and offset our energy use!

What is it critical for you to learn about in making a decision about becoming a validator in a new network?: I mostly look at: Idea behind it, partnerships and team.
I join the testnet and help the team through the path for the mainnet.
In this way i am able to observe and learn how trustworthy they are.
Also rewards and value of the project are very important.

My infrastructure has auto monitoring and alarming going straight to the smartphones of our members so we are able to react fast.
We also have backup nodes for the critical mainnets (so the one that provide us good income).
We are based in Europe so there might be a delay over night. We can expand with other member in other timezones if needed. In 2y it was not needed
