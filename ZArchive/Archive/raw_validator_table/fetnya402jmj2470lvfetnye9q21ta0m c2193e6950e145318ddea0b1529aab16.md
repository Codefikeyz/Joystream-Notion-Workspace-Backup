Description: hey fam! my name is Daniil Romanov, also known as @cyberomanov (https://t.me/cyberomanov).

my main vision and activity is to teach anyone how to set up and support his own node. that’s why I created my personal blog about node-running at the beginning of 2021.

@how_to_node (https://t.me/how_to_node) - is a healthy community of validators of all ages and skills. nowadays it counting around 12k participants.

at the same time, @how_to_node is the humble corner of the creator where i post updates and guides about interesting for me projects.

i have several active testnets and around 20 mainnets in my portfolio (https://cyberomanov.me/), some foundation delegations and even a grant.

my self-identity, @how_to_node history of creation and ideology, list of supported networks, my achievements and contributions to projects can be found here (https://github.com/cyberomanov/cyberomanov/blob/main/self-identity.md).

thank you for your time and have a great day!
