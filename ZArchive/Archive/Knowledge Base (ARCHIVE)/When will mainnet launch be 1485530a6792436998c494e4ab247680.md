The mainnet launch does not currently have a specific date, but rather an estimated “window” when launch is anticipated to happen. The project is highly complex and has many components so deciding on and committing to a specific release date is a very significant and highly complex decision.

The actual launch date will be announced at some stage, but it will be based on many hundreds of factors such as planned runtime upgrades prior to launch, a runtime code audit, parachain decisions, community readiness, planning and too many other things to list. 

The following is a GitHub issue for the Mainnet Release Plan which you can read to get some idea of the factors involved in mainnet launch:
