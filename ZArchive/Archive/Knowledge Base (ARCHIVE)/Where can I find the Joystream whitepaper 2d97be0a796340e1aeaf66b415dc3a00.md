Joystream used to have a whitepaper, however it was written when the project was first launched in 2018. Since that time, many parts of the project have changed significantly, so the whitepaper is of little relevance any more and as such is no longer distributed in any form, in order to avoid confusion.

In place of the whitepaper, the best place to go is the Joystream Handbook ([https://joystream.gitbook.io/](https://joystream.gitbook.io/)). The Handbook contains high level technical information about many components of the platform.

There are no plans to update or reissue the whitepaper as it would require a significant investment of time from critical project personnel for very little benefit, when the Gitbook explains almost all technical aspects in great detail.

If you have looked through the Gitbook and there is some technical aspect you can’t understand and want more information, you can always ask in the Discord or through other channels for further guidance.
