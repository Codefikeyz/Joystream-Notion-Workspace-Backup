The tokenomics of the Joystream project are **not finalized** at this point in time (as of April 25, 2022).

However, there are a few important notes to consider:

- The Joystream project will **not** have a `fixed issuance` unlike many crypto projects. The project will launch with a set amount of tokens from its `genesis block`. The exact initial distribution has not been finalized yet.
- After the project’s launch the tokenomics will change over time based on a variety of factors:
    - The governance system allows the DAO to issue more tokens through a variety of mechanisms. There are budgets and other items that can issue additional tokens over time.
    - Transactions, fees, stake and other elements can permanently `burn` tokens.
    - **There is no way to predict either of these**, therefore there is no typical `tokenomics` page like you may find on other projects. It all depends on governance decisions, user activity and other elements.

Below you can find an image of a prototype `tokenomics` page that will be introduced on the governance UI (`Pioneer`) which may help to better illustrate this (*NOTE: all numbers used here are purely for illustrative purposes, they have no bearing on actual project tokenomics*):
