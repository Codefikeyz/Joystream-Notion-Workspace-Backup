# Meet Your Validators (archive)

When nominating, you are at risk of having parts of your staked funds lost if the validator malfunctions or does a poor job, resulting in a reduced return on investment. This is why it is incumbent on all nominators to become familiar with what validators exist, and about the history and status of such validators. This is an effort which has to be done, not only when first selecting a validator, but continuously, as circumstances may change.

# How to Pick Validators?

Please read this breakdown to understand what to consider when selecting validators.

# +****Warning****

The inclusion of a validator on this list should not be interpreted as an endorsement of their effectiveness or safety as a validator, no such review has been conducted. They are merely included here so there is a simple way for nominators to learn what real world actors correspond to each on-chain validator. This page is meant to be a short-term solution until on-chain verification can be done.
