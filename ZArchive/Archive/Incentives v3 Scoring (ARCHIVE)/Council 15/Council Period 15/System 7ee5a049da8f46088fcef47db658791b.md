```markdown
* The minimum replication rate is 4 (replication_score)
  * Meaning all objects must be stored by at least 4 operated buckets at the end of the term
-> 1
* If any four storage nodes goes down at the same time, every object must still be available from at least two storage nodes (redundancy_score)
- > 0 
(11 bags in 5 buckets)
* If any four storage nodes goes down at the same time, every channel must still be able to upload to at least two storage nodes (emergency_score)
- > 0 
(11 bags in 5 buckets)
* All storage nodes are on the latest version of colossus (version_score)
-> 1
(Others not reacheable/active)
* All storage that has been in the working group for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and share the public url in the metadata (autonomy_score)
  * Will not be measured before scoring period 16
-> 1 (not checked)
* All storage nodes displays their location coordinates, node storage capacity and caching in the metadata, (transparancy_score)
-> 1
* No storage node stores more than 80% of their capacity (excess_capacity_score)
  * This may severely reduce performance
-> 0

* The maximum response time is 2h (response_score)
-> 1

The first three subscores are measured at some point during the last 14400 blocks.

The latter will be measured by creating an opening for @bwhm without any rewards, that should be invited to a bucket, but not set to accept new bags, and only (manually) assigned a single existing "testing" bag. If the node goes down, the bag must be removed.

SYSTEM_SCORE = 0.125*(replication_score + redundancy_score + emergency_score + version_score + autonomy_score + transparancy_score + excess_capacity_score + response_score)
= 0.5
