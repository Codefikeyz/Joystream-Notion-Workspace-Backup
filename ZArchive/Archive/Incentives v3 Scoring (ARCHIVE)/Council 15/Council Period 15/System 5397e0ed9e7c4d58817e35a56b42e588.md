```
Although well intended and partially correct given the purpose of `bucket_families` , the current system causes issues for many reasons, two of which are easy to fix:

* Buckets are assigned more bags than they should, and needs to fetch objects from a storage provider themselves, before they can serve them
* High latency between user, the player/orion and the distributor nodes, given most users residing Europe and the CIS

Redesign the distributor system, to reduce these errors.

#### Parameters

* **All** families/buckets are well distributed across Europe and the CIS (`coverage_score`)
  * No **active** distributor operates from any other geographical location
-> 0

* All objects must be available from at least 2 operators in each family (`redundancy_score`)

-> 0

* All distributor nodes are on the latest version of `argus` (`version_score`)
-> 1
(all reachable)

* All distributors that has been operating for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and share the public url in the metadata (`autonomy_score`)
  * Will not be measured before scoring period 16

-> 1

* All distributor nodes displays their location coordinates, node storage capacity and caching in the metadata,   (`transparancy_score`)
  * These should be the same numbers as `limits.storage` `limits.maxCachedItemSize` in the `config.yml` file
-> 0

* No distributor node stores more than 80% of their capacity (`excess_capacity_score`)
  * This may severely reduce performance
-> 0

* The maximum response time is 2h (`response_score)`
-> 1
(Opening made)

The first five subscores are measured at some point during the last 14400 blocks of the scoring period.

The latter will be measured by creating an opening for `@bwhm` without any rewards, that should be invited to a bucket and set as serving, but not accept any bags. If the node goes down, it must be set to not serving.

```
All subscores are graded binary

  SYSTEM_SCORE = (1/7)*(coverage_score + redundancy_score + version_score + autonomy_score + transparancy_score + excess_capacity_score + response_score)
= 0.4285714286
```
