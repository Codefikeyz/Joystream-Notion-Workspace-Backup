## General questions and comments

- Overall thorough, and most things addressed.
- This group has perhaps had the most difficult working environment, but was hoping a little more elaboration

A summary of the recruiting process for the period, including

- Discord groups visited and for each
    - a TL;DR about the discord group/project visited
        - Not exactly what I was looking for here
    - the opening message that was posted
    - amount of users engaging over DMs
    - how many users
        - joined our discord
            - Nice :)
        - was added to the CRM (get `personId)`
        - registered a membership (get `memberId`)
            - Nicer :)
        - got assigned a bounty (get `bountyId`)
- Perform a status update for all users recruited, by an entry in the `CRM` in previous periods.
    - How many were assigned a bounty, and how many how many completed it?
    - How many has had a role?
    - What are the biggest success stories, and what can we learn from that?
