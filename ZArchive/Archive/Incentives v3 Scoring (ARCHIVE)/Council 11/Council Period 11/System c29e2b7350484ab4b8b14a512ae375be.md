```markdown
* The minimum replication rate is 5 (`replication_score`)
* The excess capacity required, for objects and size, must be higher than the "worst" of:

    * 4x last period numbers (not current)
    * 3x the highest period over the last 4 periods (not including current)

    (`excess_capacity_score`)
* Maximum allowed failure probability is 80%, meaning all bags in the top 10% of EITHER:

    * total size stored
    * total objects stored
    * amount of uploads over the last period

    must be able to have at least 80% chance of being able to upload 1 object successfully, despite 2 storage nodes hypotethically being down (`emergency_score)`
* The maximum response time is 2h (`response_score)`

The first three subscores are measured at some point during the last 14400 blocks.

The latter will be measured by creating an opening for `@bwhm` without any rewards, that should be invited to a bucket, but not set to accept new bags, and only (manually) assigned a single existing "testing" bag. If the node goes down, the bag must be removed.

#### Scoring Calculations

Then:

replication_score = 1

// Note - would make it easier for yourself if you configure dynamic policy to 5!

excess_capacity_score = 0.5

// looks clearly ok, but stats are missing

emergency_score = 0

response_score = 1

// opening was made, so my fault only!

SYSTEM_SCORE = 0.25*(replication_score + excess_capacity_score + emergency_score + response_score)
= 0.25(1+0.5+0+1) = 0.625
```
