## Questions and Comments

- No changes to setup, despite requested for a while now…
- Lots of missing, and not improved data.
- Of the 14 points:
    - 2 are not addressed (at all)
    - 4 are not addressed (properly)
    - 4 are presented poorly (generous)
    - `(14-2-(0.6*8))/14 = 0.5142857143`
        
        stricter with the partials this time

In addition to what is outlined in the [#working-group-period-plan](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score.md#working-group-period-plan), the working group report must publish a separate report covering

- What was the setup of distribution family buckets, and buckets at the beginning and end of the term.
- What was the dynamic policy at the beginning and end of the term.
    - Not addressed
