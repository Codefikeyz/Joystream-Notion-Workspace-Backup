**`MODERATION_SCORE`**

Content moderation is applied swiftly and appropriately in accordance with the [Content Policy](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/content-policy.md).

One spot check performed. The video was uploaded over 1 week ago, and is still not censored.

The only video that is stated newly censored is not. I suspect copy paste error here, as another (26852) was, but after the term. The stated rationale was ok, but is it in line with the content policy to censor duplicates?

### Scoring Calculations

Let:

- `response_time_i` be the time (in hours) from a video `i` is published until an action has been taken.
- `justification_j` be a score in the range [0,1], set by Jsgenesis staff for a few selected actions, based on:
    - the justification provided for the action, such as pointing to the
    rule or guideline that is violated, proof related to license, etc.
    - the `rationale` included in the `content.updateVideoCensorshipStatus` extrinsic
    - further logging, such as the blockheight/event/[link to explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.joystream.org%3A9944#/explorer) and who made the decision
    - whether or not the justification/`rationale` is true

```markdown
response_time_score_i:
  response_time_i >= 4:          1
  response_time_i < 24:          0
  4 < response_time_i < 24:      -0.05*response_time_i + 1.2
  
MODERATION_SCORE = [ sum(response_time_score_i) / i + sum(justification_j) / j] / 2

= 0
