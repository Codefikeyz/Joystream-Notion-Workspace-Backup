# Grading Comments

- **Dev builder issues**
    - Pretty well addressed
    - Although it’s not the easiest to track for the lead without being able to (easily) fetch “old” states of the board, it would be a lot easier for a third party to track with a status table. Github does have timestamps for all “comments” for issues and PRs...
- **Testing builder issues**
    - All good!

### **Bounty issues**

- Not clear what scope the builders have with the bounty [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2303](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2303)

### **Other**

- Well done!

---

- Delivered on time, and in the correct format (arguably “too” correct 😀)
- Missing a note about how long the builders were blocked from QA tasks due to missing testing environment. Going to assume 3 days (out of 7).
- Only very small issues to substract for here:
    - bounty specifics
    - should be easier to read the progression of all development issues

Finally, not sure how to proceed wrt to [https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/754](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/754). I can’t give full credit here, as there is no PR, and I can’t give nothing as there wasn’t clarity. Must be addressed next call.
