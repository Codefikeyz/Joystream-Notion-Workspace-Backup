```markdown
CONTENT_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + FEATURING_SCORE + MODERATION_SCORE]/(4*2^{N})
= [0.3+0.2+0+1]/(4*2^{1}) = 0.188
```

GENERAL_WG_SCORE = ?

CONTENT_SCORE = [? + 0.2 + 0 + 1]/(4*2^{1})

The group suffered a catastrophic error, `Logging does not occur`, since the logging mandated under the FEATURING_SCORE did not occur.
