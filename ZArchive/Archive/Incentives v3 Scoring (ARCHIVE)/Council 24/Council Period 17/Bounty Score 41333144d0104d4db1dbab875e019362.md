### Scope

- Title
- High level summary and purpose
- Time estimate to complete, assuming some relevant skills, but little to no experience with Joystream or the working group
- Detailed scope of work, relevant for either a specific part of the working group score, or more general
    - if specific, this implies the group is looking for a worker in this sub-section
- Discord handle and `memberId` of a worker (or the Lead) WG to act as the oracle for the bounty
