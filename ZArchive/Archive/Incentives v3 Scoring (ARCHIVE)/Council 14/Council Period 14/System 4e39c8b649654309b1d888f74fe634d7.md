```markdown

replication_score = 1

// No bag under!

excess_capacity_score = 1

// Nice to see stats!

emergency_score = 0

// See reference below

response_score = 1

// opening was made, so my fault only!

SYSTEM_SCORE = 0.25*(replication_score + excess_capacity_score + emergency_score + response_score)
= 0.25(1+1+0+1) = 0.75
