```markdown
All subscores are graded binary

coverage_score = 0
// False
redundancy_score = 0
// Plenty of families not having 3+ buckets/operators
version_score = 1
/*
	- 13 nodes running version 0.1.2
  - 0 nodes were either not up, or not displaying the version
  - 1 nodes running OTHER versions 
*(Not reachable, so not counted)
*/
transparancy_score = 0
// 1 operating node does not display this
excess_capacity_score = 0
// All buckets seem to distribute everything, or close to that.
response_score = 0
// No opening

  SYSTEM_SCORE = (1/6)*(coverage_score + redundancy_score + version_score + transparancy_score + excess_capacity_score + response_score)

### Parameters

- All families/buckets well distributed across Europe and the CIS (`coverage_score`)
- All objects must be available from at least 2 buckets in each family
    - The top 10 most videos must be available from at least 3 buckets in each family (`redundancy_score`)
- All distributor nodes are on the latest version of `argus` (`version_score`)
- All distributor nodes displays their location coordinates and node capacity in the metadata, (`transparancy_score`)
- No distributor node stores more than 60% of their capacity (`excess_capacity_score`)
- The maximum response time is 2h (`response_score)`

The first five subscores are measured at some point during the last 14400 blocks.

The latter will be measured by creating an opening for `@bwhm`
 without any rewards, that should be invited to a bucket and set as 
serving, but not accept any bags. If the node goes down, it must be set 
to not serving.
