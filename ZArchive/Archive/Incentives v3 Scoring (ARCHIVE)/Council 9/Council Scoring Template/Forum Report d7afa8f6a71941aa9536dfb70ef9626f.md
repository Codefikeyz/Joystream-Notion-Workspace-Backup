Incorrect data added, and lots of unclear and/or unaddressed items.

## Questions and comments:

Categories:

- “Document with new categories” - It appears none of these were added.
    - Why are they listed?
    - Was a proposal made?

Statistics:

- *How many threads were created* - incorrect data (14 stated, 29 actual)
- *How many posts were created of each type* - not addressed
- *How many posts were deleted* - not addressed?
- The report states: “*Forum Threads Moderated”* - and claims 7:
    - Which ones?
    - Why?
    - When?

In addition to what is outlined in the [#working-group-summary](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score.md#working-group-summary), the working group report must include a section covering

- Changes made to category structure, and why
- Forum statistics over the course of the scoring period, meaning
    - How many threads were created
    - How many threads were deleted
    - How many posts were created of each type
    - How many posts were deleted
- A summary of all `forum` (except regular posting) transactions made by the group, who made it, and why

Whereas the same deadline as general report applies, there is no requirement to submit a temporary report for this.
