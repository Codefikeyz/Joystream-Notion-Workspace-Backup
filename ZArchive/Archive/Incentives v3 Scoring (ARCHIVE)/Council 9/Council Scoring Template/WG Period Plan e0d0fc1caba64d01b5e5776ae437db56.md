Although technically addressing most specific items, some more meat would be nice.

## Questions and comments

- What can be done to get the current contributors allocate more time?

### Scope

All working group period plans have the same scope:

- Current group composition.
- Plan for hirings (emphasizing newcomers).
- Planned firings.
- Onboarding plans for newcomers.
- Ranked list of suggestions for problems groups should attempt to
tackle, and how, with corresponding budgeting, marketing or other
resources needed from council or Jsgenesis.

**Note:** The plan for hiring and firings don't have to be specific members/workers, just the number of.
