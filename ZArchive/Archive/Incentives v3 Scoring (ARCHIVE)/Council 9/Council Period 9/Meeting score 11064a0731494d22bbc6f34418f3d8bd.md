```markdown
# attendance + minutes
Daily Standup: [(1+0.75+0.5+0.75+0.5) + (0.8*5)]/12 = 0.625
Handover: [(0.75+0.75)+(0.8+0)]/4 = 0.575
MEETING_SCORE = (0.625 + 0.575)/2 = 0.6
```

- Turnout of council members (n/m), for all handover and standups, where 80% is required to achieve a full score
- The quality and promptness of publishing the minutes of meeting,
where the score falls linearly from 1 to 0 if minutes are published
between 2 hour and 8 hours after the meeting started
