- `BOUNTY_SCORE` is a score computed by Jsgenesis staff
based on the quality of the groups openings, which will be in the range
[0, 1], and will emphasize things like
    - Appropriate and well defined scope, meaning it's related either to a general part of the working group, or specific task associated with a
    specific opening.
    - A time estimate for completion, which is between 30 minutes and 3 hours.
    - Proposes either the Lead, or another trusted worker in the group, as the oracle for the bounty.
