- `OPENING_SCORE` is a score computed by Jsgenesis staff
based on the quality (and existance) of the groups openings, which will
be in the range [0, 1], and will emphasize things like
    - No "downtime" without any openings, even just after filling or closing the old one
    - Quality of opening, in terms of information, requests and questions
    - Inquires and applications dealt with in a reasonable time and manner
