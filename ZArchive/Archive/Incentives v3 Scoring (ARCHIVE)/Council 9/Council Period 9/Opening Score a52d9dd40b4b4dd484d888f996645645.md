### Grading
* No "downtime" without any openings, even just after filling or closing the old one
  * 1
* Quality of opening, in terms of information, requests and questions
  * Both 9 and 10 are great (ex bounty/forum)
    * 1
* Inquires and applications dealt with in a reasonable time and manner
  * Impossible due to no forum post/contact (no new openings created)
  * A problem that an opening still has an applicant from 815879
  * 0

-> 0.667
