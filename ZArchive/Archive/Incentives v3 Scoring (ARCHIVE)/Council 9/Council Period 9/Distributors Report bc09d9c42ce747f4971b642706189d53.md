**Questions and comments**

- Report not posted in markdown in the forum.
- Generally ok, but from next period, this report would get a significantly lower score.

---

- What was the setup of distribution family buckets, and buckets at the beginning and end of the term.
    - This must be a table, very hard to read.
- What was the dynamic policy at the beginning and end of the term.
    - Not addressed
- How are bags distributed among the buckets in each bucket family.
    - Not readable, consider a table or anything else really
- What was the rationale behind the family bucket and bucket configuration, meaning
    - What geographical regions are the families meant to serve
    - Why was the specific dynamic bag policy chosen
    - How do you want to scale the system assuming a growth of 2x, 10x and 100x in terms of data objects and size
        - Fair to not update this every term, but this time, there were in fact some changes…
- How much bandwidth did the individual nodes consume during the period.
    - Acceptable shortcut, but needs to be improved
- How is the bandwidth usage distributed, meaning
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a day (peak hours and slow hours)
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a week (peak days and slow days)
    - How did bandwidth usage look across regions (which regions consumes the most, if accessible)
    - How did bandwidth usage look across nodes, operators, buckets and families
        - Good!
- How are distributors supposed to set their `config.yaml` file and why.
    - Good!
- What is the current running costs for the system, and a breakdown of said costs.
    - This needs a new review and improvement
- What, if anything, is the group doing the monitor the health of the system.
    - Good start, but what is done in case of issues? Is there any automatic or manual system in place?
- A list of all `storage` transactions (not `distributorWorkingGroup`) made by the lead, and the purpose behind them.
    - Although the `distributorWorkingGroup` transactions were also listed → good!
