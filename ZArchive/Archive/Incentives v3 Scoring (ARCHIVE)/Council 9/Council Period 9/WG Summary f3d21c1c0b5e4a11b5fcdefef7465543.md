## Questions

- The summary says the amount spent was `~7266400 tJOY` but this does not reflect on-chain data. Despite this the Notion board does include a good amount of detail, so it would be useful to know how exactly this budget/spending data was gathered by the WG. Was a script used or was data from Pioneer alone used?
