### **Scope**

- Prioritization to each working group about what they should focus on solving.
    - Completed. Included every WG and broke down each into subtasks and included links when external things were referenced which is a good practice. They were also realistic and actionable points to focus on.
- How total $tJOY budget will be allocated across groups and council.
    - Completed. Included a detailed breakdown.
- Set the schedule for all the [#council-meetings](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/#council-meetings) until the council period is over.
    - Completed
- List all known tasks to be assigned to individual council members, and add them to the council period task tracker on the Notion board.
    - Completed. WGs were assigned to individual CMs and other tasks like creating the plan were more broadly assigned. Detailed and actionable.
- The council are further *encouraged* to include specific workflows for items such as:
    - How to follow up each working group, and by whom
        - Included an expansive section titled **`*Liaisons: Intro for new council members*`** which included good sets of questions to address this by newer less experienced CMs.
    - How budgets are managed, and by whom
        - Completed but didn’t go as far as assigning budgets to individual users. It was mentioned that this is discussed during stand up meetings though.
    - Who is responsible for taking and publishing minutes
        - Completed
    - etc.
