- The submitted summary forum post does not seem to include much of what was asked for within the scope of the scope of the requirements: [https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score.md#scope](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score.md#scope)
- The summary posted on the forum is completely different to the one on Notion ([CWG summary](https://www.notion.so/CWG-summary-e4780117e8f9455681a6a2edf7f1052d?pvs=21)) and even if this were to be considered, it still fails to address many requirements such as
    - `• Accounting of how much was spent on what.`
    - `• Changes made to the corresponding notion board.`
    - `• A summary on how well the working group served it's intended purpose.`
    - `• Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built in to this working group, other working groups, the council or Jsgenesis' role, in order to increase overall effectiveness of the group or the project.`
- Given at least something was done on Notion, the score is 0.1
