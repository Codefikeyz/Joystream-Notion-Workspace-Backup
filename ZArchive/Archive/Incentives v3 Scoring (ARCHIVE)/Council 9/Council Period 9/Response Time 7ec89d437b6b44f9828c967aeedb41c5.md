```markdown
Each instance of a new person joining the Discord and sending a message in the #start-here channel will be given points as follows:

    An initial response in under two minutes yields 1 point
    An initial response between two minutes and five minutes yields 0.8 point
    An initial response between five minutes and ten minutes yields 0.5 points
    An initial response after ten minutes has passed yields zero points
    An initial response or no response after more than 60 minutes yields -1 point.

RESPONSE_TIME_SCORE =
SUM(RESPONSE TIME POINTS)/TOTAL NEW JOINERS
= 1
