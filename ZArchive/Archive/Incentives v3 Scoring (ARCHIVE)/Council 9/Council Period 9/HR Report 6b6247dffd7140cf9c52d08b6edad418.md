Overall, excellent report! Thanks for the tables :)

Would very much appreciate if you could include memberId of all the people assigned bounties next time, I was unable to find out who `Premium`, `Web3 designer` and `Oliver Stephen` was/is 

# Questions and comments

- Missing “Include a link to the public board, and any contact made with the Lead of the group”
- “**What bounties, regardless of which council period it was started, are being worked on, which are not yet completed, and what progress was made in this period, as well as a new ETA on delivery.”**
    - Here, I’d want a little more info. Eg: “we spoke to ‘xyz’ and they expect to be done …”
- Ref reward size: I see your point, but I don’t know if it should matter for smaller bounties.
