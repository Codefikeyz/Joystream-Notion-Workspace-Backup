**Questions and comments**

- Missing some information on the progress/status of https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/767
- Although key information is well covered (with the exception of the above), as requested before: (a) table(s) would be ideal for all issue tracking
- “Other” is almost entirely ignored
