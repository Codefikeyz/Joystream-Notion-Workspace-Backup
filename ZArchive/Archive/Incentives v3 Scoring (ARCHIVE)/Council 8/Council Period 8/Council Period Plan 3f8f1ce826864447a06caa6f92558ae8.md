Overall, very well outlined and explained. Most issues are small, although the point about communicating the plans seems like it became a relevant question.

It was submitted *very late* by all reasonable ways to interpret the deadlines.

### **Scope**

- Prioritization to each working group about what they should focus on solving.
    - This was clearly laid out and provided a good breakdown of current issues and potential solutions across all working groups.
    - Was this communicated to the Leads? If so, how?
- How total $tJOY budget will be allocated across groups and council.
    - The budget allocation clearly laid out expected spending, including validator rewards and took into account the subsidies provided for the Storage and Distributor WGs. It was easy to understand and parse.
- Set the schedule for all the [#council-meetings](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/#council-meetings) until the council period is over.
    - Completed
- List all known tasks to be assigned to individual council members, and add them to the council period task tracker on the Notion board.
    - Completed. Responsibilities were clearly assigned and it was easy to understand.
- The council are further *encouraged* to include specific workflows for items such as:
    - How to follow up each working group, and by whom
        - Completed
        - Not addressed how or IF this was communicated to the Leads.
    - How budgets are managed, and by whom
        - Completed
    - Who is responsible for taking and publishing minutes
        - Completed
