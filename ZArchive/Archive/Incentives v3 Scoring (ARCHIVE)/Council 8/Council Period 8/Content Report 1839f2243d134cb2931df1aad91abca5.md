- Incorrect amount of videos created (22 stated, 24 actual)
- Table says “Downloaded” - presumably the ones the Lead downloaded and checked?

    - Stated they WILL be censored and which in another section.
    - Reason also stated here.
    - Not done yet

*All changes made to the featured content.*

- The featuring done is not part of the metrics/scope.

Remaining items unaddressed.
