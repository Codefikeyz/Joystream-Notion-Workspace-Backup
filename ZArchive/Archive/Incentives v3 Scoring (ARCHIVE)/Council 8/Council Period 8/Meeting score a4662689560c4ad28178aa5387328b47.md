Was there a “ticket tracker” board?

Standups:

- Held: Mon-Fri
- Participants: 3/5 every time ex friday (2/5)
- Minutes: excellent, but not on the forum?

Handover 1:

- Participation:
    - All
- Minutes: missing attendance. Not on the forum?

Handover 2:

- Participation:
    - kirill, l1dev, freakstatic (igrex not part of that council)
- Minutes: excellent, but not on the forum?

A little tough to grade as first time:

```markdown
Daily Standup: [(0.75*4+0.5) + (0.8*5)]/12 = 0.625
Handover: [(1+0.75) + (0.6+0.8)]/4 = 0.7875
MEETING_SCORE = (0.625 + 0.7875)/2 = 0.70625
```

- Turnout of council members (n/m), for all handover and standups, where 80% is required to achieve a full score
- The quality and promptness of publishing the minutes of meeting,
where the score falls linearly from 1 to 0 if minutes are published
between 2 hour and 8 hours after the meeting started
