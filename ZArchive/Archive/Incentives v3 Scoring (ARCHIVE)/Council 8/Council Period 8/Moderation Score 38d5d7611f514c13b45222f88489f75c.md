Not clear how to grade this. On the one hand, we have not made any spotchecks, and are not aware of any posts that should have been moderated. On the other hand, the report states seven threads were moderated, without disclosing further.

Due to the possibility of communication error, this score gets set to 1, but it is considered a catastrophic error that nothing is outlined further.
