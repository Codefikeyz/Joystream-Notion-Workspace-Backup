#### Scoring Calculations

Jsgenesis will assign a score in the range \[0,1] based on:

* The quality of the report
	- Not done 
	-> 0
* The quality of the guide 
	- Guide seems great for deploying a server (helpdful for "future" Leads)
  - nothing for the operators
	-> 0.5
* The amount of nodes that connected to the server (binary)
	- Not documented, but clear that many, if not all, are reporting
	-> 1
```

```markdown
* Deploying and using the server, meaning:
  * Setup and configurations
  * Extracting and parsing the data
  * What it provides for a Lead
* Operators to report to it
```
