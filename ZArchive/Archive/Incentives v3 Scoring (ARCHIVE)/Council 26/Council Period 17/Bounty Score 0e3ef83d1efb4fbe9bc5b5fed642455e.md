- Not the most creative, but checks all the boxes!
- Also actually used in the opening → great!

## Bounty Score

The HR group is responsible for onboarding new people, by 
providing them a bounty or two where they can show what they can do to 
contribute. Assuming they are capable, it is important that they are 
given a chance to proceed further, and get a role where they belong.

However, the Leads shouldn't have to hire anyone unless 
there is a reason they are qualified, meaning the HR group needs to be 
able to test them somehow.

For each new term, the group must present at least one 
bounty that a newcomer can address in order to prove themselves for the 
group in question.

### Scope

- Title
- High level summary and purpose
- Time estimate to complete, assuming some relevant skills, but little to no experience with Joystream or the working group
- Detailed scope of work, relevant for either a specific part of the working group score, or more general
    - if specific, this implies the group is looking for a worker in this sub-section
- Discord handle and `memberId` of a worker (or the Lead) WG to act as the oracle for the bounty
