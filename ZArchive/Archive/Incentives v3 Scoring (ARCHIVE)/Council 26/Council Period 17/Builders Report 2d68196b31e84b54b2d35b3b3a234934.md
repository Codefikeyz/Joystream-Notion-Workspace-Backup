## Questions and comments

- All the items addressed are done very thoroughly and provides a lot of insight into the WGs performance, issues (not the github kind) and processes.
- Especially nice to see much improved reporting on the bounties and time spent on testing.
    - It is useful for the purposes of knowing how much a ticket is “worth” in time compared to other tasks, but not strictly necessary.
- The “other” part was not addressed, but it was communicated during a call that:
    - More “implement” instead of “fix” on pioneer issues, and
    - More backend in general is requested.
