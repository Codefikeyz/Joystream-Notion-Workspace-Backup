**Questions and comments**

- This report is, unfortunately, the best example of why the above comment was made.
- This was good initially, but now it’s clear that:
    - The group isn’t checking the metrics
    - The group isn’t checking the feedback
- A lot of work is needed to improve presentation, and clarification
- Is the `RESEARCH_SCORE` done? Why haven’t anyone posted this?
- Of the 14 points:
    - 2 are not addressed (at all)
    - 4 are not addressed (properly)
    - 4 are presented poorly (generous)
    - `(14-2-0.5*(8))/14 = 8/14 = 0.571`

---

- What was the setup of distribution family buckets, and buckets at the beginning and end of the term.
    - Presented in a very (still) bad way
- What was the dynamic policy at the beginning and end of the term.
    - Not addressed
- How are bags distributed among the buckets in each bucket family.
    - Not addressed properly (but cool thing!)
- What was the rationale behind the family bucket and bucket configuration, meaning
    - What geographical regions are the families meant to serve
        - Not addressed properly - be specific
    - Why was the specific dynamic bag policy chosen
        - Not addressed properly - be specific
    - How do you want to scale the system assuming a growth of 2x, 10x and 100x in terms of data objects and size
        - Not addressed properly
- How much bandwidth did the individual nodes consume during the period.
    - Have commented on this before - this needs finer logging
- How is the bandwidth usage distributed, meaning
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a day (peak hours and slow hours)
        - What is peak and slow?
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a week (peak days and slow days)
        - What is peak and slow?
    - How did bandwidth usage look across regions (which regions consumes the most, if accessible)
        - Not addressed
    - How did bandwidth usage look across nodes, operators, buckets and families
- How are distributors supposed to set their `config.yaml` file and why.
- What is the current running costs for the system, and a breakdown of said costs.
    - Presented in a very (still) bad way
- What, if anything, is the group doing the monitor the health of the system.
    - Is elastic search actually deployed? This would be nice to include in a report!
- A list of all `storage` transactions (not `distributorWorkingGroup`) made by the lead, and the purpose behind them.
    - Reward stuff not needed
