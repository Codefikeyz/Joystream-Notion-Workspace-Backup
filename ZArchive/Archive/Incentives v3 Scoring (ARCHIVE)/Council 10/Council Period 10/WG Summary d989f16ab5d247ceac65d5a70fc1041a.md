This WG summary includes incorrect budget information. During the previous grading the lead stated they had used manual calculations rather than a script to calculate this data ([https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/943152435432669266/980804303751090206](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/943152435432669266/980804303751090206)). This is not ideal.
