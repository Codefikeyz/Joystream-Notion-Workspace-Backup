**Questions and comments**

- Overall, nice improvement.
- I think dmitry will be fine with this - ask!
- I could be an ass and keep on pushing for tables, but I did get most of the info I wanted this way. A few notes, that would make it easier for the reader (and a tip for you when writing):
    - Include the associated PR, eg:
        - https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2831 resolved with https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/3128
    - If you hover your mouse over “…commented `6 days ago`" github will give you a timestamp to copy :)
- The **Other** part is still ignored. I think it would be good to learn a little more about this.
    - This is the only real issue now.

    - Are there any "kinds" of issues the group wants more of, relative to the their stack
