The submitted report did not cover most of what was required for the Marketing WG’s report.

In addition to what is outlined in the [#working-group-summary](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/master/testnet/council-period-scoring/#working-group-summary) the working group report must publish a separate report covering working group specific stats

- A summary of the recruiting process for the period, including
    - Discord groups visited and for each
        - a TL;DR about the discord group/project visited
        - the opening message that was posted
        - amount of users engaging over DMs
        - how many users
            - joined our discord
            - was added to the CRM (get `personId)`
            - registered a membership (get `memberId`)
            - got assigned a bounty (get `bountyId`)
    - Perform a status update for all users recruited, by an entry in the `CRM` in previous periods.
        - How many were assigned a bounty, and how many how many completed it?
        - How many has had a role?
        - What are the biggest success stories, and what can we learn from that?
