```markdown
# attendance + minutes
Daily Standup: (0.75+0.5+0.75+0.5+0.75+1)+(1*6)]/6 = 0.8541666667
Handover: [(1+1)+(0.75+1)]/4 = 0.9375
MEETING_SCORE = (0.8541666667 + 0.9375)/2 =0.8958333333

- Turnout of council members (n/m), for all handover and standups, where 80% is required to achieve a full score
- The quality and promptness of publishing the minutes of meeting,
where the score falls linearly from 1 to 0 if minutes are published
between 2 hour and 8 hours after the meeting started
