As stated last period:
”In general, requirements for WG Report are going up from the next period.”

**Questions and comments**

- It seems like a lot of the actual work is being done, but not documented, logged and, perhaps, just not in an organized fashion?
- Overall, there are 19 points to address:
    - About half are attempted, incomplete or mixed, the rest is not.
- It’s a bit frustrating, because I can tell you are working hard. Videos are censored, and uncensored after last period feedback…

---

**During the period**

- All channels and videos by `Id` created. For each, include
    - metadata, meaning (at least) `title`, `category`, `license`, `objectId`(s)
        - All found correctly in the google spreadsheet, but not easy to find…!
        - Data on the front page incorrect… (saying 19)
    - content directory status, meaning (at least) `isCensored`, `isPublic`, whether each object `isAccepted`
        - Not addressed
    - curator specific information, such as in which block it was created, the `createdAt` and `updatedAt`timestamps, for the purpose of being able to review a video that gets updated should be dealt with (eg. censored or no longer censored)
        - Some (except blocks) found correctly in the google spreadsheet, but not easy to find…!
- All channels and videos by `Id` updated. For each, include what the change was and when it was made.
    - Not addressed
- Channel or video categories created or deleted, when and why.
    - Not addressed, but nothing to report? (should still be included!)
- All `NFT`s created, and their `Id`
    - Done for 1/5, but no ID
- All `NFT`s sold, and the auction type and `Id`
    - Not addressed
- All moderation actions taken by the group, for which channels/video and why. This must include
    - `Id`
    - action taken
    - justification (longer and "off-chain" - see `MODERATION_SCORE`)
    - `rationale` (if applicable)
    - block height/event/[link to explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.joystream.org%3A9944#/explorer) if a transaction was made
    - the `curatorId` which made the transaction
        - Not done. Lots of moderation performed - why not logged properly?
- All requests made to storage working group lead, related to moderation.
    - Not addressed
- All changes made to the featured content, with precise logs (see `FEATURING_SCORE`)
    - Hero changed, but bad logs :(

**For the content directory as a whole**

- None addressed (below)
- Total amount of videos
- Total amount of channels
- Total amount of `NFT`s
- Amount of videos hidden and censored.
