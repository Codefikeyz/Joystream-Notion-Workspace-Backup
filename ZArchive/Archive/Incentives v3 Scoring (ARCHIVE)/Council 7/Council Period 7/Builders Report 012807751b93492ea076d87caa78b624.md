Notes:

- **Dev builder/General issues**
    - All good, except comments from last period not addressed:
        - Pretty well addressed
        - Although it’s not the easiest to track for the lead without being able to (easily) fetch “old” states of the board, it would be a lot easier for a third party to track with a status table. Github does have timestamps for all “comments” for issues and PRs...
- **Testing builder issues**
    - All good!
- **Bounty issues**
    - Misunderstanding clarified
- **Other**
    - Most points addressed, but missing some info about the team stack and “wants”

In addition to what is outlined in the [#working-group-period-plan](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/58e635d7391893b718b137c69a182199aeb66ab8/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score.md#working-group-period-plan), the working group report must include a section covering
