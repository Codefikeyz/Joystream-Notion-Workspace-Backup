As “only” two are reported, despite 3 having been created:

```markdown
BOUNTY_SCORE = 0.667
```

---

Is the number of bounties assigned to new users joining 
the #start-here channel divided by the assignment target for the round. 
For round 5 onwards, the bounty target is `3`.

The score cannot exceed 1, so, for example, if 4 bounties 
are assigned and created in Pioneer for new participants and the 
assignment target is 3, the score would be `1.000`. If the number of bounties assigned is 2, the score would be `0.667`.
