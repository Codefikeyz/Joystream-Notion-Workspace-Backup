Posted ~48h before the period was over, and not on the forum.

On one hand, it was clearly stated ahead of time grading would be late, meaning plans had to made based on what was known at the time. On the other hand, deadlines aren’t well managed by any party.

The plan did not address anything substantial beyond current state of the budgets, and an estimate on the spending which was not followed.

### Motivation

Give Jsgenesis visibility into the priorities of the 
council, and also serve as a canonical document to focus everyone in the council around a clearly defined plan.

### 

### Scope

- Prioritization to each working group about what they should focus on solving.
- How total $tJOY budget will be allocated across groups and council.

### 

### Submission

The plan itself must be written as a markdown document in English, in the forum category `Governance>Council Reports`,
 as a thread which has the title which includes the council period ID. 
The council must pass a text proposal (add link when proposal list is 
in) which references the plan on the forum.

If there is a need to link to extra information, statistics, etc. these should be in the notion board.
