Overall, very good and informative.

## Notes

*Removing failing nodes from distribution:*

- Why was so many nodes set to off? It seems a big problem having that many go down. When and why?
- Were they turned back on? When and why?

*Per hour perspective*

- This is really useful already as is, but as discussed, would be great to have even more precise data on locations etc.

*Snapshot of current bags per worker nodes:*

- This is not a very useful way of presenting the data.

---

- What was the setup of distribution family buckets, and buckets at the beginning and end of the term.
- What was the dynamic policy at the beginning and end of the term.
- How are bags distributed among the buckets in each bucket family.
- What was the rationale behind the family bucket and bucket configuration, meaning
    - What geographical regions are the families meant to serve
    - Why was the specific dynamic bag policy chosen
    - How do you want to scale the system assuming a growth of 2x, 10x and 100x in terms of data objects and size
- How much bandwidth did the individual nodes consume during the period.
- How is the bandwidth usage distributed, meaning
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a day (peak hours and slow hours)
    - How did bandwidth usage look over a week (peak days and slow days)
    - How did bandwidth usage look across regions (which regions consumes the most, if accessible)
    - How did bandwidth usage look across nodes, operators, buckets and families
- How are distributors supposed to set their `config.yaml` file and why.
- What is the current running costs for the system, and a breakdown of said costs.
- What, if anything, is the group doing the monitor the health of the system.
- A list of all `storage` transactions (not `distributorWorkingGroup`) made by the lead, and the purpose behind them.
