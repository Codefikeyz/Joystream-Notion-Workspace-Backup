```markdown
query Failed_Uploads {
  storageDataObjects (limit:1000000, where:{createdAt_gte:"2022-05-07T22:30:18.000Z",createdAt_lte:"2022-05-14T22:51:12.000Z"}) {
    id
    isAccepted
    size
    ipfsHash
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    storageBag {
      id
      storageBuckets {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only `isAccepted` is strictly needed, but the others includes context should the Lead include reasons to avoid in their reports.

```markdown
UPLOAD_SCORE = (successful_uploads/total_uploads - 0.80)/0.20
= (111/(111+18) - 0.8)/0.2) = 0.302
```

**Update**

Based on the report, 16/18 failures (bag 2333) doesn’t count:

```markdown
UPLOAD_SCORE = (successful_uploads/total_uploads - 0.80)/0.20
= (111/(111+2) - 0.8)/0.2) = 0.912
```
