**Motivation**

- Allow Jsgenesis to update the [#council-period-parameters](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/cac5977adcc723456504db2350cc0faaeacf5e37/testnet/testnet-rewards.md#council-period-parameters) and [#network-performance-score](https://github.com/Joystream/handbook/blob/cac5977adcc723456504db2350cc0faaeacf5e37/testnet/council-period-scoring/#network-performance-score) metrics for the next period based on up to date and accurate information.
- Allow the possible next council to have good information about the most urgent matters and status of the network.
