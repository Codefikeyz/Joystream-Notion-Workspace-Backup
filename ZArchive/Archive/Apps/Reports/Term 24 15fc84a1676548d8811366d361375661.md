# Term 24

## Term 24 plan

### 1. **Group composition**

| Worker ID | Member ID | Member handle | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 542 | `jsmoon` | gateway |
| 7 | 2233 | `klaudiusz` | lead |

### 2. **Group budget**

**JOY/USDT EMA30: 0.039** USDT

| **Item** | **USDT** | **JOY** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway salaries | ??? | ??? | Currently AWG hires only a single gateway - l1.media. Recently the gateway has not been working and contact with the operator wasn’t established. Until contact is restored and there is clean plan for gateway maintenance, rewards are set to 0. So it’s not clear whether the rewards will be updated during term 24. |
| Lead salary | $1,600.56 | 41,040 JOY |  |
| Group debt + buffer | $1,560 | 40,000 JOY | At the time of writing this plan (28.11), AWG has around ~23k JOY of missed rewards (debt). This value will increase by term end. I’m also asking for allocating a small buffer so that there’s always some dust in the budget and we don’t start incurring debt without a refill right after term ends. |
| Total Spending | $3,160.56 | 81,040 JOY |  |

### 3. **Group tasks**

1. Map out and research infrastructure operated by JSG. Find out: current traffic, technical architecture, number of servers, total costs. Based on this provide recommendations regarding DAO-operated infrastructure.
2. Prepare a plan for how the DAO should store source code of all its different tools. Currently we have a lot of tools in repos owned by specific DAO workers. This makes the discovery more difficult and also poses a risk of the code disappearing at some point in the future. Ideally, we have some kind of DAO-operated Github organization where we can store everything.
3. Prepare up-to-date and publicly-accessible list of all the different tools used by the DAO, like jscan, joyutils or council report script. For all of those tools I’d like to write down the maintainer, whether it incurs any costs, URL, etc. Based on this research, some kind of tool compensation plan may be presented to the council.

Comments:

1. The only gateway operator (l1.media) has been non-operating for the entire term so their salary has been 0.
2. The budget plan also included paying off the past group debt. As I’m not sure how to check exactly how much was spent on this, I did not include it in the spending report.

I have reached out to Mokhtar with all those questions. He said he will happily provide answers but I think he hasn’t yet found time to do so. Waiting for that and hopefully we can move forward next term.

I have discussed this topic with both ex-BWGL and JSG. It’s not fully clear in which direction to move yet. I have received access to main Joystream org and will do some tests to see if that works for us long-term. However, my gut feeling is that creating a separate organization fully under DAO control may be a better tradeoff.

This mostly wasn’t done. However, as a first step, a survey was created and filled out by most DAO workers, about which tools they use regularly and for what purposes. Will use that data to drive this effort forward.

> “Transfer” Dapplooker from BWG to AWG - hire the worker, inquire about costs and consider decreasing the salary.

Worker was hired, contact was established and some technical topics were discussed. Unfortunately, the salary discussion didn’t move forward yet as the Dapplooker representative was not available to discuss the changes. We need to finalize this next term.
