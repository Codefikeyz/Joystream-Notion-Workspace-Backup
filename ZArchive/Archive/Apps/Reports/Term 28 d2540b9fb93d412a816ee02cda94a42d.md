### 3. Group tasks

> Continue with last term’s task about DAO infrastructure research. This is at the moment waiting for Mokhtar’s response.
> 

Mokhtar didn’t reply, but he currently has other priorities. I’ve done some work on this on my own though. I’m renting 2 server for SWG/DWG monitoring and set them both up with RPC and QN endpoints that are load balanced via Cloudflare. So we already have some alt infra available. We should still formalise DAO’s plan on this matter though.

> Test `joystream` Github org access and see if it works for the DAO. We should have a decision by the end of the term.
> 

It was tested and used for a bunch of things, including tools written by BWG workers and BWG project board. It is cumbersome at times to work with because of limited permissions from JSG but we can live with those I think and it’s convenient to have all the projects in one org.

> Carried over from the last term: Prepare up-to-date and publicly-accessible list of all the different tools used by the DAO, like jscan, joyutils or council report script. For all of those tools I’d like to write down the maintainer, whether it incurs any costs, URL, etc. Based on this research, some kind of tool compensation plan may be presented to the council.
> 

Kind of related to that, I did cleanup of tools hosted by different workers (some former) - you can find more details in BWG Term 25 report ([https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/15?post=5780](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/15?post=5780), 1st item in `4. Other`). I don’t think any compensation plan is needed as most projects are just frontends hosted for free at Vercel and others are hosted by me as lead. I still want to prepare the up to date list though.

> Finalize Dapplooker compensation discussion.
> 

Done, they have agreed to $100/mo. Still need to create a signal proposal.
