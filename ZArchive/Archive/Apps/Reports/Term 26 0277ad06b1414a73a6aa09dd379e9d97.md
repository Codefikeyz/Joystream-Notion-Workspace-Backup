## Term 26 report

### 1. **Group composition**

| Worker ID | Member ID | Member handle | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | 2233 | `klaudiusz` | lead |
| 8 | 2183 | `dapplooker` | tool operator |

Notes:

1. `jsmoon` was fired from gateway operator as the [l1.media](http://l1.media) app has not been working since 2 months. Multiple attempts were made to provide the worker with support, but to no avail. I’m open to re-hiring the worker once the gateway is operating again and we agree on availability standards.

Not done, will have to wait some more. However, I have done improvements to infra operated by me at [`joyutils.org`](http://joyutils.org) domain and added that RPC endpoint to polkadot apps - [https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/10176](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/10176)
