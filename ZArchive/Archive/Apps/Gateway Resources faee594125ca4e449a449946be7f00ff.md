# Gateway Resources

The best resource at the moment for running your own Gateway is the Atlas operator guide: 

[atlas/operator-guide.md at master · Joystream/atlas](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/blob/master/docs/operator-guide.md)

This gives an overview of most of technical aspects of hosting Atlas, Orion and any other associated services.

Please reach out on #apps Discord channel with anything that’s unclear. Over time, answers to those questions will appear here or will be added to the guide above.
