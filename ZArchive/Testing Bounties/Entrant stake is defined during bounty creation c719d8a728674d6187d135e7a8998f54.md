# Entrant stake is defined during bounty creation

Actual Result: Right now we have a pre-defined input on work entrant modal, which is equal to minimum work entrant stake entry.
Comment: ❓ Right now we have a pre-defined minimum value. What is rationale for worker to enter higher amount to stake? Will Oracle base judgement on staking amoun that worker puts? Is this impacting slashing?
Expected Result: Minimum entrant stake validation applies to member entering Work Entry
