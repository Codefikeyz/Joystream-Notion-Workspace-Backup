### CRT campaign

- Channels:
    - Ambassadors ← most efficient
        - low cost
        - high content quality
        - low awareness
    - Crypto KOLs
        - high awareness, fast
        - high cost ([example](https://www.notion.so/4be574d365274d9582d004aa1bd9cd0b?pvs=21))
    - non-crypto KOLs
        - highest awareness
        - moderate cost
        - non-crypto audience = they will not buy JOY
    - digital marketing
        - x
        - google
        - meta
    - PRs (web3 outlets)
        - high awareness
        - high cost
        - SEO boost - more backlinks for JS&Gleev
