# Imagine: Niche Community, Global Reach

Format: Short vignette video (60-90 secs)
Style: Faux documentary spotlighting passionate niche

## Premise

Spotlight an incredibly passionate micro-community united around an obscure hobby/interest. Show how their niche videos get little traction on mega-platforms.

Transition to them leveraging Joystream tools like creator tokens to directly monetize from their base and collectively fund production of more niche content.

Finish with a vision of them hosting massive in-person events, enabled by web3 facilitating global reach for even tiny sub-cultures.

# Concept

### Opening

We open with visuals highlighting a quirky, niche community that has an incredibly passionate global fanbase despite being centered around an obscure hobby or interest. A few potential examples:

- A group of airsoft/milsim enthusiasts who love meticulous historical re-enactments
- Hardcore anime figure collectors with an obsession for specific character lines
- Enthusiasts dedicated to an ultra-niche video game or sporting subculture

The visuals show snippets of their content - handheld footage from airsoft battles in the woods, figure unboxing videos, talk shows discussing niche lore/history etc. What's established is how passionate and committed this community is, yet the content struggles for views/traction on larger platforms.

### Struggle on Mega-Platforms

We'd then contrast these scattered content creators' experiences on mega-platforms like YouTube. Emphasize how their micro-niche gets completely drowned out by the algorithms and economics favoring more mainstream content.

Visuals could show their videos stuck with single or double-digit views despite the clearly high production quality and passion behind them.

### Discovering Joystream

Cut to one of the community's most prominent creators discovering Joystream. Show their eyes lighting up as they realize the potential.

We visualize them learning about creator tokens through motion graphics or a mock mobile experience. Display stats on how they could earn x% of all token value from their rabid micro-community.

### Activating their Base

Build excitement as the creator starts activating their base and evangelizing Joystream's tools - selling creator tokens to superfans, launching unique NFT collectibles etc.

This segments visually could blend animation with physical product/IRL content creation segments to make it feel tangible.

### Funding their Passion

Project forward to the niche collective using their newfound funding to take their passion to new heights. Premiere live events, creator-owned content channels, exclusive merchandise/experiences only they could dream up.

Ending on a grand vision of this tiny but undyingly passionate sub-culture now having a global stage and monetization engine to thrive, all enabled by Joystream for niche communities.
