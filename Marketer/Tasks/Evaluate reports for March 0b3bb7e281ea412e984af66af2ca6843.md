| cryptogrit | March | - Added Joystream to my YouTube profile page, I intend to add it in at least 50% of my videos in the future (https://prnt.sc/aWHpntVZtsNd)- Made a video about Joystream ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGsMrpgUSgo )- Commented on the last video on your YouTube and liked the last few videos - I am changing the whole description of all my videos soon, so I'll add the Gleev URL ^^- Added Joystream to cover photo on Twitter (i might add it in the description as well (https://prnt.sc/0aj_N8CAkvrg)- Shared the Ambassador Announcement post, commented on a few, and liked pretty much everything you posted in the last month)- I manage one more ACC called Afluencer so I liked everything from there (I am not allowed to share or retweet there)- Subscribed to all other Ambassadors on both Twitter and YouTube, and liked some of their posts, and I commented few videos as well - I shared info about Gleev and Joystream within a few different Balkan Communities so we should have more YouTubers from Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia, joining the program (some of them might not use my reff link...)- Participated in the call regarding Beta Testing Creator Token with Dimitri :) | j4To6jgKfy8MgiMRDXzc15ggN8AnFBgPcuKQZyTm17yNdragV | Firstly, I would hold one call per month where we would discuss what can we do to help with the growth, that's probably the key thing at the start to arrange ^^ | 3 | 666 |
