# Imagine: Owning Your Gaming Universe

Format: Short cinematic video (60-90 secs)
Style: Stylized visuals blending live-action and animation

## Premise

Open on a popular gaming YouTuber, let's call him "GamesEnjoyer", showcasing his latest epic video game playthrough on his channel. Dazzling graphics and millions of views are rolling in, reinforcing his status as a gaming influencer titan.

But then a dark, ominous figure representing the video platform emerges (could be visualized as a menacing corporate entity or just the platform's logo given a sinister persona). It lays down oppressive rules about what GamesEnjoyer can and can't do - enforcing revenue share terms, content moderation policies, algorithm prioritization etc. Despite his success, it's clear he doesn't truly own this gaming universe he's built.

Cue the transition to GamesEnjoyer discovering Joystream's decentralized platform. We'd visualize this through him powering up a sleek device or downloading an app that symbolizes the openness and community-ownership Joystream enables.

GamesEnjoyer then gets a vision/glimpse into the future gaming verse he could build utterly unshackled from corporate overlords. This vision could blend high-quality animation with glossy live-action GamesEnjoyer segments:

He's shown minting his own Creator Token that allows his most passionate fans to invest and own a piece of his universe. Legions of fans receive Creator Token incentives and rewards based on his growth and success.

GamesEnjoyer auctions limited edition video NFTs of his most legendary live streams and gaming moments - these scarce NFTs become valuable collectibles.

His Creator Token and NFT sales fund future game development, so he can launch entirely new video game IP collaboratively built by and for his community.

The community directly votes to customize future games in the GamesEnjoyer universe through Joystream DAO governance model. No more overbearing corporate mandates.

The vignette climaxes with a stunning visual of this vibrant, boundless gaming verse thriving on the Joystream platform. Legions of fans cheering in physical and virtual arenas. Celebrating GamesEnjoyer gaming championships. Making the whole thing feel epic and potentially even bigger than traditional gaming titans.
