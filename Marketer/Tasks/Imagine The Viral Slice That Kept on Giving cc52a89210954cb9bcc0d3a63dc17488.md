# Imagine: The Viral Slice That Kept on Giving

Format: Short narrative video (60-90 secs)

Style: Faux documentary/interview style

## Premise

Interview with a hypothetical creator who went viral years ago for an iconic video clip. Despite generating billions of views, they made very little from the meme.

Cut to them discovering Joystream and minting that viral clip as a one-of-one NFT which sells for a huge sum. Better yet, they get perpetual royalties anytime someone sell that clip as NFT.

Finish with them living their passion project dream enabled by monetizing their viral legacy on Joystream's decentralized platform.

### Opening

We open on visuals portraying one of the internet's most legendary viral videos. Maybe it's the "Charlie Bit My Finger" clip, the "David After Dentist" video, or another iconic meme that generated billions of views across platforms.

As we see clips and stats highlighting its massive virality, the tone is one of amazement at how this small, unassuming piece of content utterly blew up into a global phenomenon.

### The Issuer's Lament

Cut to an interview setting with the person who originally issued this viral video onto the internet, let's call them the "Viral Video Originator" or VVO.

In a mock documentary-style interview, the VVO laments how despite all the billions of views anduso bagsetuse of their viral clip, they actually saw very little of the financial upside.

Emphasize the disillusioning nature of corporations and platforms reaping the monetary benefits of individual internet culture instead of the actual creators.

### The Joystream Epiphany

The VVO then recounts their mindset shifting after discovering Joystream. Show them learning about the tokenization and ownership models baked into the platform.

We visualize the ideation process as the VVO conceives of minting their viral video clip as a one-of-one NFT to auction off and commercialize their legacy.

### Cashing In

Transition to the VVO creating buzz and demand around this ultra-exclusive NFT drop of their iconic viral clip. Build anticipation as an auction teaser campaign generates hype across social platforms.

Climax with visuals of the NFT auction in progress as bids pour in from fans, collectors, investors and big buyers trying to own this piece of internet history.

Pop in graphics showing the VVO's jaw dropping as the winning NFT auction bid hits a multi-million dollar sum they never could have fathomed.

### The Royalties Forever

As an added bonus, educate how the VVO will also receive perpetual royalties anytime their viral clip NFT gets re-sold, referenced or commercialized in any way thanks to Joystream's decentralized ownership models.

End on the VVO being able to pursue their creative ambitions full-time, all enabled by finally monetizing their inadvertent creation of one of the internet's most culturally ubiquitous memes.
