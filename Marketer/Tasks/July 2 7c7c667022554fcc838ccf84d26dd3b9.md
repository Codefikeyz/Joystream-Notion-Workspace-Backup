|  | **Suggested OKRs for Q3'24** | **Leetjoy** | **Dmtr** | 0x2bc comment following Leet's and Dmtr's inputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **O2** |  | **(NEW) MAU and DAU to increase by 30%** |  |  |
| **KR** |  | (NEW)  MWG campaigns drove not less than 20% of new users and 10% of new creators to Joystream apps on average. |  | It's not clear where the rest 80%=(100%-20%) of the users come from if not from market activities. Are they referrals from existing users or from organic search? |
| **KR** |  | (NEW) Launch a targeted marketing campaign aimed at attracting developers to build on Joystream resulting in the launch of at least 1 new app by the end of the quarter. |  | The launch of the new app heavily depends on builder support, DAO sponsorship, and other factors that MWG can't really influence.Instead, I suggest using funnels with specific values, showing how many "developers" are reached out to (cold leads), how many of them are interested, and so on, following the funnel process. |
