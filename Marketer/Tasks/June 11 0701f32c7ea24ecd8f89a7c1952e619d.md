## Ambassador Program

Good progress. We have high involvement from our ambassadors, and the amount of content created is increasing every day. There is high interest in the program from content creators, and MWG is carefully checking every single applicant, their social media, and content quality, and inviting the most promising individuals to join our program. MWG will prepare a Q2 evaluation of the program and its impact at the end of Q2.

Phase 2 stats:

315 applicants filled application form in Term 33;

35 applicants were invited to the program;

key quality for approved applicants:

- strong content creation skills
- if not video creator, tweetscore > 100 & good content quality
- diverse geo

Based on ambassador reports, the impact of their work, and the quality of their content, MWG will be excluding ambassadors who do not deliver value to the project from the program.
