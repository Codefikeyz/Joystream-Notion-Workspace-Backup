|  | **Suggested OKRs for Q3'24** | **Leetjoy** | **Dmtr** | 0x2bc comment following Leet's and Dmtr's inputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **O1:** | **Drastically increase awareness of Joystream. Solidify its name as inseparable from SocialFi and the Creator Economy** | **(CHANGE) MCAP vs Benchmark group grew by 50% by end of quarter (CMC)** |  |  |
| **KR** | [Achieve a 15% average month-over-month increase in first-time visitors to the Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/) and Gleev.xyz websites, maintaining the conversion rate to the target actions (1) at least as good as it is now | KEEP | Comment: We need to target specific numbers. Even if CR is lower perhaps with some acquisition tactics drawing to broader audiences it will naturally be lower but with cheaper price of advertising the top funnel will be so big that overall sign ups will go up (thats what we want). So I would rephrase towards total conversions and not conversion rate. Also 15% MOM is ambitious. 15% in month 1 and 5% mom thereafter may be more realistic as you cannot constantly improve at that rate. | > Dmtr: I would rephrase towards total conversions and not conversion rateSounds good> Dmtr: 15% MOM is ambitiousWhen we're trying to improve something for the first time (at least we have such KR for the first time) and starting from a low base, a 15% MOM increase shouldn't be too hard to achieve. |
| **KR** | Secure at least one high-profile ambassador (numbers as a benchmark, like CG’s stats: no less than 50k subscribers on YouTube, a track record of 500 videos posted, averaging 20k views per video, with a primary focus on crypto). | REMOVE | One high profile ambassador over the span of 3 months does not sound too ambitions tbh. We can explore higher number but need a way to figure out paying in vested JOY tokens based on performance (milestone-based tranches).  Also 20k views is quite a lot, even 5k would be good. | So far, suggestions 0x2bc: 1 top KOLLeetjoy: exclude KR Dmtr: 3 top KOLs |
| **KR** | Increase Twitter engagement score, measured by VCs subscribed, Influencers, and projects subscribed, by 10% in each category monthly according to the TwitterScout score | KEEP | KEEP |  |
| **KR** | Maintain a weekly updated list of all newly SocialFi and creator economy industry research posted on Twitter and major crypto outlets. Ensure Joystream is mentioned in at least 70% of these. (4) | KEEP | Here I think we need to have a specific list already, without asking to maintain the list in the KRs. So define the list ahead, and try to get to 50% of them including us, while exploring 100% of contacts as per what it takes for us to get featured (commercials may not add up on all of them so ½ is already ambitions without knowing more now). | > Dmtr: So define the list ahead, and try to get to 50% of them including usNot really clear how to do that. |
| **KR** | Maintain a weekly updated list of all upcoming major creator economy and social fi Twitter Spaces. Ensure we participate in at least one of them per week as a speaker. | (CHANGE) Secure at least 1 speaking opportunity per month for Joystream team members at industry events, X spaces, or podcasts | Imo overly ambitious. We want to land 2 per month I'd say and review the frequency once every month. Otherwise our operational resources may be overspent focussing on that one. | So far, suggestions 0x2bc: 4 / monthLeetjoy: 1 / month Dmtr: 2 / month |
| **KR** | Reach out to crypto projects (our wallet providers, exchanges, JSG investors, etc) and ensure at least 5 new per month start using Gleev reguraly. | (CHANGE)  Reach out to crypto projects and ensure at least 3 new per month start using Gleev | Interesting one, I'd like to see it if we can do is to make a list, contact them and just offer promotion on our platform (pinning their videos to top of the page if they sign up and constantly post to Gleev and perhaps post about them doing original uploads to our platform as well on Twitter).This way we can build relationships with them and follow up with marketing campaigns later. So while bringing them onboard at all cost should not be our focus, collecting feedback and building relationship is great! |  |
| **KR** | Develop and maintain a DAO content strategy that plans at least one month ahead of events. | REMOVE | KEEP |  |
| **KR** | Implement tools to measure marketing outcomes, track traffic, and understand coverage (2) | REMOVE | KEEP |  |
| **KR** | Attract 5,000 unique users to the Joystream x Tangem purchase landing page within one month through targeted marketing efforts aimed at the Joystream and general crypto communities. (3) | REMOVE | KEEP |  |
|  | Refer 10,000 people to the Bridge landing page within 1 month of its launch. | REMOVE | KEEP |  |
| **KR** |  | (NEW) Joystream Ambassador Program: at least 40 active ambassadors by the end of Q3 |  | It is not clear who the active ambassadors are, and how this number translates to market cap improvement. More discussions are required |
| **O2** |  | **(NEW) MAU and DAU to increase by 30%** |  |  |
| **KR** |  | (NEW)  MWG campaigns drove not less than 20% of new users and 10% of new creators to Joystream apps on average. |  | It's not clear where the rest 80%=(100%-20%) of the users come from if not from market activities. Are they referrals from existing users or from organic search? |
| **KR** |  | (NEW) Launch a targeted marketing campaign aimed at attracting developers to build on Joystream resulting in the launch of at least 1 new app by the end of the quarter. |  | The launch of the new app heavily depends on builder support, DAO sponsorship, and other factors that MWG can't really influence.Instead, I suggest using funnels with specific values, showing how many "developers" are reached out to (cold leads), how many of them are interested, and so on, following the funnel process. |
