Not sure how difficult it is to build a tool to verify users (*perhaps it's very simple*) [https://docs.farcaster.xyz/auth-kit/hooks/use-sign-in](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/auth-kit/hooks/use-sign-in)

Action items:

- check with the builders on difficulty of implementing such feature on Gleev
- if easy → parse active creators Farcaster usernames
- impelement feature on Gleev to claim airdrop if account has a channel with more than 1 video
- announce on Farcaster, X and Dracula app, cold outreach to top 100 creators informing them of this opportunity
