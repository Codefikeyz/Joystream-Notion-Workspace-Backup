## CRT Campaign Plan

This plan outlines the strategies and tactics for the soft launch campaign aimed at increasing awareness and driving initial adoption of Joystream's new Creator tokens (CRTs) among content creators.

### Objectives

The soft launch campaign will employ a multichannel approach to achieve the following key objectives:

- Increase awareness of Joystream's Creator token among content creators
- Content creation for smooth new creators onboarding (ambassador videos, articles, etc)
- Drive adoption of Creator tokens by both established and emerging creators
- Educate creators on the benefits of launching Creator tokens (revenue sharing, community building, etc.)

### Audiences

To accomplish these goals, the campaign will strategically target three core audiences:

- Established YouTube/social media creators with large, engaged fanbases
- Up-and-coming creators looking for new monetization and community-building tools
- Crypto-native creators already exploring web3 platforms

### Channels

A diverse array of marketing channels and tactics will be employed, each customized to resonate with the respective audience segments. These include:

- **Ambassador Program**
    - Incentivize ambassadors to launch Creator tokens and create educational videos
    - Provide bounties/rewards for high-quality, engaging marketing content
    - WHEN: after CRT is live on Gleev
        - bounty will be available for all active ambassadors
        - reward per ambassador: upto 10,000 JOY (based on content quality)
            - max cap for YT content upto 10,000 JOY
