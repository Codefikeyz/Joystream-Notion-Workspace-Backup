## draft

## **Welcome to the Joystream Ambassadors Program!**

**With this publication, we are launching the second season of our current ambassador program!**

**Joystream is a video platform protocol build on it own L1 blockchain.**

**We allow users to create their own video apps, monetize their creativity and support their favorite creators.**

**We've already launched our first video app with awesome features called Gleev and we want you to discover the benefits of the Joystream ecosystem for all users around the world.** 

**Thats why we aimed our Ambassador program for:**

- **to increase the quality and diversity of content created within the ambassadors' program**
- **to increase the reach of the presence of information about the Joystream project in the mainstream media**
- **to increase the number of web3 followers involved in the project**

**Thats why we filled our Ambassador program with two reward pools consisted in our Joy token!**

## 1) Introduction

Our ambassador program is the place where with your skills and minimal web3 activity you can:

- earn Joy tokens by performing various tasks
- receive ongoing rewards for earning Tiers and roles
- improve your web3 and DAO skills
- interact with hundreds of other participants and the project team

The most exciting part for all participants will be that the pool of Joy tokens rewards for the ambassador program will increase every quarter!                                                                                              

Starting with a total pool of 200k JOY ($5k) in the second quarter of 2024, the pool will increase in the 3rd quarter to 300k JOY and then to 400k JOY tokens in the 4th quarter of 2024!

These rewards will be available to all participants of the ambassador program, both those who are elected as ambassadors and those who do not get the role.
At Joystream, everyone can earn!

## 2) Program Structure & Rewards

The ambassadors' program will consist of two separate blocks.

- quests in Zealy publicly accessible to all

Each block will have its own reward pool and its own unique ranking system.

In the Ambassador program, the following will be identified;

Ambassador needs to earn at least 80 points for 3 consecutive months to advance to Tier 3

And finaly ambassador needs to earn at least 100 points for 4 consecutive months to advance to Tier 4

As well as ambassadors with Tier 1 who do not fulfill the minimum requirements for the month and are demoted from this Tier have a chance to apply for ambassadorship in the next round of recruitment.*
