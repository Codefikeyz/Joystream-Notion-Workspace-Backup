**3. Onboarding plans for newcomers**

We create bounties for content creator and if newcomer complete the bounty and do extra ordinary job greater than existing content creators, then we will allow newcomer to perform their duties in WG and less competent content creator will fire because “content creator” position is testing role for newcomers.

**4. Group Priorities for the Term**

**Content Creation**

1. We will make announcement of carthage on our [MWG medium account](https://medium.com/@joystream.dao).
2. We will make tutorial on “how to check rationale of proposals' votes?” 

**Research and Analysis**

1. We will make research and find out most effective and interesting micro activities which can use for engaging community unexcited days. 
2. We are making research 

**Outreach and Brand awareness**

We will continue working on reddit and twitter for purpose of brand awareness.

We will write about carthage testnet on following forums: [**https://joystream.notion.site/List-of-forums-for-public-awareness-6db50572ecfe456785b742a5ba712174**](../Our%20achievement/Research%20and%20analysis%20center/List%20of%20forums%20for%20public%20awareness%206db50572ecfe456785b742a5ba712174.md)

**Handbook Improvement**

We will locate flaws in system and testnet handbook, and will propose its solutions in details.

**Recruiting**

We are following this [**sheet**](https://www.notion.so/Vacant-Seats-in-groups-f9412d3da2974f96824e957ff74e98d5?pvs=21) updated by HR working group, if working group will need newcomers, they will update the sheet and we will outreach leads of respective working groups and will start recruitment process.

Following sheet suggest that distributors need “deputy lead”, this is misunderstanding between HR and distributor WG, I have pointed it out. Sheet needs to update in this regard.

Following sheet suggest that content curator’s WG is looking for interns, most suitable recruits will be users who didn’t achieve FM threshold yet, for this internship, we are recruiting them each term because curator’s WG hire 3 new interns each term.

Following sheet suggest that storage WG need “deputy lead”, we recruited a newcomer from inside the working group and connected with lead. Newcomer has applied for position, but lead is convinced to hire deputy in new testnet.

Following sheet suggests that builders are looking for team players, we found some recruits but they couldn’t bear test tasks. 

**Mainnet Strategy**

We are working on Go-to-Market strategy and on our long-term approach inside working group. We are making research on launchpads which can potentially use for launch of $JOY token. 

**Ecosystem**

We are working with jsg who will possibly first gateway provider in our ecosystem and they showed their intention to build web3 focused video sharing platform on joystream blockchain. We are finding content creators which will use to generate the leads when jsg will launch its video application “Gleev”.
