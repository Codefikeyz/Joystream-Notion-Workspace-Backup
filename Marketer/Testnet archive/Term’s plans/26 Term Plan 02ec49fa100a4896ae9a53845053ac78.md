### **Onboarding plans for newcomers**

1. We planned to hire a strategic advisor (former jsg cmo), he showed interest to join us. Starting salary is 800k tJOY.
2. We planned to hire a potential content creator. She already applied. starting salary is 500k tJOY.

Imp Note: In previous term, we used 7.269 MtJOY in worker’s rewards and 1.520 MtJOY in lead’s rewards. So total, budget spent was **8.789 MtJOY.** I planned to increase 200k tJOY salary of 2 existing marketers. Newcomers also will get hired and will start their work on sunday. Salaries will update on 8:00 am CET on CLI. I am telling this so council can plan budget allocation accordingly.
