**3. Onboarding plans for newcomers**

We create bounties for content creator and if newcomer complete the bounty and do extra ordinary job greater than existing content creators, then we will allow newcomer to perform their duties in WG and less competent content creator will fire because “content creator” position is testing role for newcomers.

**4. Group Priorities for the Term**

**Content Creation**

1. We are closely analyzing issues and confusions of community in carthage and have many different topics to make tutorials for community.

**Research and Analysis**

1. We are researching on selected launchpad for making launch easier and smooth. 

**Outreach and Brand awareness**

1. We will continue working on reddit and twitter for purpose of brand awareness.
2. We will write about carthage testnet on following forums: [**https://joystream.notion.site/List-of-forums-for-public-awareness-6db50572ecfe456785b742a5ba712174**](../Our%20achievement/Research%20and%20analysis%20center/List%20of%20forums%20for%20public%20awareness%206db50572ecfe456785b742a5ba712174.md)

**Handbook Improvement**

We will locate flaws in system and testnet handbook, and will propose its solutions in details.

**Recruiting**

We were following this [**sheet**](https://www.notion.so/Vacant-Seats-in-groups-f9412d3da2974f96824e957ff74e98d5?pvs=21) operated by HR working group, but it is not updating properly, so we are following working groups open positions on pioneer. In this term, pioneer isn’t able to create new memberships that’s why MWG will only keep previous recruits on board and we will help them to understand their work and the platform. 

We are actively working to fill these positions: 

1. RUST Developers - BWG
2. FRONT-END Developers - BWG
3. Product Designers - BWG

**Mainnet Strategy**

We are working on Go-to-Market strategy and on our long-term approach inside working group. We selected a launchpad for suggesting jsgenesis to consider for mainnet launch, we will send our proposal to jsgenesis in this term. 

**Ecosystem**

We are working with jsg who will possibly first gateway provider in our ecosystem and they showed their intention to build web3 focused video sharing platform on joystream blockchain. We are finding content creators which will use to generate the leads when jsg will launch its video application “Gleev”.
