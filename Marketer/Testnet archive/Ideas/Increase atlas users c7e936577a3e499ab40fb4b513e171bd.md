Info: I propose to make a contest between users, you need to make a quality video and upload it to YouTube, tell about Joystream, about the future of the project, why it is profitable to use this platform to distribute your content, then choose the top 5 contestants and share awards between them, I think we will be able to tear a piece of users from youtube
