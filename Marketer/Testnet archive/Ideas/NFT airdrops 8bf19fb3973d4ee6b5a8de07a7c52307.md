# Rationale

Everyone loves to receive free NFT. 

How about first NFT’s on Decentralized media platform DAO? 🚀

# Scope of work

1. Come up with creative videos to be introduced to other communities. Theme for those content may vary. It could be content made inside of target community (ex. year awards celebration) or made by marketing wg.
2. Mint this video as NFT in Joystream in required for airdrop quantity.
3. Assigned workers distribute this “airdrop” NFT to active participants from those communities (example ECO.org layer2 members). 

# Scoring

To measure the outcome we can rely on some data

- quality of content
- the number of minted NFT’s
- the number of claimed NFT’s
- conversion number (how many people who claimed NFT created member handle or channel in Atlas)
- awareness reach of the event (could be hard to measure)
