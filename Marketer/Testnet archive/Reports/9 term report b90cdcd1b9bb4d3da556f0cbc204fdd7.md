According to the [Term 9 plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=3433)

## YPP

At the end of this term, [Gleev.xyz](http://Gleev.xyz) app was verified by YouTube!

**Content creators onboarding**

During this term, several contacts were made with content creators, however, due to a warning screen from YouTube on YPP sign-up marketing working group did not prioritize this task. 
At the end of the term Gleev.xyz was [verified](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035125759687266364/1101420253478666320) and we are looking forward to making contacts with creators a priority for newly hired workers during term 10.

Verifying who referred whom manually at scale is a tough task. To solve this issue, during the next term, the referral system will be presented to the DAO council. The main aim of this system is to encourage the community to promote YPP and earn JOY.

**Research on content creators**

Not enough data was collected to attach to the report. 

**Research on crypto projects and communities**

Work in progress, 213 projects were added to the [database](https://www.notion.so/22f0eff1959b4a4cadd6a8e8171274c3?pvs=21).

**Welcoming joined content creators on Twitter**

Will be done next term due to a limited channels count.

**Cross-promotion and small-time collaborations with creators**

To produce high-impact organic content made by actual Joystream adopters, the marketing working group will prioritize the task of contacting creators who joined YPP in order to execute varieties of cross-promotions and other initiatives.
Several contacts were made during this term 9, and the potential outcomes of these contacts will be included in the upcoming reports.

## Zealy Campaign

The marketing working group had a heavy workload during this term while reviewing the winners of the second sprint. All entries were assessed, and 92.5% of the second sprint budget was awarded to participants. The group is still collecting correct wallet addresses from participants who had submitted the wrong ones (e.g. ERC, TRC addresses), and payments to these addresses will be distributed by the end of term 10.

During this term third sprint was launched and announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/status/1648690543759851521), [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/326624845/?p=profile), [Telegram](https://t.me/JoystreamANN/66), and Discord.

**Event details**

- Timeline: April, 20 - May, 22
- JOY to be allocated among participants: [400K JOY](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/269)
- Who is eligible for JOY rewards: everyone based on earned XP

**Analyze the second sprint outcome**

At the time of this report, the full quests .csv file could not be exported on Zealy. Once their service is available, we will export the file. During the second sprint marketing working group collected necessary data, and feedback from participants and the community to enhance the third sprint.

The second sprint report will be released once we are able to export all quests from Zealy. 
The table below presents a brief summary of the community's growth.

| No. | Beginning of sprint | End of sprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discord | 4475 | 4910 |

Despite a significant decrease in the level of involvement compared to the first sprint, the outcomes appear to be adequate.

## Research

**Research on collaborations**

The [database](https://www.notion.so/22f0eff1959b4a4cadd6a8e8171274c3?pvs=21) was created and partly filled with potential crypto and NFT projects for cross-promotion.

**Research/analysis of the Bitcointalk campaign's effectiveness**

Work in progress, this task was not a priority during this term.

## Joy token listing preparations

Work in progress. A dedicated notion [page](https://www.notion.so/JOY-Listing-24b861dce3894302b4f5b4a020585680?pvs=21) was made to track listing activities.

## SMM updates

Joystream DAO's Twitter feed and Telegram announcement channel have been consistently [updated](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/with_replies) with new content. 

## Notion updates

Marketers’ notion is being improved and updated. Looking forward to Council recommendations on how to improve it further.

## Research on opportunities to increase our social metrics and overall activity on Telegram, Discord, and Twitter

To improve the quality and engagement of conversations in Discord a Discord-Tip-Bot was [developed](https://github.com/Joystream/discord-bot/pull/4), which enables JOY transfer within the Discord server. Functionality was tested and sent to JSG review in order to add it to the Joystream Discord server.

To improve the quality of content posted on Telegram marketing working group [proposed](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/276) to the council adding Combot to the Telegram chat. 

The main feature of Combot is its Anti-Spam system that will ban users even before they post spam messages.

> CAS stands for Combot Anti-Spam, an automated system designed to detect spammers in Telegram groups. If a user with any spam record connects to a CAS-secured group, the CAS system will ban that user immediately.
