### Term OKRs Score

![Untitled](8%20term%20report/Untitled%201.png)

The total term 8 score is - **0.731**

This was calculated assuming that each objective has the same weight in total scoring. The hardest objective to accomplish was the promotion of Telegram chat and having better results here will lead to a significant increase in total scoring.
