**Hire additional workers to enhance the capacity of the working group.**

Two workers were hired in Term 29, and we are in the process of onboarding two more workers in the next term.

**Create content highlighting the features of the NARA runtime upgrade and the Creator Token.**

Robert agreed to create a Creator onboarding video for CRT.

The video will be professionally edited, showcasing parts of the CRT Gleev flow and explaining the concepts and features of CRTs, namely:

- Concept of CRT / benefits for creators / benefits for community (buyers)
- Feature of customising CRT page
- Feature of Setting patronage for the channel

Other content related to CRT and Nara is being worked on.

**Support product launces & events**

In this term, the MWG lead gained access to Mailchimp, which was used by JSG to send emails to the subscriber list. We sent the first email for the OneKey hardware wallet, but some users reported that the email appeared in spam. We will investigate the reason behind this issue and plan to use this tool more frequently for email campaigns.

Reviewed/Provided feedback on the Joystream Dashboard and began working on blog posts and announcements.

For the validator dashboard, it was decided to postpone announcements since not all validators were verified.

**Create a community-driven campaign for content creation, including infographics and memes**

Due to the high workload, this task was postponed to Term 30. Kudos to YYAGI for reminding us and bringing it up.

**KR-4.5 [Marketing] Onboard 10 Marketing Ambassadors**

The Ambassador program was promoted outside of Joystream in some crypto communities. We also submitted a few applications to add this program to niche websites. We conducted a thorough screening of all applications and selected the best six suitable ambassadors who will be invited to join the program.

**KR-4.4 [Marketing] Reach 32,000 non-empty channels and 1,400,000 non-spam videos on Joystream by the end of Q1**

**Execute a video production and publishing campaign that highlights the YPP program on popular YouTube channels, aimed at boosting creator growth.**

We were in communication with several creators; however, we did not reach the goal of utilizing the allocated 95K JOY for this campaign due to some communication lag with creators. We will use the remaining 40K JOY in the next term.

**KR-4.3 [Marketing] At least 3 new interviews with Joystream team are conducted and published**

**Reach out to potential KOLs who will be hosting AMA sessions with JoyStream**

WIP.

**Upload the existing interview on YouTube and start an advertising campaign**

[Uploaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZZUyT402c&t=9s&ab_channel=Joystream). For ads, we decided to wait for the DAO to establish a process for paying for web2 services to maintain orderly accounting. A proposal for this process was submitted and approved this term.

**KR-4.2 [Marketing] At least 25 new Joystream-related review videos targeted at crypto audiences are posted on Youtube**

**Outreach to crypto creators**

WIP.

**KR-4.1 [Marketing] Joystream is listed on at least 2 more CEX:** Achieve social media metrics required for exchange listing, Execute listing with DAO provided funds

This key result was achieved; however, we are keeping a close eye on any opportunities for JOY to get listed on reputable exchanges and responding to every listing proposal.

### Council tasks

**Implement the Council's proposed reorganisation model for the WG.**

WIP.

**Manage ongoing tasks within the Lead's scope of responsibility.**

WIP.

**Market-making: provide 7k USD liquidity via Hummingbot according to the terms specified by the Council - help council with liquidity provision task and implementaion of Liquidity Process**

[Reporting thread](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/816). There was a setback when the MEXC connector broke. This issue was fixed in the 1.26 release on Monday, the 27th, and we resumed operations.

**Implement of tracking of marketing efficiency**

1. For tracking campaigns targeting creator growth, we have the necessary tracking tools provided by the Content Working Group. Using HubSpot exports, we can track referral counts resulting from executing campaigns with prominent creators.
2. In this term, we gained access to Google Analytics for the Gleev app, which will be used to enhance tracking.

**Come up with a campaign calendar for each marketing channel**

Due to the short period of time (one week) given to complete the campaign calendar after the council plan was approved in Term 29, it is still being worked on, and the draft version will be presented internally to the council.

Here is the list of marketing channels that we plan/consider to use for upcoming campaigns:

## Extra Items

**Coingecko update**

Submit tickets to new exchanges

**CMC communities campaign**

Significant effort was put into the Coinmarketcap Communities campaign this term, with the main objective being to increase platform awareness on CMC by utilizing Joystream's content library.

We conducted many hours of testing on platform algorithms and researched high-quality crypto videos uploaded to Gleev, achieving solid results in this direction.

[For example some posts reached 50K+ views](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/spatsochi85_egchhu/). We also reviewed the views on Gleev itself for posted videos and confirmed that people are actually joining Gleev to view those videos.

We believe that this is an extremely cost-efficient marketing strategy that can boost overall Joystream awareness within the crypto community. As we all agree that the crypto community and investors are the primary target audience that MWG should focus on reaching, we will continue to improve the reach and scale of these efforts.

**Fireside chat highlights (create videos for X)**

Created/posted a few clips.

**Bitcointalk thread**

Created/posted a [Joystream thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5486276.msg63722756#msg63722756) on Bitcointalk (added this to our pool for socials that need to be updated)

**Reddit ressurection**

Got moderation access to the [Joystream Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/joystream_dao/) and began updating it with content.

**More hardware wallets**

[Submit a proposal](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/806) for creation of co-branded wallets with Tangem

**Marketing research & proposals**

Research on new market trends, narratives that might apply to our platform (DePin, Progressive Ownership, etc) and how we can get the most out of it.

marat_mu conducted [research on additional platforms to introduce Joystream](https://www.notion.so/fd7829a28af44fe096f7a66b051a52e1?pvs=21). We will be adding some of them to the WG scope.

There were several marketing proposals in this term, such as the proposal from Spark Protocol to add JoyStream to isolated assets on Spark Protocol ([https://docs.spark.fi/](https://docs.spark.fi/)), among others.

**Joystream MWG Twitter account ressurection**

We submitted a ticket and provided Twitter with detailed information explaining why these profile was following platform rules. We are looking forward to getting them unsuspended.
