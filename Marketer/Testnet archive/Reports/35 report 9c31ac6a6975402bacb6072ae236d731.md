## **3. Group Tasks**

**Execute initiatives linked to Q3 OKRs**

- progress on outreach to crypto projects ( we have received designs from JSG how partners projects will be presented on Gleev app and are using it with outreach to convince big projects to join us and spread a word about platform)
- progress on X spaces - part of joystream team participated on external [twitter spaces](https://x.com/Bullseye4Crypto/status/1816098034826015040), it was a trial for our new spaces host
- mwg started work on researching niche overview reports where Joystream is not included, in case of author of blog or twitter thread forgot to add us - we inform them about Joystream existence

[**Ambassador program](https://www.notion.so/Ambassador-Program-9624e4d2c766463a8ae8bf1cfe9792c7?pvs=21) promotion / management**

Spending breakdown since program launch (February 12, 2024)

Term 30: 35250 JOY
Term 31: 116708 JOY
Term 32: 360740 JOY
Term 33: 88680 JOY
Term 34: 252260 JOY
Term 35: 274782,5 JOY

Total: **1,128,420.5 JOY** (this includes regular monthly ambassador rewards and bounties they completed)

Our ambassadors provide authentic, localized engagement at scale, our team ensures quality, giving immediate feedback and excluding underperformers without pay
our ambassadors program is a scalable, high-impact network with potential to become self-sustainable and separate from MWG (we're actively working towards this)

Ambassador reports are timely evaluated and rewards sent;

We launched bounty for ambassadors - engaging with new CRT marketplace, buy tokens, make video content about it, etc;

Ambassadors were offered 25% increased reward if they apply 1 year vesting on their monthly reward or if they will receive ambassador rewards on their revenue channel with active CRT, some ambassadors chosen this options;

Overall, mwg team is happy with the program performance and direction.
