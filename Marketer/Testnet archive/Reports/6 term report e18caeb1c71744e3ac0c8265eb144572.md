## **Work status for the Term**

According to the [Term 6 plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=1266)

### **Hackathon preparations**

We did not achieve our key result and nor finalized plan was published or approved by the Council due to a lack of time dedicated to this task. I thank @Chaos77 for his input.

**LBRY**

LBRY [database](https://www.notion.so/f34ed2aa26c64def82b4935860584945?pvs=21) was updated and some categories (Finance, Tech, Gaming, Education) were filled with data. The marketing working group was not able to finalize this task due to YouTube limitations (5 contact grabs per day) and a large amount of work on Crew3.

**Cryptocurrency niche**

Work in progress, channels being added to [database 1](https://www.notion.so/Popular-Crypto-Channels-Database-9d7a8e8e3d8b41bfb9a3aba3b8ee1b38?pvs=21) and [database 2](https://www.notion.so/644fc286cbcc4089abe2ec5df1724ce9?pvs=21) however marketing working group did not put much effort into this task this term.

**YPP testing and providing feedback**

The marketing working group had a first look into YPP on @bedeho's open doors stream. Looking forward to getting our hands on this task in term 7.

**Drafting initial email templates for contacting content creators**

Initial templates were prepared and added to the dedicated [notion](https://www.notion.so/Email-templates-2f10efb23fff497b970c40da9b72f2a7?pvs=21) page.
