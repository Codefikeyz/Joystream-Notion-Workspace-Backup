# **Work status for the Term**

### **Present the Crew 3 questboard to Council and request funding.**

Promo was presented in the [pre-proposal discussion,](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/74) followed by [proposal 92](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/92) that was expired, since the Council were not able to come to a consensus on that proposal due to missing general plan, but given that @0x2bc and @Jen4ph voted approve and @l1dev left a [comment](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/92?post=112):

> this can be spent from the group budget at your discretion
> 

The lead decides to save 25000 JOY for this activity from the WG budget refilled in [proposal 89](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/89).
