**WG Budget:**

| Item | USDT | JOY | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Additional Hires | 1,320 | 60,000 | see the planned openings; 60K JOY is a rough estimate, funds might be used to pay the salaries of hired workers |
| Lead salary | 3,600 | 163,636 | 2y vesting |
| Creator growth campaign | 2,970 | 135,000 | 40k unsused from Term 29 due to communication lag with creators, I suggest allocating 95k more JOY for this activity in Term 30 |
| Marketers salary (marat_mu and spat_sochi) | 832 | 37,843 | The base salary for 2 marketers is 18,921. I would like to have an allowance to reward their extra contributions based on outcomes. |
| Ambassadors rewards | 990 | 45,000 | Given that they will start with a lower tier, the monthly rewards will be at low levels. It is recommended to increase the budget and create unique bounties for ambassadors. |
| Total Spending | 9,712 | 441,479 | Max spending if required workers hired, all creator growth collabs were executed, marketers worked at max expected performance and ambassadors completed bounties given to them. 163.6K from this amount will be sent to lead account with 2 years vesting. |
