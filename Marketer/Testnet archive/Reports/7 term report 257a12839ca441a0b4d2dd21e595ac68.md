**Hanzo** hired at block ****[1,575,780](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc.joystream.org:9944/ws-rpc#/explorer/query/1575780) Date: 29/03/2023

## **Budget for the Term**

- Planned budget: **89K** JOY
- Actual budget: **448K** JOY
- Refilled budget: **448K** JOY refilled in proposals [209](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/209) (400K Crew3 Second Sprint Budget) and [224](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/224) (48K for working group salaries)
- 400000 JOY was reserved for Crew3 payouts for the second spring of the campaign;

We took the initiative of reserving the budget upfront so we have set an exact amount of JOY to be distributed among Crew3 second sprint participants that will be up until 20 April. This budget was approved by the Council.

## **Work status for the Term**

According to the [Term 7 plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=1437)

### **Hackathon preparations**

We did not achieve our key result and nor finalized plan was published or approved by the Council due to lack of time. A dedicated [Github](https://github.com/traumschule/community-repo/tree/events/events) was created by @l1dev. The final set of hackathon tasks and budget was not set yet.

### **YPP launch preparations**

During this term, the YPP program was tested by the community and successfully [launched](https://twitter.com/JoystreamDAO/status/1638561964405276680). Joystream has accomplished a major milestone, and now the marketing team is fully equipped to contact numerous content creators. We have collected a few databases of popular YouTube channels in the crypto niche (blockchain, NFT, P2E, web3, etc) and the most active channels that have shown activity on the LBRY platform and prepared draft [email templates](https://www.notion.so/Email-templates-2f10efb23fff497b970c40da9b72f2a7?pvs=21) for contacting creators.

**LBRY**

LBRY [database](https://www.notion.so/f34ed2aa26c64def82b4935860584945?pvs=21) was updated and some categories were filled with data. The marketing working group completed this task and is ready to contact the gathered content creators.

**YPP testing and providing feedback**

The marketing working group had a first look at YPP and everything seems to be good to go, however, due to a YouTube warning that appears upon connecting [Gleev.xyz](http://Gleev.xyz) app the actual mass advertising of the YPP program cannot be sufficient as of the moment. 

### **Crew3 campaign**

During this term marketing working group successfully launched the second sprint on the Crew3 platform. This event was [announced](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/status/1638829897434169345) on multiple community channels such as Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. 

**Event details:**

- Timeline: 23 March - 20 April
- JOY to be allocated among participants: [400K JOY](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/209)
- Who is eligible for JOY rewards: everyone based on earned XP

**Analyze the first sprint outcome**

Analytics was completed to improve the outputs of the second sprint. 

**Second sprint design completed**

The main change that was applied is that now everyone who participates will get JOY rewards based on earned XP. We also added several new quests and adjusted XP to make the compensation model fair to all participants and increase campaign performance.

**Review Crew3 premium plans, and schedule a call with Crew3 regarding premium plans**

Premium plans were reviewed and the decision was made not to utilize them in our second sprint. It will make sense to use only their most expensive Premium plan which will cost 3000$/month that includes announcing our event on Crew3 social media channels, but the cost for the DAO is considered too high and these funds can be utilized for marketing to get better outcomes.

**Finalize the budget for the second sprint with the DAO Council**

The budget of 400K JOY was finalized, approved by the Council, and [refilled](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/209) to the working group treasury.

**Promotion outside JS**

The event was [promoted](https://t.me/whitelist1/4103) on various Telegram channels. This has a significant impact on our positioning at the top among all projects on the Crew3 platform. We started our sprint being in the top 1050 but at the end of the term, our rank is already top 67.

### **Content creation**

**Create content for social media posts and forum announcements/updates**

The marketing working group has been actively generating and [posting](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg) content on Twitter and Telegram announcement channels.

**Create illustration assets in Joystream branding that can be utilized by DAO (e.g. marketing purposes)**

As part of term 7, the marketing working group designed multiple assets in the Joystream brand style, such as illustrations, graphics for Twitter posts, and SMM background templates. While these have yet to be uploaded online, we seek the Council's input on where to store them.

### **Research**

**Research on social media platforms, communities, and forums where we can introduce Joystream.**

Ongoing research is being utilized by the lead to promote the Crew3 campaign and introduce Joystream to different communities and platforms. However, due to the possibility of malicious use, the outcomes of the research will be kept confidential.

**Continue on with marketing strategy development and gateway onboarding program**

Our marketing strategy is evolving as we conduct ongoing research, with a new plan set to be published in Q2.

**Research/analysis of the Bitcointalk campaign's effectiveness**

Due to insufficient data and a high load during term 7, the task is being postponed to the next Council term.

### **Joy token listing preparations**

Work in progress. A dedicated notion [page](https://www.notion.so/JOY-Listing-24b861dce3894302b4f5b4a020585680?pvs=21) was made to track listing activities.

### **SMM updates**

Joystream DAO's Twitter feed has been consistently [updated](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/with_replies) with new content. 

### **Notion updates**

Marketers’ notion is being improved and updated. Looking forward to Council recommendations on how to improve it further.

## [smoothie.so](http://smoothie.so/) Awards

**Make sure that Joystream has enough votes to win the competition**

Joystream won the Smoothie Awards with a total of 661 votes. 

### Community growth

**High-priority Research on opportunities to increase our social metrics and overall activity on Telegram, Discord, and Twitter**

This research is ongoing and some ideas were proposed to increase community activity such as removing exploding messages in Joystream telegram (already executed by @bedeho) and creating a [Discord bot](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/316) that will allow users to transfer JOY off-chain.

### Hire new marketers

The applicants for the [opening](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/openings/operationsWorkingGroupGamma-9) were interviewed by the lead and two of them were hired. Tasks were assigned accordingly and we are looking forward to their contributions.

## **Extra items**

**Joystream Lightpaper**

The marketing working group took the initiative to perform the translation of the light paper into the Russian language.

**Video editing for JSG**

Two videos (AMA and YPP launch) were edited by the marketing working group for JSG to be published on Gleev.xyz.
