# **Work status for the Term**

According to the [Term 5 plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/68?post=754)

### Hackathon preparations

Hackathon preparations were not in [Council 5 term plan](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/159). We will come back to this once Council will come to an agreement to fund a Hackathon. 

### YPP launch preparations

**LBRY**

LBRY [database](https://www.notion.so/f34ed2aa26c64def82b4935860584945?pvs=21) was created and some categories (Finance, Tech, Gaming, and Education) were filled with data. The marketing working group was not able to finalize this task due to YouTube limitations (5 contact grabs per day) and a large amount of work on Crew3. 

**Cryptocurrency niche** 

Work in progress. More than 415 YouTube channels were added to [database 1](https://www.notion.so/Popular-Crypto-Channels-Database-9d7a8e8e3d8b41bfb9a3aba3b8ee1b38?pvs=21) and [database 2](https://www.notion.so/644fc286cbcc4089abe2ec5df1724ce9?pvs=21) during term 5.

**YPP testing and providing feedback**

We were unable to work on the YPP testing due to delays in its launch by JSG.

**Drafting initial email templates for contacting content creators**

Initial templates were prepared and added to the dedicated [notion](https://www.notion.so/Email-templates-2f10efb23fff497b970c40da9b72f2a7?pvs=21) page.

### Crew3 campaign

**Support**

Necessary support was provided to participants in Discord. 

**Updates**

The Crew3 campaign is being updated regularly by adding new quests, adjusting the XP balance, and removing outdated quests. Based on feedback, some changes were made, including the removal of the Solve GitHub issue quest and the addition of new quests focused on the builders working group growth. We also have a dedicated pioneer [thread](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/231) to collect feedback from Council and leads.

**Review completed quests**

Marketing working group consistently reviewing quests, we devote a lot of time and effort to this task during the term.

**Promotion outside JS**

The Crew3 campaign was promoted using various channels such as Telegram cryptocurrency and NFT communities and target advertising.

**Gathering metrics and evaluating campaign results**

All metrics were gathered for further evaluation. More than 48000 quests were approved during this term and added to the notion [database](https://www.notion.so/f8238236148541efa1168d2ed89bb1e0?pvs=21).

**Statistics**

The gathered statistics reveal notable social metrics and community engagement growth.

| 5 | [https://t.me/JoyStreamOfficial](https://t.me/JoyStreamOfficial) | 1341 | **+734** | 2075 | +55% | Despite the majority of work being focused on Discord, we must still cultivate growth in the Telegram chat as it holds value for the community. |
| 6 | [Joystream in the watchlist on CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/joystream/) | 284 | **+837** | 1121 | +295% | Positive outcome; significant metric for JOY market launch. |
| 7 | [Coinmarketcap Community](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/JoystreamDAO) | N/A | **+634** | 634 |  | The account is owned by the marketing working group, and significant updates will be posted there. |

| 13 | Crew3 participants | 100 | **+5400** | 5500 | +5400% | Although the result is OK, the absence of the "Invite 30 Crew friends" quest for seven days may have contributed to a lower number than expected. |

**Spending**

Currently, 58 participants have qualified for JOY rewards, averaging around ~2.2K and ~130K JOY in total. However, the campaign will be running for 10 more days, so we anticipate the final payout to be between 200K-300K JOY. The chart below indicated percentages of earned XP among participants.

![Untitled](5%20term%20report/Untitled%201.png)

The final numbers will slightly decrease as the marketing working group will review winners and their submissions, and non-compliant entries will not receive JOY payouts.

### Content creation

**Create content for social media posts and forum announcements/updates**

The marketing working group has been actively generating and [posting](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/with_replies) content on social media, although the demands of the Crew3 campaign may lead to results that are lower than anticipated.

**Finalize video about JOY token utility**. 

The video was finalized and [uploaded](https://gleev.xyz/video/866) to Gleev.

**Create illustration assets in Joystream branding that can be utilized by DAO (e.g. marketing purposes)**

As part of term 5, the marketing working group designed multiple assets in the Joystream brand style, such as illustrations and SMM background templates. While these have yet to be uploaded online, we are seeking the Council's input on where to store them.

### Research

**Research on social media platforms, communities, and forums where we can introduce Joystream.**

Ongoing research is being utilized by the lead to promote the Crew3 campaign and introduce Joystream to different communities and platforms. However, due to the possibility of malicious use, the outcomes of the research will be kept confidential.

**Continue on with marketing strategy development and gateway onboarding program**

Our marketing strategy is evolving as we conduct ongoing research, with a new plan set to be published in Q2.

**Research/analysis of the Bitcointalk campaign's effectiveness**

Due to insufficient data and a high load during term 5, the task is being postponed to the next Council terms.

**Research on audiences of content creators outside of YouTube who possess an anti-monopoly mindset and are highly likely to be interested in joining Joystream**

Due to insufficient data and a high load during term 5, the task is being postponed to the next Council terms.

### Joy token listing preparations

A dedicated notion [page](https://www.notion.so/JOY-Listing-24b861dce3894302b4f5b4a020585680?pvs=21) was made to track listing activities.

### SMM updates

Joystream DAO's Twitter feed has been consistently [updated](https://twitter.com/joystream_mwg/with_replies) with new content. More than 40 new tweets were posted during term 5.

### Notion updates

Marketers’ notion is being improved and updated. Looking forward to Council recommendations on how to improve it further.
