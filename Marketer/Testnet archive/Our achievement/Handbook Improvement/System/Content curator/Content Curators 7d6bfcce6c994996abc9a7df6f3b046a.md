# Content Curators

Content Curators monitor the publishing of new content into the content directory, respond to reports about contested publications, adjudicate possible dispute processes resulting from reports from users.

The working group focuses on appealing to people’s interests by creating engaging and entertaining digital content to be expressed through any medium connecting Joystream to its users. The objective is to make an impact on Joystream by researching and gathering information to create an informative, engaging piece of content and also keeping track of this content once it is published.
