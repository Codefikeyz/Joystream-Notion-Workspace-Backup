# Content Directory

The Content Directory is managed by an elected Lead and operates as a Working Group on the platform. The Lead and Workers curate content and make decisions regarding content. These are the main priorities in the work of curators: the safety of Joystream viewers, creators, and partners. For curation on testnets, has been developed a policy.

The content directory is an on-chain index of all content and metadata, and related concepts - such as channels and playlists. The data model was conceived to facilitate publishing and curation objectives inherent to the platform within the constraints of the blockchain environment. The working group focuses on appealing to people’s interests by creating engaging and entertaining digital content to be expressed through any medium connecting Joystream to its users.
