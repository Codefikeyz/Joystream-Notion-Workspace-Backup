# Distributor workers

The worker ensures that all worker nodes are operational and the playback at [Atlas](https://play.joystream.org/) goes smoothly, without error from the distributors’ side. Distributor workers send data to users on demand, replicate data from storage providers following the local caching policy, and maintain public host resolution metadata.
