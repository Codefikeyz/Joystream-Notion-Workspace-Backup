The builder’s working group already has content but it isn’t enough. That is why MWG prepared content to replace sections with easy-to-understand content and add some content.

We need to replace the description of the BWG lead in this way [here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/builders#builder-lead):

[Builder’s lead](Builders%20working%20group/Builder%E2%80%99s%20lead%203e17e23f6bba48d5ab26f7c60a2f838a.md)

We need to replace the description of the BWG worker in this way [here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/builders#builder):

[Builder’s worker](Builders%20working%20group/Builder%E2%80%99s%20worker%209690129ed6964dabb09dfaaa45ca86a7.md)
