To make handbook easy to understand, MWG made some recommendation to @Ben Holden-Crowther to review it and provide feedback. 

For introduction of HR working group, we need to make these 👇 changes in [Introduction](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/human-resources#introduction) section of HR working group in handbook. 

[HR working group - Introduction](HR%20working%20group%20-%20System/HR%20working%20group%20-%20Introduction%20e1418a1b313142a5b8111771c881f1da.md)

[HR working group Lead](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/human-resources#hr-lead) description in hand book contain very minimal and insufficient information in it. That’s why we need to make it sufficient for newcomers. MWG recommend to replace this section with following description about HR working group lead. 

[HR working group - Lead](HR%20working%20group%20-%20System/HR%20working%20group%20-%20Lead%20e3734cd9b94546559435e19041d014a0.md)

[Integrator](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/human-resources#hr-representative) is a worker in HR working group. Handbook gives insufficient information about HR representatives. MWG recommend to replace this section with following description about HR working group representative. 

[HR working group - Representative ](HR%20working%20group%20-%20System/HR%20working%20group%20-%20Representative%20b3733a655a0d443298bb66f95b98ede0.md)

There is no information in handbook about Responsibilities for HR working group and Requirements for being HR worker. MWG recommend to introduce these two sections in HR working group:

1. Responsibilities
2. Requirements

Please checkout the Responsibilities and Requirements for HR working group:
