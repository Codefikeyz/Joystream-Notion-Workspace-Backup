# Introduction

Marketers promote Joystream products and services both within the community and outside by increasing awareness and motivating more people to join the platform. As every other working group, they are accountable to the Council and have a set of goals to achieve in each Term. [Marketers Score](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/marketers-score) is a quantitative representation of how effective the group is in achieving its goals.

# Marketer

In order to effectively achieve the goals of the group, Marketer Lead hires different kinds of marketers, the quantity and responsibilities of which can change over time depending on the current needs of the DAO. [Here](https://dao.joystream.org/#/working-groups/marketing) you can see the number of workers in Marketing group at the moment as well as current openings. 
Though all workers are referred to as Marketing workers, they have different roles inside the group. There are 3 main directions of marketing activity:
