# Catastrophic Error and Late WG report

[Here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score#catastrophic-errors) we need to add that if WG submit report late then it will also count as catastrophic error.

We can add in this way:

**Late Report**

The Report is late by >6 hours or more.
