# Distributors Score value of 2

[Here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/distributors-score#score) 

**We need to** **specify what value 2 means and why these indicators are more important:** DISTRIBUTOR_SCORE = [2*GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + 2*SYSTEM_SCORE + COST_SCORE]/(6*2^{N})

I believe this is necessary so that the data is understandable for experienced project participants and beginners who have just joined it.
