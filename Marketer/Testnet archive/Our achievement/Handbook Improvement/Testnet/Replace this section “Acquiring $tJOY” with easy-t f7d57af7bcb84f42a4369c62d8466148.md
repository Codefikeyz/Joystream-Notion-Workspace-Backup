# Replace this section “Acquiring $tJOY” with easy-to-understand info

In the following [section](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/usdtjoy#acquiring-usdtjoy), we should information easier to understand which is why mwg proposes the following content to replace with existing:

1. **Acquiring $tJOY**.
- In the first way how to get $tJOY, there is a link to # [Feeling lost](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/#feeling-lost). Go speak to our integrators. Needs to specify contacts or links how specifically, when, and with whom people can contact, and through what communication?
- Try to create a membership in [Pioneer](http://dao.joystream.org/), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY. The link leads to the working groups. it's confusing what needs to be done. Needs to give a link to the manual on How to create a membership in Pioneer.
- The same, for the next one - Try to create a channel in [Atlas](http://play.joystream.org/), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY. Give a link to the manual as How to create a membership in Atlas.
