# Testnet Rewards

[Here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/testnet-rewards) in handbook, we describe the testnet rewards. We show enough information there but along with unnecessary information also. For example if we visit following sections in this “Tesetnet Rewards🤑”:

1. [Council Period Cadence](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/testnet-rewards#council-period-cadence) 
2. [Council Period Parameters](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/testnet-rewards#council-period-parameters)

We will observe that these descriptions are irrelevant here. So, MWG recommend to migrate these two sections from [testnet rewards](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/testnet-rewards) to [Council Period Scoring](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring).
