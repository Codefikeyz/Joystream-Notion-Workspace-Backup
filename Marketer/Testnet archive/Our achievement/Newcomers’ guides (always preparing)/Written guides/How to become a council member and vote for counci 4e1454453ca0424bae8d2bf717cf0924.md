# How to become a council member and vote for council’s candidates? (1)

***Council*** - the politically selected governance body responsible for managing the proposal system for the benefit of voters.

At the heart of the governance process on the platform is the proposal system, which allows anyone to submit some suggestion for changing the state or policy of the platform in some way. These proposals are processed and voted on by a council, where the participants are referred to as council members. A seat on the council is on through an election process, and lasts for some period of time until a new selection. Now this period is one week.

More information about the Council you can find [here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/system/council).

Elections occur periodically, and each one has a sequence of stages referred to as the election cycle. Stages are: ***announcing period*, *voting period and revealing period*.** [Here](https://dao.joystream.org/#/election) you can see the number of current elections, period remaining length and the Election stage.

**Let's see what the consuls are responsible for:**

- Discuss the meaning and merits of incoming proposals, covering a broad range of topics
- Vote on proposals (for example, hiring Working Group leaders, budget and funding decisions as well as many others).
- Represent the community members and your constituency to make day-to-day operations decisions

**Requirements:**

- Proficiency with basic data analysis and sufficient reputation and standing within the community to earn supporting votes in elections from other platform members
- A deep understanding of the Joystream platform structure, function and resource allocation
- Hold sufficient amount of the native platform token to put at stake (11 000 tJOY).

Elections are held once a week on Thursdays. You can apply by following the [link](https://dao.joystream.org/#/council). Applications for elections are accepted within a day from the moment of their opening.

***Announcing period***

***Voting period***

This is the stage where voters can submit votes in favor of candidates. The votes are sealed, meaning that it is only known that some account voted for an unknown, possibly invalid candidate, with a known amount of tokens.

At least 5 people need to candidate for the election to go to the voting phase, after that the 5 candidates with more "vote power" (so more stake + voting stake) will be selected for the council. A single member can vote multiple times with different accounts on different candidates.

Importantly, a vote which was devoted to a losing candidate can be freed the moment the election cycle is over, while a vote which was devoted to a winner can only be freed after the announcing period of the next election begins. The idea behind this asymmetry is to more closely expose the winners to the consequences of their decision.

The vote has two stages, being sealed and unsealed, each having the following associated information:

- Sealed: This is the initial stage when a vote is submitted during a the voting period of an election. The only information available is called a voting commitment, which is a opaque hash digest;
- Unsealed**:** This is the stage which occurs if the voter chooses to reveal the their sealed vote during the revealing stage. This has stage has information about a **valid candidate**, and a **nonce**, which when concatenated together are the pre-image of the initial hash digest.

The voting period lasts a day from the moment of their opening. You can vote by clicking on this [link](https://dao.joystream.org/#/election).

**Revealing period**

**Disclosure of votes** is necessary so that the votes for the candidate are counted. That is, you can vote for a candidate, but if you don't reveal your vote later, it won't be counted.

Importantly, even if there is an insufficient number of valid votes revealed to render a set of winners with non-zero backing stake, the runtime will just pick a winning set deterministically.

1. **Reveal your vote**
