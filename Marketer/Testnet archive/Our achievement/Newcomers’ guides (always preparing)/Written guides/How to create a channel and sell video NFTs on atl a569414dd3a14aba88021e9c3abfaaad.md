**How to create a channel and sell video NFTs on atlas?**

Atlas is a decentralized video platform of Joystream. Via Atlas you can create a channel, publish content, issue and trade NFTs. You can take a look at it [*here*](https://play.joystream.org/).

In order to log in to Joystream and start using Atlas, you need to install the extension in the Polkadot browser. Below are the detailed instructions how you can do it. Remember that even if you have already installed the extension and have some Polkadot accounts created for other networks, for privacy reasons it is recommended that you create a new Polkadot account for Joystream network.

### **1. Install Polkadot.js extension**

The Polkadot extension provides a mechanism to generate an account and interact with all Polkadot/Kusama projects including Joystream. If you don’t have this extension in your browser, the first step will be to install it. The browser extension is available for [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en) (plus Chromium-based browsers), so click the relevant link and install.

**2. Creating an account**.

Сlick on the Polkadot extension

**7. Sell video NFT**

You have option to mint your video as NFT. Its way to get full copyrights and make money if you want.

You won’t be able to edit this video once you mint an NFT for it.

For the time being no fees are required for blockchain transactions. This will change in the future.

Minting an NFT creates a record of ownership on the blockchain that can be put on sale. This will not impact your intellectual right of the video

**8. Set the creator's royalties**.

Setting royalties lets you earn commission from every sale of this NFT. Creator royalties cannot be lower than 1%

The way the royalties work in the context of NFTs is that when an artist or a person who's creating the NFT initially sets it up, they could build into the code by way of something called a “smart contract” a method of pushing a portion of the resale proceeds back to the original creator.
