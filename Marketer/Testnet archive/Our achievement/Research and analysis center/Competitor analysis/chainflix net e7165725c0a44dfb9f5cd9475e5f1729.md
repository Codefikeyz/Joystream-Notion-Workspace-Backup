### **Overview of Chainflix FLIXER program for content creators**

[Chainflix](https://www.chainflix.net/) has 2 types of channels: regular and FLIXER (verified). They assume different upload limits, monetization opportunity and some other aspects. Most important is that only FLIXER channels can earn rewards, which are paid in Chainflix Coins(CFX). I made a comparison and created a table of differences between regular and FLIXER channels.

## **How to register for the program**

In order to apply for FLIXER, you must be at least 19 years old and complete [KYC verification](https://www.chainflix.net/member/setting/#kycDialog) via the phone and provide identity documents.There are [2 options](https://www.chainflix.net/block/smsVerified?redirect=chainflixer-regist&checkType=chainflixer): a mobile phone verification and KYC verification (but if you choose it, your mobile phone number is also verified.) I tried to complete a phone verification without KYC, but I was not able to do it with both my Russian and Singaporean phone numbers (the button “Request” after entering the phone number just remained inactive). So, in order to register, I should have to upload my ID (drivers license, resident registration card, passport, etc.), provide contact information and make a photo of my face.

## **FLIXER creators rewards**

Rewards are paid in cryptocurrency Chainflix Coins (CFX). The amount of rewards is determined by the number of views. Aslo, the longer videos will earn more rewards when somebody watched them (could not find info about the algorithm).

On Chainflix, every 43.2 seconds [67.5CFX](https://www.chainflix.net/helpCenter/faq/main1/main1_2#24) is rewarded to the users. Rewards are given to users that mine CFX within the predetermined ratio. (i.e. storage provider, creator, viewer, with the exception of non-registered users). The rewards for watching a video are splitted between the content creator and the viewer. When a member watches the video, the creator gets [55% of rewards](https://www.chainflix.net/helpCenter/faq/main1/main1_2#25) and the viewer gets 45%. So, the more views you have — the more CFX you will earn.

It is also said that FLIXERs can “receive additional profit from advertising”, but I could not find any details. They recently introduced a new feature — [Search for Creators](https://www.chainflix.net/creator). It is a matchmaking service, which allows to search and find creators who can help to promote a product or a service. Maybe this is what was meant by additional profit from advertising.

I tried to find out how much FLIXER creators can earn, but could not find this information. I stumbled across this [review](https://paidfromsurveys.com/chainflix-review), in which the author says that the rewards are supposed to be low, but admits that he “personally didn’t try this feature out”. I also found several videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BWsZiVA2ik) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YthCemO_XM) about creators rewards, but all they say is that you’ll be earning “pennies of the dollar”. On Reddit there is also very little information.

Overall, it seems that this program is not popular and the earnings are low.

## **FLIXER referral rewards**

FLIXER Referral program is rewarding users widespreading the ‘FLIXER PROGRAM’. When applying for FLIXER, invited creators need to enter your nickname. If invited creator is selected as FLIXER, you will get 5,000 CFX (applies only during Open Beta). Whenever invited creators are selected as FLIXER, you will receive referral reward, so you can get multiple rewards the more you “spread the word!” Referrer must complete mobile phone number verification and KYC verification.

## **The number of FLIXERs**

One thing I like is their announcements on Twitter, introducing new FLIXERs. The announcement looks like this:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*dqGS6aBGhAo9Drw3ZfuYQg.png)

The first such announcement was made on March 11, introducing 3 new FLIXERs. For some reason they stopped doing this, as the last announcement was made on June 3. Maybe there are just no new FLIXERs to be introduced or perhaps they are getting less active on their Twitter. But having the data from March to June allows to estimate the popularity of this program judging by the number of new FLIXERs in Twitter announcements:

- March 11–3
- March 18–4
- April 1–2
- April 8–3
- April 22–2
- April 29–4
- May 6–1
- June 3–3

As you can see, the amount of FLIXERs registered for the program is very low and the number of creators actually earning CFX should be even lower. Maybe that’s why I could not find any detailed reviews about the program and earnings.
