### **Cloudflare Stream
Synopsis**

Cloudflare Stream is a live streaming and on-demand video platform, which can ingest, encode, record, and play videos from one unified product.
Stream is built for developers on the world’s most-connected network, offering effortless scale and affordable pricing to build your video pipeline
At its core, Cloudflare is a Connected Cloud Network service founded in 2004 by Matthew Prince and Lee Holloway to answer the basic question, "Where does email spam come from?" They created a system that allows anyone with a Web site to keep track of how spammers collect e-mail addresses. Thus the Honey Pot project was born.

The Honey Pot project grew quietly over the years. Lee's flexible system architecture adapted to track more of the threats website administrators faced. Thousands of Web sites from more than 185 countries signed up to participate. While users loved Project Honey Pot's ability to track malicious behavior on the Internet, they had one constant request: not just to track the bad guys, but to stop them.
So the decision was made to create a service that would take Project Honey Pot to the next level: not just tracking Internet threats, but stopping them. Classmates began working on a business plan.

One of the first things to do was to come up with a name. The first business plan was titled "The Web Wall Project," but that hardly resonated. One of Matthew's friends suggested that they were creating a "firewall in the cloud," so the company should be called Cloudflare. The name immediately seemed right and stuck. Matthew and Michelle worked with Harvard Business School professors to refine the business plan. Meanwhile, Lee, in his spare time, created the first working prototype. In April 2009, Cloudflare won the prestigious Harvard Business School business plan competition.
Cloudflare not only  protected  against online bad guys, but their sites were loading, on average, 30% faster. The efficiency of Cloudflare’s system, the layer of caching for static resources, and the fact that Cloudflare was taking so much garbage traffic off its user’s sites meant Cloudflare not only offered security, it also offered incredible performance.
Since then, Cloudflare has launched dozens of products and hundreds of features over the course of 6 years, opened 6 offices across 3 countries, and brought 270 data centers online. All of these efforts have brought Cloudflare's benefits: security, performance, reliability and insights, to millions of customers around the globe.

### **Stream direction**

Cloudflare stream as one of the directions of the company is essentially a solution for scaling in streaming of various video formats. All Cloudflare network locations run the necessary software to ingest and deliver videos, so you don’t have to worry about adding new compute instances, setting up availability zones, or negotiating additional software licenses.
Stream supports uploads for video formats such as H.264, H.265, ProRes and VP9. Live videos automatically are converted to recordings instantly so viewers can access it later. Videos automatically are converted to modern formats that can be viewed on most devices.

### Scalability

Cloudflare stream give us Advanced access control
We can Limit who can view your live videos with self-expiring tokenized links for each viewer. When generating the tokenized links, you can define constraints including time-based expiration, geo-fencing and IP restrictions.
The service serves an average of 35 million HTTP requests per second.
The company achieves these astonishing results through the implementation of three factors:
***Accelerate Web Applications***
Today's web pages are increasingly complex with a globally dispersed audience, which can degrade the user experience.
Cloudflare increases web application performance by bringing content closer to your users, caching static content on its network, optimizing image files, compressing dynamic content, routing requests to the least congested path, and much more.
***Accelerate Mobile Experiences***
Increase engagement and conversions, regardless of distance to origin servers, device type, or network health
Mobile visitors expect fast, rich online experiences. Mobile device and cellular network limitations can degrade a users mobile experience, resulting in lower conversions, loss of revenue, and degraded brand perception.
Mobile applications and web pages require the speed and scale of a global network to combat mobile-induced latencies and globally dispersed users with poor connectivity. Cloudflare optimizes image files for mobile consumption, and provides developers with tools to improve native mobile app performance on challenging networks.
***Ensure Application Availability***
Improving the availability of applications affected by overloaded or unavailable infrastructure.
Users expect their mission-critical applications to always be online and available. Internet applications deployed on a global scale are highly susceptible to outages or downtime due to spikes in traffic, high network latency or server outages at the origin. Cloudflare improves application availability by monitoring network latency and server health at the origin, identifying the best resource from which to serve user requests for dynamic content.

Connection to Stream is made through API request
To make your first request to the Stream API, you must obtain these pieces of information:

Your Cloudflare Account ID
A Cloudflare Account API Token

### Cloudflare solutions for web 3 video platforms

The Cloudflare service network does not need any virtual machines, servers or containers to spin up or manage.
It allows developers to easily deploy applications using a command line interface, web interface or API. (Each deployment is performed across a network of data centers running V8 isolators)

Create entirely new applications or extend existing ones without deploying infrastructure. Based on an isolated rather than containerized model, there is no need to select regions, manage scaling, or pay for resources you don't use. Cold start time is eliminated, and your code runs in every data center in the Cloudflare network, which is within milliseconds of virtually every Internet user.

Cloudflare Stream supports both HLS and DASH standards for adaptive bitrate streaming that can be embedded on your website. It automatically encodes videos to create multiple size and quality levels, allowing the videos to be fast and responsive for any device used by the viewer.
