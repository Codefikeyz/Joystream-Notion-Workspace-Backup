# Description

LBRY is the first digital marketplace to be controlled by the market's participants rather than a corporation or other 3rd-party. It is the most open, fair, and efficient marketplace for digital goods ever created, with an incentive design encouraging it to become the most complete.

At the highest level, LBRY does something extraordinarily simple. LBRY creates an association between a unique name and a piece of digital content, such as a movie, book, or game. This is similar to the domain name system that you are most likely using to access this very post.

However, LBRY does this not through a proprietary service or network, but as a *protocol*, or a method of doing things, much like HTTP, DNS and other specifications that make up the internet itself. Just as many different domains owned by many different companies all speak a shared language, so too can any person or company speak LBRY. No special access or permission is needed.

LBRY develops in three fundamental planes:

1. **Coupled payment and access**. If desired, the person who publishes to [lbry://rhapsody-film#e1029aaa08bef8e9225efcbfb94a895e9bbdc8ea](https://open.lbry.com/@CalibreMusic:2/rhapsody-film:e) can charge a fee to users that view the content.
2. **Decentralized and distributed**. Content published to LBRY is not specific to one computer or network, making LBRY robust to failure and disruption.
3. **Community controlled**. No party other than the publisher (including us) can unilaterally remove or block content on the LBRY network.

While creating a protocol that we ourselves cannot control sounds chaotic, it is actually about establishing trust. Every other publishing system requires trusting an intermediary that can unilaterally change the rules on you. What happens when you build your business on YouTube or Amazon and they change fees? Or Apple drops your content because the Premier of China thought your comedy went too far?

Only LBRY consists of a known, promised set of rules that no one can unilaterally change. LBRY provides this by doing something unique: leaving the *users* in control rather than demanding that control for itself.

The lbry platform is integrated with Odyssey, a popular decentralized video hosting application for posting and monetizing video content.

# How it works

Let's look at a sample use of LBRY, Ernest releasing a film on LBRY that is later purchased and viewed by Hillary.

1. Ernest wants to release his comedy-horror film, *Ernie Runs For President*.
2. The content is encrypted and sliced into many pieces. These pieces are stored by hosts.
3. Ernest reserves lbry://ernieruns, a name pointing to his content.
4. When Ernest reserves the location, he also submits metadata, such as a description and thumbnail.
5. Hillary, a user, opens her browser, searches the LBRY network, and decides she wants to watch the film.
6. Hillary issues a payment to Ernest for the decryption key, allowing her to watch the film.
7. Hillary's LBRY client collects the pieces from the hosts and reassembles them, using the key to decrypt the pieces (if necessary). This is transparent to Hillary, the film streams within a few seconds after purchase.

From a user's perspective, interaction is extremely similar to those that happen on hundreds of different sites, similar to YouTube, Amazon and Netflix. The key difference is that this one happens via a network that is completely decentralized. The data and technology that makes the entire interaction possible is not reliant on nor controlled by any single entity.

To understand precisely what LBRY is and why it matters, one must understand both LBRY as a protocol and the services the protocol enables. HTTP is the protocol that makes web browsing possible, but it would be of little interest without the service of a web browser!

To understand LBRY, think of LBRY in terms of two layers: *protocol* and *service.* The protocol provides a fundamental, underlying technological capability. The service layer utilizes the protocol to do something that a human being would actually find useful.

For a user using LBRY at the service level, the magic of what the LBRY protocol does will be largely transparent, much as a typical internet user sees nothing of how HTTP works. Via a LBRY application, a user will be able to open a familiar interface to quickly and easily discover and purchase a piece of digital content published by anyone in the world.

However, such an application would not be possible without the LBRY the underlying layer, the LBRY protocol.

### **Layer 1: Protocol**

While the protocol is one comprehensive set of rules, it is easier to understand as two parts.

### **Part A: The LBRY Blockchain**

A *blockchain*, or *distributed ledger* is the key innovation behind the Bitcoin network. Blockchains solved the very complicated technological problem of having a bunch of distributed, disparate entities all agree on a rivalrous state of affairs (like how much money they owe each other).

### **Part B: The Data Network (LBRYNet)**

LBRYNet is the layer that makes the LBRY blockchain useful beyond a simple payment system. It says what to do with the information available in the LBRY blockchain, how to issue payments, how to look up a content identifier, and so on.

To use the LBRY network, a user's computer needs the capacity to speak LBRY. That layer is LBRYNet. Just as your computer has a library that enables it to understand HTTP, DNS, and other languages and protocols, LBRYNet is the piece of software that allows your computer to understand how to interact with the LBRY network.

### **Layer 2: Services**

Services are what actually make the LBRY protocol *useful.* While the LBRY protocol determines what is possible, it is the services that actually do things.

While the protocol is determined, open, and fixed, the service layer is much more flexible. It is far easier to redesign a website than it is to revise the HTTP protocol itself. The same is true here.

Additionally, just as in the early days of the internet, imagining the later direction of the web would have been unfathomable, so too may the best uses of LBRY's namespace or technology be undiscovered. However, there are some clear use cases:

### **Applications and Devices**

### **Content Discovery**

### **Content Distribution**

### **Transaction Settlement**

LBRY Credits, or *LBC*, are the unit of account for LBRY. Eventually 1,000,000,000 LBC will exist, according to a defined schedule over 20 years. The schedule decays exponentially, with around 100,000,000 in the first year.

Additionally, some Credits are awarded on a fixed basis. The total breakdown looks like this:

- 10% for organizations, charities, and other strategic partners. Organizations like the EFF, ACLU, and others that have fought for digital rights and the security and freedom of the internet.
- 20% for adoption programs. We'll be giving out lots of bonus Credits, especially in the early days of LBRY, in order to encourage participation. We will also look to award Credits broadly, ensuring the marketplace is egalitarian.
- 10% for us. For operational costs as well as profit.
- 60% earned by LBRY users, via mining the LBRY cryptocurrency.

Current price of  **LBRY Credits for june 21 2022 is** **$0.01024**

# **Conclusion**

The lbry platform is going the way of decentralization, the right way to meet the needs of mankind today!

However, it is impossible not to notice that LBRY is missing the main thing in the concept of decentralized approach development, namely the implementation of its concept in the form of DAO.

There is a feeling that it is this step that the platform lacks in order to implement all those manifestos about which it declares on the pages of its resource

“We want to be the first digital content marketplace to:

1. **Treat users like adults.**LBRY doesn't play nanny. It encourages individual people to express their own preferences, rather than force our own onto them. We enable consumers to make their own choices about where and who they want to purchase digital content from.
2. **Operate openly, inclusively, and transparently.**Anyone can publish or interact with the LBRY network. No one needs permission from us or anyone else. LBRY encourages all parties to participate in the network, rather than the creation of walled gardens. LBRY is a completely open specification and all code is open source.
3. **Prove decentralization doesn't mean infringement.**Existing decentralized publishing protocols offer no way for right holders to combat or capture profits from illegally shared content. LBRY's service layer, blacklisting mechanisms, and naming system all improve the status quo.
4. **Acknowledge modern digital realities and ethical norms.**Prohibition has failed at every turn and in every iteration. Regulating human behavior only works when it aligns with moral norms that are shared by the majority of the population.If it is impossible to keep drugs out of prisons, it will never be possible to enforce copyright via analogous tactics on the infinitely less-controlled internet. Instead, focus on enticement. While legal compliance is paramount, concentrate as much as possible on making a system that relies more on giving people no excuse to do the wrong thing.
5. **Collect no rent.**Whatever an artist or creator charges for their work should go to them. Distributing bits is exceedingly simple. There's no need to give 45% to YouTube or 30% to Apple. Collecting no rent isn't just a promise, it's hard coded. The nature of LBRY means this could never be done -- by us or anyone else.”
