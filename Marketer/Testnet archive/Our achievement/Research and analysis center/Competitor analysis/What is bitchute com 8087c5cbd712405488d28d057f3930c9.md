# What is bitchute.com

A peer-to-peer content sharing platform and associated services. BitChute aims to put creators first and provide them with a service that they can use to flourish and express their ideas freely.

BitChute intends to become YouTube without censorship protected in part by including decentralized BitTorrent functionality. (The BitChute website as a single internet location will remain centralized until everyone can somehow be part-co-host, like FreeNet or ZeroNet. This is a “decentralization” myth/flaw/oversight shared with countless other sites that claim to be free, like Steemit, Gab, InfoGalactic, etc.) Unfortunately, the torrent magnets are not on every video, and sadly when in your torrent que mostly remain not seeded nor downloaded. This could easily be fixed if, in addition to their YouTube-style playback, BitChute seeded all their videos too. When the torrents are absent or unseeded you are forced to watch the videos on their site or use a browser flash downloader to save for your archive. Also, naming option settings for the video magnet torrents is absolutely necessary. Currently you download a video file with a short video ID alphanumeric coded name, rather than a good title including useful descriptors like where it came from (BitChute), the author/channel/publisher, the name of the file/video/title, the date, and other details such as the short alphanumeric code, the video resolution, audio compression, and/or the time length.
