**Description**

Minds is an open source social network dedicated to Internet freedom. Speak freely, protect your privacy, earn crypto rewards and take back control of your social media.

Minds was launched its app in 2015, as the network for

greater organic reach, privacy and monetization opportunities.

Now it has more than 6 million users ( as their sours claim)

They hold themselves to certain principles to ensure that you are provided with unrestricted, real-time access to all information shared on the network.

Their code and algorithms are free and open source for maximum transparency and accountability. Their content policy is based on the First Amendment and governed by a community jury in order to minimize bias and censorship.

They believe you can only change someone's mind if you provide them with a platform to speak it.

The value of media platforms lies in its community. You deserve to be rewarded for your contributions to the network's success and growth.

Minds rewards you with MINDS tokens (ERC-20) every day for creating popular content, attracting friends or providing liquidity. You can then use the tokens to promote your content (1 token = 1,000 impressions) or send tips to content creators to show your support and unlock special perks.

Promote such symbols of decentralization as:

Freedom of speech.

Privacy

Open Source

Autocracy

Community governance

Cryptoeconomics

The interface of the platform is a strong mix of Facebook news feed and Twitter with a more convenient use of video content

To the left of the news feed there is also a page control panel where you can switch between your channels, chats, groups, feed and wallet

The platform has its own native MINDS token traded on Uniswap and BKEX

MINDS tokens are used across the network for advertising, liquidity mining, ad mining, rewards, tipping, unlocking memberships and establishing decentralized reputation. The underlying principle is to fairly 3 compensate community participants contributing the most to different aspects of the ecosystem through daily rewards. The hybrid on-chain/off-chain system enables scalability and easy UX while simultaneously empowering users with the option to transact with tokens via sovereign web3 wallets.

Moving forward, token holders on the Minds network will be able to easily pool their MINDS holdings

alongside ETH, USDC, USDT or any other supported pools in the future, to provide liquidity for the token

and earn. Users who provide liquidity to the MINDS pool on Uniswap earn fees as well as benefits on

the Minds app such as daily token rewards and the option for automated advertising of your channel.

Liquidity providers can opt-in to receive a share of ad space in a new featured ad slot on the main

newsfeed based on their proportional share of the MINDS liquidity pool and pool token balance.

**Monetization tools**

The main tool of platform monetization is MindsPay

With Minds Pay (formerly known as ‘Wire’), any user on the network is able to send MINDS directly to

other users, either as a tip for enjoying content or as a payment for a premium membership such as

Minds+ or Minds Pro. Memberships enable Minds and its users to offer perks to fans in exchange for a

payment, such as posting exclusive content behind a paywall. Minds Pay also supports Bitcoin, Ether

and cash payments.

The MINDS platform has a pretty successful development and strong, working tokenomics!

Its main focus, on which it was originally built to attract users, is the lack of censorship, which is why famous bloggers such as Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, Dave Cullen and many other Influencers who were seen as dissidents on existing centralized media were some of the first to settle on the platform

On the downside, the ERC-20 contract on which the MINDS network is based is expensive, so many users prefer the cheaper centralized platforms, albeit with a more centralized management!

I would suggest that at the moment, the platform is more suitable for users with an existing, large audience and a high level of monetization than for newcomers.

However, the team is working to fix this and scale up
