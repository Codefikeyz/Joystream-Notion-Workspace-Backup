**1) Description**

At the outset, let us clarify that by the name Streamcoin we mean the generic name of MeiTalk service and its cryptocurrency Streamcoin.

So, Streamcoin is a streaming platform based on BSC blockchain, which allows users:

- Search and view all current and popular live streams from different platforms
- Comment and communicate with live streamers from their preferred streaming platform
- Earn StreamCoin (STRM) by watching ads on the MeiTalk platform
- Reward your favorite StreamCoin (STRM) streamers
- Simultaneously broadcast from MeiTalk to platforms like YouTube, Kuaishou, Twitch, AfreecaTV, etc.
- Communicate and interact with all or selected fans using special filters
- Earn 100% of all your StreamCoin rewards (STRM)
- Automatically create subtitles in multiple languages depending on your filter settings - Choose to show ads of your choice during a live broadcast
- Mint your videos and upload them to the NFT marketplace

MeiTalk intends to integrate blockchain technology to connect online users with streamers in a modern and improved way. It will focus on providing the world's first real-time blockchain-based streaming platform by developing a platform with three different types of layers; the MeiTalk Service Level, the MeiTalk Streaming Encoding Level and the MeiTalk Blockchain Level

According to the HubSpot 2021 study, live streaming will account for 82% of all Internet traffic in the coming years. What's more, advances in streaming - thanks to artificial intelligence and blockchain - will play a big role in the continued growth of the streaming industry. Market Research Future has even predicted that the market value of the live streaming industry will grow to $247,275[8] million by 2027.

And it is on these benchmarks that the fundamental concept of MeiTalk is based, which is to provide a blockchain-based multistreaming platform. It is developed at three levels: the MeiTalk service level, the MeiTalk streaming encoding level, and the MeiTalk blockchain level.

**2) Marketing**

- **Social Media**

Streamcoin is widely represented in social media outlets such as:

- Telegram

Telegram direction in the service has more than 17 official channels in 3 parts of the world with a total audience of more than 66 thousand subscribers.

The main news agenda in the channel is the upcoming Streamcoin airdrop and listing

- Twitter - 66 thousand followers
- Instagram
- Discord
- Facebook
- Linkedin
- YouTube

Everywhere between 2,000 and 4,000 subscribers

In all media there is an active interaction with the audience, and although the percentage of feedback is not high enough, it is clearly seen that the team clearly pays due attention to this area.

New content is published on a regular basis.

There is interaction with the audience according to all the rules of SMM.

There is a continuous flow of traffic between social networks and the main domain of the service!

You can say that due to the right construction of SMM marketing Streamcoin service has already laid the foundation of its community, which shows the general interest and involvement in the service!

- **Share of Marketing in Tokenomics**

[](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5JExV8CT5M8OYc2pSPd1XxgmPTIf1doSkrhuPWCYic94cbb9y3kUZ8QToCMTu3z15q_6x1xzc6D4ezf-jCEJvlSvVwumk_tOKC3V1XOZXSr8CH9OLFcy0rKMgEk9t92231YkP5RJ_XeHLd718O0AHmR7uLXl)

As you can see from the project's tokenomics map, more than 11% of the total token supply has been allocated to Streamcoin ecosystem development and company marketing.

At the initial stage, this was a key factor and as we have seen above, allowed us to create a fairly involved community of users in the project.

**3) Scaling**

- **Product**

As noted in the description, the service product itself MeiTalk is characterized by its built-in ability to stream live streams to various platforms, YouTube, Kuaishou, Twitch, AfreecaTV, etc. That in itself contributes to its initial and effective integration into the global base of popular media services. Which of course makes it easier to scale your marketing campaign

The ability to convert STRM tokens into cash through various wallets such as Trust Wallet, MetaMask, imToken and MyEtherWallet has the same impact.

- **Airdrop and ICOs**

The second, but no less important element of the scalability of the project was the ICO held in three stages and announced to all its participants airdrop.

It is not a secret that the existing global crypto-community likes to get free giveaways from different projects and in this case it worked too (proof of that are endless dialogues in Telegram chats and Twitter reviews)

Also the ICO itself without a doubt always attracts attention of the crypto community, even if in the beginning it is purely speculative, which eventually reveals to the user the very essence of the product and technology!

**4) Conclusion**

Streamcoin service carries out its marketing policy according to all modern rules of development of blockchain projects as well as media platforms. This has both strengths and weaknesses:

Pros:

Initial wide integration of the project into existing structures of social media resources

Fast recruitment of a loyal audience and therefore increased brand awareness.

Cons:

Too high competition in this area today. The overall approach in marketing policy does not allow to identify the distinctive features of the project, which will attract relevant users and professionals

In general, based on the analysis, we can say that the Streamcoin project is a serious competitor at the market of media platforms
