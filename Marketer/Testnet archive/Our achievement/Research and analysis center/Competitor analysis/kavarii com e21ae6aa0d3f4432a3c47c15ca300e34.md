# Idea

Over the last couple of decades, we experienced a digital revolution and we have seen some monumental technological leaps forward. People can connect around the globe, information has never been more accessible, and it’s become our main source of entertainment. However, this hyper-connection does not come without its drawbacks — information can still be filtered and altered, audiences can be influenced to see only one side of the story, and voices can be censored.

With the current state of censorship and cancel culture we find it extremely important to provide users with a tool that allows the freedom to speak their mind without fear of repression, and with the freedom to make their own decision on what’s acceptable, and tolerable, and what isn’t.

We are in a position today to go back to the drawing board and redesign the technology itself in such a way that decentralization is the main feature. The goal is to design censorship-resistant technology that gives the creator full ownership and creates a distribution network so vast that users feel empowered to share.

Do you ever feel like social networking giants are taking down your videos for no good reason, misleading you, and even profiting off your data and the content YOU produce? Users, are you tired of annoying ads, seeing your favorite videos disappear, or not being rewarded for your time? What if instead of being silenced, shadow banned, and hidden from the world you could actually be celebrated for your opinion and voice? Wouldn't you think that would make creators more creative and users more engaged?

Introducing Kavarii, video streaming as it should be. Giving the power back to the content creators who make social applications special. Instead of giving up your voice to obey legacy social networks’ terms, Kavarii allows you to voice your opinions freely and earn crypto with your very first like, in a 100% ad-free environment.

Kavarii is a 100% peer-2-peer video sharing platform built on the Elrond Blockchain. Users can mint videos as NFTs and interact completely on the blockchain in a decentralized environment.

Kavarii does not host any 3rd party ads, so we have developed a social economic structure that allows creators to earn with each like and subscribe they get from other Kavarii users. Utilizing the KVRI token, users send tokens with each like, subscribe, dislike and report. The like and subscribe tokens are sent directly to the creator as payment, and the dislike and report tokens go to a rewards pool that gets distributed to the users of the platform to incentivize engagement.

Kavarii is built 100% on the Elrond blockchain using Smart Contract and NFT technology. This is done to prohibit centralized ownership and censorship of user content. In the current political climate, we feel it's important for the people to have a voice, that is protected from the powers that be. Although we encourage freedom of speech, we also know this needs to be within the limits of the law. This is why we have built a proprietary algorithm that allows the general community to have the ability to report illegal content thru a reporting and blocking mechanism built directly into the smart contract as well as the community DAO. This approach we believe aligns with the true sense of democracy and not any single central authority having the power to censor users.

### Invasion of Freedoms:

For any reason at any point creators’ accounts can be deleted or videos can be taken down with no warning. As the Ethereum Foundation would say “In a single click, these platforms can lock you out of your entire online life.” And the worst part is that there are real people behind these decisions, human bias, subjectivity, and error all come into play. Typically they will give very little and vague reasoning behind their decision which makes it incredibly difficult to prevent it from happening again. For full-time content creators, this could be devastating to their business and even livelihood.

### Difficulty Monetizing:

For most creators, it's incredibly difficult to monetize their content, especially a sustainable income stream.

Legacy streaming networks require 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours before you make your first penny.

This can be so daunting for new creators that they give up or they don't try to pursue a future in the first place. Potentially great ideas,  with real value lost, due to the lack of financial support even if they do not lack supporters. Creators are a vital part of our life and are often taken for granted.

### Centralized Ownership

The major decisions governing the large social networks are in the hands of a relatively concentrated network of major corporations. They are in control of what people see, hear, and overall perception of reality. They are gaining more and more control over online speech every day. Who really owns the content if it can be taken away or the rules of the game can change at any time?

*Problems Users Face*

### Security

Tech Giants know us much better than we think. Users’ personal and professional data gets collected and sold to advertisers with zero compensation. Data such as:

Personal information: Name, gender, email, phone number.

Geographic location: GPS and IP.

Interactions with websites you surf: hobbies, interests, and preferences.

Professional data: Where you work and past work history.

There are even whole marketplaces that exist specifically just to buy and sell users’ personal data. You aren't just trusting the platforms you use with your data, your intimate details about your life are being entered into an ever-expanding digital universe.

### Invasive Advertisements

The apps and websites that we know and love today say they are free. But with the recent web3 movement users now are starting to understand that it's not. Our online data is being collected and used for marketing purposes. Today, you either have to PAY for your data not to show up in annoying ads covering your screen, or you have to just suffer through it. Even when you opt-out you still get unsolicited suggestions for what you should watch and how you should spend your time.

### Bias and Subjectivity

Who should be able to decide what is misinformation, a handful of puppet masters or the entire user base? Certain groups within society are being silenced and it's clear that it doesn't have to do with facts but more with opinion.

Freedom should be free, not limited or selective.

### Zero Incentive to Engage

User engagement and interaction are precious to media companies, they rely on them. So why don't they reward their users for being dedicated and loyal customers? Doesn't make sense does it, everyday people are leaving their platforms so they can spend their time where they are compensated for their time.

### Enter True Web3 Video

The World's first fully distributed, on-chain, video streaming network. Impossible? Think again.

Kavarii is a decentralized video sharing platform that utilizes NFT & SFT technology, giving content creators complete control and ownership of their content. Built completely on the blockchain with native payments which allow users to tip their favorite creators directly in the browser and require no trusted third party. Users will retain all of their personal data and be able to operate in a 100% ad-free environment.

### True Ownership

Kavarii uses blockchain technology to store all data and content on the platform, and we go one step further by “Minting” each video into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). An NFT is a unique block of data that allows the owner to have complete management control of the data itself, which is tied to their unique address. This allows for easy transfers and offers the owner the ability to take their data with them wherever they please.

### Censorship Resistant

Censorship resistance is a native feature inside Kavarii. A decentralized application (dapp) uses blockchain technology to store all data and content. Blockchains are a distributed ledger of sorts that replace traditional databases by storing bits of the data in multiple locations making it impossible to remove the data as no central point holds or controls the data. Once data or content is uploaded to the blockchain it is publicly available to anyone in the world at any time, making it the most censorship-resistant technology on earth.

There is no ONE person pushing an agenda or opinions. Kavarii is equipped with algorithmic censorship and DAO members that will maintain the integrity of the content. It’s impossible for ANYONE  human to take a video down. Due to the nature of blockchain once it's minted it's tied to the user's unique address on the blockchain forever.

### Reward System and Economics

The third major innovation after the use of NFT technology and proprietary algorithms to achieve decentralization and full ownership of the content for the creator is the social economy aspect of using crypto as our native currency. The KVRI token will be a publicly traded asset that fuels the entire ecosystem and is paid to content creators with each like, subscribe and “Tip” which is unique to the Kavarii platform, hence the audience gets to, truly and directly support its favorite creators.

Unlike traditional social networks, it doesn't take a million views to start earning some real cash. Content creators will earn crypto on their very first like and subscribe.

### 100% AD Free

We will not have any 3rd party ads on the site. Kavarii is a TRUE social-economic platform. There is no need for ads because the protocol is supported by the creators, the creators and supported by their subscribers, and the end users and rewarded through the rewards pool.

### Governance

User ownership is at the heart of everything built on Kavarii. Implementing the Kavarii DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) lets users coordinate decentralized ownership of a platform and make decisions about its future. Like the rest of the platform, the DAO will also be 100% on-chain, immutable, permissionless, and borderless. The main purpose of the DAO will be to decide what content remains on the user interface and what videos are hidden. Collective protection rather than centralized censorship.

The decision to censor a specific video content or not will be taken by the community following the principles of a DAO. A combination of an algorithm that analyzes the ratio between likes, dislikes, and reports will be used to classify content as potentially inappropriate or harmful, and a proposal will be submitted on the DAO for the community to vote if the content should remain or it should be removed, as the platform matures, and the DAO gathers relevant quorum. This will be one of the first actions of the DAO — to define relevant quorum to kickstart and fully release its own powers.

From the start users will be able to report any content and to avoid abuse and misuse of this action, each reporting action will have a fee which will be used to reward the DAO members that will actively take part in content quality control and definition.

### Kavarii Advisory Council  (KAC)

The KAC will operate as a board of directors for the platform, each member will have a say in all aspects of Kavarii with the goal of making it the best possible Video Sharing platform built on the blockchain. There is a maximum of 31 members total in effort to further decentralize the project and it's decisions.

The role of a KAC member is simple: push the platform forward in the best way they can based on their skill set. We aim to create a well-diversified group of people from all backgrounds to get as many different perspectives as possible, with the hopes of being strong across all fronts.

### User Incentives

Kavarii user incentives are a very simple concept, the more time you spend connected and active on the platform the more rewards you will be able to claim. Users can stake their time watching in conjunction with the engagement they've had with the platform to earn rewards from the user rewards pool. This is done to incentivise users for interacting with the content creators.

### SFT's

Because the technology that powers the platform is NFT, it enables interesting use cases such as a built-in stock video market where anyone can choose to enable the buy option for some video content and anyone interested in using that video for marketing materials, within their business or any other use can do so instantly in a few clicks after watching the content. The principle would be similar to “Shutterstock” but for videos.

### Gated Education:

NFT-based diplomas to be issued with personalized traits for participants based on their specific results or for Kavarii to support access to live streamed events based on an NFT ticket.

### Pay-Per-View

The list could go on and based on the feedback from DAO members and creators and their specific content, such as videos, tutorials, documentaries, movies, or others, Kavarii will be flexible with their needs and provide personalized publishing tools which would extend from shared revenue with the users for some content to “pay per view” or others.

### Opt-In Ads

People ask us if Kavarii will be Ad free forever. That is a fantastic question and we will let the community decide. We were thinking about potentially making it similar to the Brave browser in which users opt-in or opt-out of ads. If they opt-in their viewing time will have a greater multiplier yielding them higher rewards.

### Premium Content

Within Kavarii users can subscribe to their favorite creators but we thought we could take it a step further and have users stake with their favorite creators. Users can stake their KVRI tokens directly with the creator. The creators will earn staking rewards based off the amount staked with them and the users will get access to exclusive premium content from the creator.

# Mission

To create a place where video content creators can share their thoughts freely and openly without fear of being silenced. Where creators can be rewarded fairly for their contributions and have full ownership and control over their creations in perpetuity. Where users are celebrated for their engagement and activity.

### Vision

We want to create a video streaming platform for the people. And not just one cohort, demographic, or community but for everyone. Politics, race, geography, and religion aside. Where anyone can come and enjoy unbiased, unfiltered, and unsponsored videos. Nobody has to be a professional to succeed with Kavarii, anyone off the street can become a content creator. You don't need to know anything about blockchain or crypto, you just need to have a passion for decentralization and a fire in your heart.
