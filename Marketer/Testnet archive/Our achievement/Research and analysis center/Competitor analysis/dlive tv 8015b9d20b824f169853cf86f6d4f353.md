# **DLive: its news and ideas**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*y5_fdqgAj4XuQgpO44ubog.png)

My previous [research](https://medium.com/@katerina510/bitchute-video-platform-and-the-lesson-it-can-teach-to-joystream-7ffbcc6eefd) about BitChute revealed that this platform, due to its lack of censorship, has become very popular among far-right, conspiracy-theorists and other extremists. Another example is [dlive](https://dlive.tv/), which appeared in the same year (2017). According to the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center), “DLive has paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to extremists since its founding, largely through donations of cryptocurrency built into a service provided by the site.”Is the only way for decentralized video platforms to survive is to become the refuge for such kind of content creators, or are there other ways? This question really bothers me, and I’ll continue my research.For now, let’s speak about dlive. I’ve already conducted the research of it as a part of my big [research of decentralized platforms](https://medium.com/@katerina510/joystream-vs-other-decentralized-video-platforms-and-youtube-73db4c106431) a year ago. Let’s see what has changed.

## **Social media metrics**

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/OfficialDLive](https://twitter.com/OfficialDLive) 32.3K followers

Community Team Twitter: [https://twitter.com/dlive_community](https://twitter.com/dlive_community), 219 followers (203 a year ago)

Telegram: [https://t.me/DLive_tv](https://t.me/DLive_tv) (abandoned) (88 members a year ago)

Community Telegram: [https://t.me/DLiveApp](https://t.me/DLiveApp) 295 members

Discord: [https://t.co/14mQoRD7wO](https://t.co/14mQoRD7wO) Though it has 17073 members, they are not very active

For example, this post in the announcement channel, tagging everyone, appeared 2 days ago and gained only several reactions:

Other announcements show similar statistics.

The same is true for their official Twitter, which has 32.3K followers, but the same announcement of DLive Stars Reborn gained only 32 likes.

So, social media metrics tell us that though the platform is rather popular (judging by the number of subscribers on social media), the engagement of the audience is very low. It is not good, especially for the video platform which presents itself as the “1st decentralized live streaming platform”.

**Important news**

During this year 2 important news appeared in their [announcement blog](https://community.dlive.tv/category/announcements/).

1). In May 2022 Dlive [announced](https://community.dlive.tv/2022/05/05/dlive-live-streaming-on-mobile/) the launch of the first version of mobile live streaming application for Android and iPhone. You can not only stream directly to DLive with your camera, but can also stream your favourite mobile games.

DLive offers 2 types of mobile streams :

- Games (selecting this option will use your phone screen as the stream input);
- IRL (selecting this option will use either your front or rear cameras as the stream input).

It’s certainly a great feature, congratulations to Dlive!

2). Dlive anounced that it has closed the staking system on September 15, 2022. The system has been used for 3 years to reward BTT (their token) holders. The reason for it is stated [here](https://community.dlive.tv/2022/09/04/btt-staking-to-end-on-september-15th-2022/): “We want to focus on new and exciting options to reward users without the need for them to stake.” The details are yet to be revealed, let’s see what these new options will be.

**What ideas can Joystream borrow?**

1). Dlive has a very good **official merch store**. Here you can buy not only T-shirts, but a lot of other things like tote bags, mugs and even DLive logo luggage. Many other platforms like Bitchute or Odysee do not have it, and I consider it a big omission. Having such a store will certainly be beneficial for marketing, as it can help both in acquiring new users (such merch serves as live advertising when somebody wears it) and in getting more devotion from existing users (people who’ll buy it and use will feel more personal connection to the brand).Another good example of a video platform having a merch store is Theta ([link](https://shop.theta.tv/)). This store is even more interesting, because it has not only Theta-logo-related merch, but also [streamer merch section](https://shop.theta.tv/collections/streamer-merch-1?page=1) with items related to popular streamers on Theta. This is certainly an idea that Joystream should take note of and develop.

2). I also like DLive section [**User Stories**](https://community.dlive.tv/category/user-stories/), where you can read the stories of different streamers, how they got involved in DLive and why do they like it. It adds a good amount of personal touch to the site and inspires new potential streamers to get involved (“If they could make it, why can’t I?”).
