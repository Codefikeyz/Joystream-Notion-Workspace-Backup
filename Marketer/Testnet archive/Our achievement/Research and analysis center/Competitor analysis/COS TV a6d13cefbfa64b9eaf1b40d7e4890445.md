# COS.TV is the first video platform powered by Contentos blockchain

## 1 Description

Contentos is a blockchain protocol that aims to form the foundation for a decentralized digital content ecosystem that empowers all members, including creators, consumers, and advertisers, to earn fair compensation for their contributions. Contentos also intends to establish itself as the future Ethereum of digital content, accepting content DApps of all kinds. Social media offers the opportunity for every user to have a platform dedicated to the promotion of their individual visions of the world at large. The current content ecosystem is run by centralized platforms that depend on advertising for revenue. Content creators are, therefore, pressured to produce content that is approved by advertisers instead of following their creative muses and expressing themselves freely. The constraints inherent to ad-driven content platforms begs the question of just how much freedom of expression is actually allowable. Are these individual influencer world views being traded in for carefully-crafted sponsored content for the masses? Furthermore, when looking at the bottom line, it’s imperative to ask the question, where is the majority of the money going? In the current content system, corporate platforms reap the lion’s share of rewards generated by ad dollars, leaving mere pennies to the influencers whose content the platforms depend on. These tech giants tempt content creators with promises of viable income while exploiting their creations for their own gain. In this model, creators and users lose while the tech platforms flourish at their expense.

The vision of Contentos is to build a "decentralized digital content community that allows content to be freely produced, distributed, rewarded, and traded, while protecting author rights". Contentos strives to incentivize content creation and global diversity and return the rights and value of content to users.

Architecture

Contentos’ technology architecture comprises three layers: the protocol, business, and application layer

Design

1. Contentos supports the distribution of personal digital token assets. Every user may customize their own incentive system to encourage sharing and collaboration.

2. The Contentos team will design cross-link mechanisms for research and development. Currently, many decentralized content communities maintain ecosystems of their own. The Contentos team is dedicated to converging all ecosystems into one and enabling all content communities to interoperate.

3. Contentos will operate inter-blockchain technology on a sidechain while maintaining the original mechanism on its main chain.

4. Currently, the overall blockchain capacity is not suitable for streaming video-related processing and is only capable of simple data storage. Thus, the underlying Contentos blockchain will converge with IPFS-related features to ensure that data is actually stored on the block.

5. With a decentralized digital content community for individuals, teams, and businesses that utilize the Contentos public blockchain, Contentos will provide developers with open access to app development for the Contentos public chain and partner with them to create a robust three-dimensional ecosystem.

*Core feature*

1. Identity authentication: The identity information of every user is recorded in the public chain, and the credibility level of every user is transparent. Identity authentication can span all content communities and products built on the Contentos Public Chain. Even if a community or product is discontinued, authenticated identities will not disappear.

2. Content copyright: The Contentos Public Chain fully records the generation time and transaction time of each creation. Any community user can query the ownership and complete transaction records of every creation through the Contentos open query interface.

3. User credibility: The user credibility system records all evaluation information a user receives on the Contentos Public Chain. The evaluation information and the associated user identity is persistently and irreversibly kept in the Contentos Public Chain, thereby holding all users accountable for their behaviors.

4. Smart contracts: The public chain supports a smart contract mechanism run in the CVM (Contentos Virtual Machine). | White paper 14

5. Storage mechanism: As the technology matures, the Contentos public blockchain will also selectively support upper layer community/product development, directly storing content in specific formats once COS (our native token) is paid.

*Token*

COS is the native token of the Contentos system. COS has more than 100 million potential cold-start users worldwide (refer to Investors and Strategic Partners). 10 billion COS tokens will be issued, which are ERC-20 Token Standard tokens based on the Ethereum protocol. After the release of the native COS token, the exchange rate will be 1:1 (ERC-20 COS token: native COS token). The ecological reward, which constitutes 35% of the total COS token supply, will gradually be released across 12 years. The total COS token supply will remain constant during this 12-year period. Only after the ecological reward has been released completely can BP vote to issue extra tokens, if required by ecosystem development needs then.

To quickly establish the ecosystem during the initial stage and encourage early user adoption, COS tokens will be used to kickstart the ecosystem and reward the contributions made by content creators and users. Users engaging in malicious behaviors will be disqualified from earning rewards. Additionally, in order to promote a certain level of positive engagement, users will need to achieve a minimum credit rating in order to claim their rewards (See “Contentos credit system”). The number of COS tokens users hold determines the final share of rewards distributed to their accounts. Once a sizable user-base is established, users will be able to provide services to earn tokens.

*Rewards*

The 4 billion tokens (i.e. 40% of the total supply) that are allocated for ecosystem operations can be divided into two parts: 3.5 billion is the regular reward to encourage users to participate in the Contentos content ecosystem. 500 million is the kick-start reward, providing the certified DApp developers with rewards for calling users to join Contentos ecosystem. The total number of regular reward tokens is 3.5 billion (i.e. 35% of the total supply), which will be released in 12 years. The annual release amount will increase based on the total number of Contentos users. In the first year, 0.448% of all tokens will be released, and the amount will increase linearly year by year until the release of 5.432% in the 12th year. The gradual release of tokens with reference to user growth will help to stabilize the price of tokens and grant appropriate rewards to early participants. Later participants can still benefit from the distribution of eco-rewards. The Contentos system produces a new block every 3 seconds. When the block is produced, it also releases reward tokens. Taking the first year as an example, when each block is produced, about 4.26 tokens will be released into the reward pool

60% of the regular reward tokens will be used to motivate users to create content and participate in ecosystem operations. Another 30% will be the incentive for block producers. Finally, 10% of the regular reward tokens will be used to reward DApp developers for creating a better user experience and thus attracting more users to join the Contentos ecosystem through the DApp. The reward structure is shown in the figure below.

## 3 Cos.TV

[COS.TV](http://cos.tv/) is the first video platform powered by Contentos blockchainYou can watch your favorite videos here, join this community with your friends, share content, and get COS reward.

Rewards will be distributed in accordance with the quality of content produced, which is determined by the community members. Developers that have created DApps that facilitate the creation of quantity and quality content will earn ecological rewards. The regular ecological reward for a given period is R, the reward for motivating the users is RU, the reward for block producers is RB, and the reward for motivating the DApp developers is RD, then RU = R * 60%, RB = R * 30%, and RD = R * 10%. There is a total of n works produced in this time period, and the positive evaluation received by the i-th work is ci, and the positive evaluation of all works in the cycle is C, that is, C = sum(ci). Then the reward that the creator gets for the period is RU * ci / C. For a DApp, assuming that two works are created on the time period, and the positive evaluations cp and cq are obtained respectively, the DApp creator can obtain the reward RD * (cp + cq) / C

To attract more users to participate in the early stages of Contentos, 500 million tokens (that is, 5% of the total amount) will be offered to the DApp developers recognized by the Foundation to design relevant functions and reward methods to encourage users to join the Contentos ecosystem. These kick-start reward tokens are released year by year in 5 years. Given the total amount of kick-start reward tokens R, the amount of releases in the n-th year is defined to be
