## **$1 Description$**

[**Bastyon](https://bastyon.com/about?id=about-home)** is an innovative social network and video sharing platform. Unlike the mainstream social networks, there is no corporation behind it, it is based on the Bitcoin model. Bastyon is an open source project run by a team of developers and experts, and its goal is to provide a community moderated platform where the freedom of speech is seriously respected.

The project was originally created by Daniel Satchkov, but now encompasses over 25 developers and many volunteers across the globe. Bastyon is more of a protocol than a platform, since any developer can build its own app on it. The platform does not run on a single server but on a network of *user nodes* that are located all throughout the world.

This means that users are always able to get information and communicate, see the content and post as long as they have an internet connection and only a handful of nodes somewhere in the world are operational.

This overcomes the limitations that censors put in place to block or limit communication and spread of information. Information wants to move freely. While, for example, in China some social networks can be used only behind a VPN, there is no need for that with Bastyon.

In addition,Bastyon does not collect personal information: users register without any email or phone number and no personal data like the IP or MAC address are stored in any way. Note, that while Bastyon does not collect any IPs (as can be seen in open code), it is not possible to hide your IP completely when using the internet, unless you are using a VPN.

By doing so,Bastyon enables users to discuss issues freely. Today, anonymity is a requirement for security and privacy and Bastyon is able to guarantee it.

Furthermore, in order to deliver completely private and anonymous communication, Bastyon provides an encrypted chat system, not associated to any phone number or personal data, protected with peer-to-peer encryption model (note, that group chats are not encrypted, only 1-on-1 chats). No one except the two users involved in the chat session can access the messages. All the claims are easy to verify, since Bastyon app and Pocketnet blockchain are both completely open-source, with code visible to everyone. Moreover, all the chat messages are automatically deleted after 7 day.

Bastyon is a censorship-resistant pseudonymous social platform where people can chat, communicate and share contents with others transparent rules that are the same for every user and developer.

## **$2 Interface$**

![unnamed.png](Bastyon%20com%20(9th%20term)/unnamed.png)

The interface of the platform is a typical set of user tools in a modern social network

There are three sections in total:

1 On the left - the control panel, which includes the search bar, content categories, tags, settings, etc.

2 In the middle, of course, the news feed

3 And on the right side is the comments feed.

All sections of this interface are intuitive and in the absence of any significant features do not need a separate description

## **$3 Monetization$**

he basis of the decentralized work of the Bastion platform - its token “Pocketcoin”

You earn PKOIN for votes from users that are active on the platform. So, if you bring over your audience, you will be protected from censorship, while earning for their interaction with your content. Your followers can also add PKOIN to their comments to feature them under your post, 100% of proceeds go to you, because there is no corporate entity.

Also you can earn on Decentilized AdsA decentralized ad marketplace slated for release in December 2021 will allow advertisers to create posts and offer them to bloggers. A blogger can examine the ad post and repost if appropriate. All interactions on bloggers’ channel will go directly to blogger’s wallet, 100% of ad proceeds.

PKOIN has a multitude of uses on Bastyon. First, 50 PKOIN in your account removes all posting limitations and allows you to load video. PKOIN can be used to boost comments, making your comments visible to everyone. The PKOIN from boosted comments goes to the blogger, and bloggers should reply or feature such comments to encourage such boosts. You can boost a post to move it up in the feed. It is used for staking in nodes, you can run a node and earn more PKOIN by staking PKOIN. It will be used in a Decentralized Ad Marketplace with 100% of proceeds going to bloggers. It will also be used to buy special wallpaper profiles, animated profile images etc.

## $4.Advantages$

The Bastion platform has in its slogan a very good idea "WE ARE DRIVEN BY FREEDOM" and the ways that are paved to achieve this goal look very, very attractive - аllowing users to earn 100% of their income on the platform!

Bastyon lets you **s**hare your posts and videos, upload them safely, import them from YouTube (contact us so that we can help!), make sure to let them visible to everyone. Forever. No one will be able to remove or ban them.

Also on their site they declared that  “Bastyon runs  on the blockchain and does not depend on any website or a domain. As long as there are several nodes running somewhere in the world, the network can operate and creators will have access to the followers and users to content. Bastyon is the “Bitcoin of social media”

Looks great and on their GitHub (151 contribution during this year) there is even am instruction for running the node

In general, it is worth admitting that GitHub contains detailed instructions, both technically and on how to work with video hosting

However, despite all the pluses, we must admit that the Pocketcoin token itself as the basis of the Bastyon network technology may be its weak point!

The thing is that the technology of this blockchain itself, most likely, was created directly for building Bastyon platform, which is proved by too detailed information about this token purchase algorithm (several website sections describe this process in the smallest details)

Also there is no information about whether the blockchain passed any audit, and this point is certainly very important!

And of course, the main disadvantage that is clearly glaring is that Bastion is not DAO!

As it seems to me, the ideas and slogans that the platform carries can be fully implemented only in the DAO system, otherwise a number of questions arise:

- What will the platform develop due to, if it promises to give 100% to users?
- Who will stand behind the stage of all Bastion's freedom? A person or a group of people capable of changing those principles at will?
- Who among the authors will need Bastion in the case of inefficient monetization?
- Why there is no widely available information abut *user nodes rewards?*
- How users interesting to runing  nodes?

## **5.Conclusions**

Overall, Bastion is an excellent decentralized platform, with a user-friendly interface and a solid technical and economic foundation. It serves an excellent purpose and seems to be really true to its course.

However, the main problem here is that there are already many platforms like it, and to say that Bastion stands out too brightly among them is probably impossible! Its upgrade is clearly visible in the image of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization on a good base. And that is what can make it stronger than its competitors!
