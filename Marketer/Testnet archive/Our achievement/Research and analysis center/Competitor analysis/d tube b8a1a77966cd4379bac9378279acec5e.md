# **What is DTube?**

DTube is an abbreviation of decentralized tube. It is a decentralized video platform built on top of the steem blockchain and the IPFS service. Like YouTube, you can watch videos on DTube. There are no major differences in watching experience. But the technology and idea behind DTube are quite different from YouTube.
Using the Avalon Blockchain as a database
Because  D.Tube team want  to be truly decentralized, they cannot have a server running a database and use it to query things. And the natural solution was  Using Avalon blockchain. It is fast . It is free, anyone can use it without having to deposit some form of currency, and transactions have no fees. Who would want to pay money to upload a video, comment a video, or even upvote? Nobody. Any video uploaded on D.Tube becomes an Avalon content, that can earn rewards also you can post your content to Steem and Hive blockchains and benefit from interoperable features of Dtube.
Using IPFS as a static file storage
IPFS is a protocol that enables decentralized file storage. The principle behind it is called Distributed Hash Tables (DHT). The same principle also powers the BitTorrent network. Just like how cryptocurrency uses asymmetrical cryptography, DHT networks will hash contents in order to be able to identify a file. The hash becomes the identifier of a file, and it's as easy as re-hashing a file and making sure the hashes match to ensure the file that was sent to us is the original.
Why not use Torrent then? Torrent arguably already has more content and is more mainstream. However, Torrent was not built for the web. Some implementations such as WebTorrent are trying to make it work, but it still requires some 'hybrid' clients that would act as bridges in order to transfer files from hard clients such as μTorrent to web clients that run in a browser. Not very convenient, even less efficient. I am sure a lot of you have used PopcornTime to watch some 'pirated' content and have enjoyed it, but building something similar that runs inside a browser without having to run hybrid clients to connect people, is sadly impossible. IPFS is a younger, open-source, and actively developed protocol. It has a bright future ahead. Using it as the main mean of storage for this project was a no-brainer.`
DTube is the hot, new video platform that pays you to post videos! DTube is also de-centralized which means you will not experience the DE-monetization that YouTube is doing because DTube is NOT advertising based. Now you can earn money JUST by uploading videos to this new platform

# Interface

The user interface is simple and straightforward. At first glance it is very reminiscent of YouTube (in the early stages)
When you click on the selected file, a video track opens with a similar interface to YouTube and similar features (subtitles, acceleration, download quality)
Video uploading and channel creation are available after registration

# Tokenomics

DTC is a utility token created to serve best to video content creators , you can use it to post, vote or tag and promote videos on Dtube platform. You can hold your DTC to generate VP (Voting Power). Each unit of DTC produces for its holder +1 unit of VP per hour You can spend your VP by tagging some content or use it to curate others content to get DTC from curation rewards, the more VP spent on these actions will generate more and it will have more impact on content exposure You can also burn DTC to promote your videos all the DTC used in this process will be burned which means it will be deleted from the circulating supply and it will increase the scarcity of DTC. Promoting content will provide more exposure and that may lead to getting more rewards on the video - if it is proved to be a successful piece of content.
Curation and reward mechanics
You earn rewards by curating or getting curated, there are 3 important indicators in this game. How many people voted before and after you, time passed after published content and the amount of VT you spend to vote. You can generate rewards in Dtube without any time boundries, however inbetween 1 and 3.5 days after publication period you get double curation rewards which makes it most optimal time to curate video content. The important part is the votes you receive after your vote if community decides its a good content and votes it before you the rewards you earn increases.The more VT you spend on a vote generates more DTC.
You can claim your rewards whenever you want
After 7 days period you can either wait your curation or video content to generate more rewards or you can click claim from rewards page, however when you click claim you won't be able to generate infinite rewards for that vote or content. This 7 day period is really essential for healthy economy and it gives opportunity to community to act to bad actors with downvotes. Downvotes is a great way for community to moderate content and you can delete rewards from the most recent upvoters with a downvote.

# Censorship and moderation

Because of the decentralized nature of IPFS and the Avalon blockchain, D.Tube is not able to censor videos, nor enforce guidelines. Only the users can censor it, through the power of their upvotes and downvotes. IPFS is a protocol that enables decentralized file storage. The principle behind it is called Distributed Hash Tables (DHT). The same principle also powers the BitTorrent network. Just like how cryptocurrency uses asymmetrical cryptography, DHT networks will hash contents in order to be able to identify a file. The hash becomes the identifier of a file, and it's as easy as re-hashing a file and making sure the hashes match to ensure the file that was sent to us is the original. This technology makes your content truely immutable.

### **Community self-moderation**

In a world of disinformation and algorithmic moderation, community ranking proved the most accurate mechanism to rate and organize any kind of information on the web (restaurants, real estate, movies, etc.) With Avalon, content is ranked exclusively by user’s upvotes, downvotes and tags. A popular piece of content (i.e. with lots of upvotes) goes up in its category to gain more exposure and a submission with a negative score is automatically hidden. Adult content is tagged “NSFW” and hidden by default (an account is required to view this content); All platform moderation guidelines come from a community consensus.
