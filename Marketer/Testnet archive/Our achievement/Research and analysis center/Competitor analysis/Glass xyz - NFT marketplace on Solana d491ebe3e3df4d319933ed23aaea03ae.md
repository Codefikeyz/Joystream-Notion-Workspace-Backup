Glass is a decentralized video platform/protocol with transparent monetization, which allows users to create NFTs from their videos and sell them. According to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/glass-08c0), the organization was founded in 2021. It is headquartered in the USA (Lewes, DE). 

**Technology**

Blockchain: previously Ethereum, moved to Solana in September 2022. (They found that the main issues were cost, speed and the user experience (UX) on Web3. By their move into the Solana network, they have addressed these issues en-masse. [link](https://arweave.news/glass-video-nft-platform-moves-to-solana/))
According to their finding posted on Twitter, buying an NFT on Glass while still on the Ethereum network cost the buyer $2.50-$50, while utilising the Solana network means that that is reduced to just 0.04731 cents. As for the content creators, creating a video now costs $2-3 compared to the previous $25-200 that they would have to spend on Ethereum gas fees. Purchasing a video NFT on a Solana-based Glass means that the transaction now finalises in just a few seconds. Ethereum transactions on the other hand can take much longer (minutes-hours).

File storage: Arweave, which means videos can’t be deleted once uploaded. They will be there forever, even if Glass shuts down their support altogether.
Transcoding: Transcoding is done via Livepeer

More information about technology can be found [here](https://glass.mirror.xyz/9ZFAFqvt-3PA9d1NXDD5TT1nX5J4mQdVriP1KFxBZXM).

Glass has partnered with Zora ([the announcement](https://glass.mirror.xyz/Hg6kamoFnNRRASslg9c4JviHaHpxbFSL4nN3Y98QcZk)), which allows it to use Zora’s Auction House. The process is the following: 

1. A creator uploads their video on Glass.
2. Glass turns the giant raw video file into a super fast, playable format, stored permanently on Arweave.
3. The creator mints their video as an NFT on Glass, using Zora’s open NFT contract.
4. The creator approves and puts their video up for auction on Glass, using Zora’s open Auction House contract.
5. The video NFT is up for auction. Collectors can bid on it on both Glass and Zora.

**Audience and scale**

From the very beginning, they’ve been focused on music videos. Their first ever Glass NFT was a music video ([link](https://glass.mirror.xyz/Hg6kamoFnNRRASslg9c4JviHaHpxbFSL4nN3Y98QcZk)). According to [this article](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/27/exclusive-nft-video-platform-glass-raises-5m-led-by-tcg), Glass currently works with around 120 creators. I could actually find only 8 on their site, so I don’t know where this number came from. Probably it is related to their previous Ethereum [platform](https://eth.glass.xyz/). They’ve just started on the new website and Solana network (moved here in the end of September). According to [their Twitter](https://twitter.com/glassprotocol/status/1576972883363909633), they gained 100 collectors in the first week - rather good start! They will continue to host eth glass. In the future they hope to bridge these communities.
Let’s look at some statistics of their new Solana platform. The numbers for the last week, according to the [cofounder’s Tweet](https://twitter.com/sam_sends/status/1579193406277853185): 

TOTAL VOLUME: 294.04 SOL (⬆ 196%)
TOTAL SALES: 460 (⬆ 191%)
COLLECTORS: 124 (⬆ 24%)
You can also see the daily statistics on the main page of glass.xyz. Here, at the very top of the page, you’ll see 24H volume, total volume, 24H sales, total sales, creators, collectors and videos for the day. 
For example, today’s statistics (10.10.2022):
24H VOLUME:**0.00 SOL**
TOTAL VOLUME:**294.04 SOL**
24H SALES:**0**
TOTAL SALES:**460**
CREATORS:**8**
COLLECTORS:**124**
VIDEOS:**9**

As you can see, the scale is not impressive yet. There are only 8 creators. The platform is actually just starting its journey. Currently, Glass.xyz is very selective with what is being released on the platform. According to [this article](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/what-is-glass-xyz), this is due to the fact it’s a relatively new platform, and the Glass team wants to ensure the platform is optimized before the creator function is released to the general public.

**How to become a creator/collector**

To be a Creator or Collector, you must connect to a browser extension called Phantom. Phantom is an electronic wallet that lets you purchase, store, and engage in transactions using the native Solana cryptocurrency, SOL. All transactions on the Platform are in the native Solana cryptocurrency, SOL.
As of today, video creators need an invitation to become a creator on the platform. If you want to apply to be a creator on Glass, join their discord, dm one of the core members, and fill out the “create” form on the website’s homepage (Typeform application). 

**Terms and conditions for creators**

Glass offers a marketplace for videos, and the platform allows users to collect videos, but they do not buy, sell, or ever take custody or possession of any video.

Creators are offered the option of selling the NFT as a one-of-one or as a series. If the one-of-one option is selected, then the creator can hold an auction for the NFT. The auction starts with the first bid; once the first bid is placed, there is 24 hours left in the auction. The creator determines the minimum (reserve) price, which is the starting rate, and then each bid thereafter must be at least 5% higher than the previous bid. 

Once the auction is complete, 90% of the profit immediately goes to the creator’s wallet (if using ETH blockchain / 97.5% if using SOL blockchain), and the remaining percentage goes to the Glass treasury. The Glass treasury is dedicated to future production and promotion of the platform, which is inherently a beneficial practice for the creators within. The platform plans on soon making fees for Solana drops [less than 2.5%](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/what-is-glass-xyz). 

**Branding**

Their branding is modest, but I found some interesting details. They have a [Manifesto](https://glass-manifesto.super.site/), which aims to attract creators to join the platform. The main idea is that on Glass, videos are owned by people, not the platform. The interesting part of Manifesto is that Youtube and other centralized platforms rely on ads revenue model. “The Ads model has made it so we're **forced** to care more about the hype from views than we care about **making great videos”.** 
Glass gives the power to creators:

> 
> 
> 
> And when you sell it to fans, you get paid directly and they get to have a representation of their love for your video. It's not about getting views anymore. It's about who views your video and how much they love what you do.
> 

They emphasize the idea of transparency in their branding (*... as transparent as GLASS.)* This idea is embedded into their name (Glass) and into their logo (play button on a transparent glass-like background). 
I also liked the [Terms](https://glass-terms.super.site/) page, specifically, their attempt to make this boring document more personal and *transparent.* 

> Transparency is super important to Glass. So we really appreciate your diligence in checking out these Terms of Use (the “Terms”). We worked hard to make them as easy as possible for you to understand.

They added a smile to the text and made a good attempt to simplify it.
