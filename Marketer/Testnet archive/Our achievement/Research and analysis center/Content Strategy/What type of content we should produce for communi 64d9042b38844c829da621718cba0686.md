**What kind of content should we produce for the community?**

The direction of content production is one of the most important directions in the current and forthcoming cycle of development of the decentralized Atlas media platform, and consequently the Joystream platform as a whole!

Of course, at the moment we have a state of affairs in which the community encourages the uploading of any content to the Atlas video platform. And right away I would like to say that this principle should be further developed without changes! After all, first and foremost, we need to;

Continue to test how Atlas works, figuring out bugs and problems related to updates

Scale up Atlas, filling it with as much content as possible.

It's no secret that for many current community members uploading videos to Atlas was one of the very first and easiest experiences of working on Joystream.

Potential builders of DAO come to Joystream after hearing about its product and the first thing they do is try it out. Experiment with creating their own content. They upload videos from other services and of course, we should develop and encourage this process!

However, If we seriously talk about a strategy for developing Atlas as a competitive product in the media platform market, we should of course seriously think about some kind of initial plan to create "content that is in demand and attractive to users".

One thing to note here. During the period of Giza updates, Joystream members were also seriously concerned about this issue and repeatedly proposed solutions and directions for creating a certain direction of content for uploading to Atlas video hosting.

The basic idea behind those suggestions was the following;

"To attract an initial core audience, we need to develop content direction on Atlas that people with specific interests would be interested in and would be happy to come to Atlas rather than anywhere else.

Well, those good thoughts are still valid. Plus, today we have serious updates, allowing content creators to convert their videos into new products. So let's try to set a vector, and isolate the categories and topics of content, which will make Atlas happy and will attract a lot of new users to Joystream!

**1) Learning is always relevant!**

Many of the old-timers remember Bounty 26, the creation of educational content offered by @Swasilenko.

Unfortunately, at the time this bounty was not implemented, but in its basis it had a very effective message!

"A huge number of users of ideohostingov today go there to see educational videos".

How to make Osobuco?

How do you become a programmer?

How to build your own DAO?

Millions of relevant questions will always be in demand and there will always be an audience where the answer lies! So why don't we create conditions for uploading video tutorials and other learning materials to the atlas?

**2) Crypto, crypto and crypto again!**

All of us who are reading this article at this moment have something to do with the world of cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies have brought us to Joystream, through a long corridor of questions, answers, news, soliloquies and gossip that are literally hanging in the air today labeled "Crypto World".

The interest in this topic around the world is enormous and attracting authors capable of creating content on this topic will be a huge success!

**3) Joystream is independent!**

Joystream platform builds a product of web 3. The main objective of which is equality, equity and independence!

And these are the qualities that must be present in the content that should be uploaded on Atlas.

Independent political views and opinions.

Sensitive social topics

Investigations of white-collar crimes

Free people manifestos and any expressions of will by any groups or minorities, should make Joystream its safe haven and realize the full potential of our platform!

Of course, we must be fully aware that Joystream is in a test phase and everything must be done with the utmost care!

Any political statements may have negative reactions from the governing bodies of different countries (especially now). And in certain locations this can lead to a ban of the platform, which is certainly not desirable.

Therefore, it would be logical to break this goal into several stages, with strict initial moderation and synchronization with the stages of adoption of web 3 technologies in general, on a global scale!

**4) Everybody wants a NFT!**

Congratulations friends!

Joystream is already among the first!

Yes, among the first in the world, Joystream team implemented the possibility of releasing a video nft tied to your videos on a video platform!

It works!

So let's soon take advantage of it and attract those who need it in the first place. Creators of such content who need this service;

- unique, collectible content
- training, paid courses
- Influencers with an effective audience, willing to try a new way to monetize
- film industry and TV series
