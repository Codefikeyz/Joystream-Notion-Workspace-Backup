Nowadays, the marketing strategies of almost all blockchain projects are similar to each other. This is not surprising and not a bad thing. It's just that during those short years in which cryptocurrencies are marching in the modern world, the rapidly developing market of crypto projects has already managed to develop reliable patterns of successful marketing in the development of its product. And they all essentially boil down to one goal

“Creating a loyal community” - nothing is more important     than people who are ready to use the product being created!

This is the most important and initial point of any marketing campaign and for this resource there is a daily battle between teams and adepts of different startups, which we see in our Discord servers, Twitter and Telegram channels, YouTube recomendations

The most successful projects in the web3 space have one thing in common: a strong, loyal community.

Whether you’re building a [DAO](https://www.uxsequence.io/learn/article/a-guide-to-daos/), [DeFi](https://www.uxsequence.io/learn/article/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/) platform or [NFT](https://www.uxsequence.io/learn/article/5-reasons-why-nfts-will-boom/) project, you’re tasked with creating a community amongst an audience that doesn’t just want to buy your product, but instead wants to contribute, be involved and be invested in your project.

Of course, let's not live with rose-colored glasses and be crypto realists. Let's admit that in addition to creating a truly engaged community, any blockchain project involves in its orbit users pursuing short-term commercial interest. And it can be both simple crypto hamsters hoping to get a drop of a couple hundred for silly tweets, and large investment funds, the so-called Clippers, initially aiming to make X's on your token listing and go on, not caring about your future at all.

But guess what? It's not bad in principle. In crypto, you have to take it as a fact and benefit even from that side of the coin!

So, now let's move on to the tools.

And in fact, the entire available set of marketing tools in cryptoprojects serving this main goal is focused on it and in some way specific,like:

- airdrops

One of the best ways to get your project off the ground is to offer an incentive to those that are the first to support you.

One of the simplest ways you can do this is through your pricing strategy.

One of the simplest ways you can do this is through your pricing strategy.

Let’s look at the original mint prices of some of the most successful NFT projects.

[Doodles](https://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official) originally cost [0.123ETH](https://nftnow.com/guides/doodles-guide/#:~:text=17%2C%202021%2C%20originally%20pricing%20their,initial%20treasury%20of%20~420%20ETH.), A [Bored Ape](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) cost their first owners [0.08ETH](https://cryptopotato.com/the-mind-blowing-roi-of-minting-and-holding-a-bored-ape-nft-from-the-beginning/) and [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) famously cost [nothing but gas](https://www.infostor.com/nft-projects/cryptopunks-nft-mint-price-rarity-top-sales-volume-updated/) to mint. All went on to achieve roaring success within the NFT space.

But, Don’t let your project become a closed shop. If you’re only rewarding the first 1000 members of your community, how will your community ever grow above 1000?

Reward your token holders permanently!

- incentivise testnets

The field is truly limitless (especially if you have a product that's in demand and working)

Testing, collaborations, contests, content creation. Sometimes, in the most competent projects, testnets and Ambassador programs replace a whole marketing strategy to promote the project in social networks, and it's really cool!

- whitepaper/litepaper/roadmap

Nothing attracts the potential consumer as a good white paper, in which he can see in the palm of his hand what can be expected from the project, how interesting and honest it is, how long his story will last and, accordingly, his relationship with the project?

- ico/ido

Here, of course, any project will count on the infusion of high-profile funds, which is already good publicity, which works in 100 cases out of 100

Also, make sure you’re integrating strategies that have stood the test of time rather than replacing them. This includes: content marketing, PR, social media marketing, SEO strategies, influencer marketing and so on.(And of course, I will not take a lot of time to explain the importance of discord and twitter in this direction, because you know it yourself)

In general, we can say that the effective marketing strategies of blockchain projects is a cumulative set of standard tools serving a single purpose, the creation of a community around the project.

And the successful application of these tools depends entirely on such factors as:

- The professionalism of the project team
- marketability of the product
- the situation in the cryptocurrency market
- Relevance to current trends in cryptocurrency
- integrity
- ability to play the long game
