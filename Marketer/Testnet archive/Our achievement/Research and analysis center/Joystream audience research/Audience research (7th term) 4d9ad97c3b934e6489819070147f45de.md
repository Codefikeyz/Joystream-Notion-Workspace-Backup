As we can see in [https://github.com/Joystream/marketing/issues/171](https://github.com/Joystream/marketing/issues/171)

Joystream has 4 different audiences in the timeline;

- DAO contributors
- Video content creators
- Token investors
- Dapp builders

With regard to the first point, quite a lot of information. Repeatedly, JSG gave an explanation about the fact that at this stage of platform development, Joystream needs, first of all, participants interested in the development of DAO tools. The platform really needs people who are able to take the responsibility of management in their own hands when the main network is launched.

Accordingly, the target audience for Joystream marketing was determined.

In the meantime, we're getting closer to mainnet and it would be important to define the portrait of target audience which is next in line

"Video content creators."

Because one of the main products of Joystream is Atlas video platform, the project is directly interested in attracting the creators of content in large quantity and of high quality!

It would be logical to assume that the audience that comes after content creators is inextricably linked to them, which in turn would be a direct sign of Joystream mass adopts in the melia platforms market.

According to these statements, it is possible to define a portrait( characteristics) of content creators needed Joystream:

- **Experience**

Obviously, bloggers and teams with experience on other video hosting platforms are much faster and more successful in adapting to the Atlas platform.

However, at the same time, this does not mean that Joystream is not interested in creators without experience! Atlas can also position itself as an experimental platform for young and new content creators, which in turn can attract an additional audience to Joystream.

- **Audience**

Creators with their audience and arbitrators who can transfer target audiences from other platforms are also seen as a very attractive target!

- **Subject**

As already said CMO on one of the AMA's earlier. The most likely users of Atlas are bloggers and their audience interested in cryptocurrencies and you can't disagree with that!

Obviously, Joystream as a platform in general and Atlas as its product, are the real product of web 3 era. Accordingly, those adepts of these technologies who accept and wait for them, most of them are obviously interested in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains and with great interest will get into and use the Joystream platform.

The good news is that there are more and more of them now.

For example, there is a huge amount of creators in YouTube at the moment making content about cryptocurrencies, and some of them have already started to use Atlas as an alternative video hosting!

It is in our power to strengthen this positive trend!
