These two resources are not chosen by chance, but as aggregators of the most interesting cryptocurrency events. Other resources available in the search engines of the most common browsers reflect almost identical information

So, based on this data we can summarize the data on the countries with the largest number of crypto events;

1st place, out of competition USA

2 UAE

3 Spain and Portugal

5 Turkey

6 Japan

Also, on the European continent we cannot ignore such old crypto hubs as

Estonia

Ukraine

and France

Quite active development of cryptocurrencies and related events take place in Russia and India And despite the fact that in mid-March 2022 India announced the introduction of taxes on income from cryptocurrencies and NFT, the country still has a huge potential in the development of crypto and startup projects in this area
