# How to categories youtube influencers and how to outreach them

YouTube is currently one of the most popular media platforms in the world

It's not a secret that they have the largest audience of all existing video platforms today, and accordingly they have the largest base of video bloggers and advertisers working directly with video content!

Accepting this fact, we must also admit that one of the hottest trends and topics of the past few years, and not only in YouTube (here only as a consequence) but in the whole media space is the topic of cryptocurrencies! This topic excites and causes interest of tens of millions of people, this area is constantly evolving and threatens to change many things in our usual world and therefore it is not surprising that a huge stratum of developers who place their content on the YouTube service work exactly in the crypto

And here we come to some paradox. The fact is that one of the directions that the crypto sphere is now intensively changing and developing is Web 3. Internet where the user will be an equal part of the relationship with large services and companies, just like YouTube. And some of the most popular Web 3 products currently under development are those same video services, but decentralized, with complete Web 3 principles that will be independent of advertisers, state and political censorship and allow users to earn money not only from their creativity but also from the participation in the service.

Thus bloggers use the resource of YouTube - as the most popular video service today - to inform about its growing and direct competitors from the decentralized world, capable of destroying or simply absorbing it in the long term. Isn't that funny?

However it may happen, it will probably not happen soon, and the interest in such projects among the audience is definitely there, and every self-respecting project that builds decentralized video platform (and not only) should understand that YouTube, as the source of popularity of the entire video content industry of today, is the root system on which it can grow the fruits of decentralization!

And that's why working with YouTube resources as a part of marketing campaign of any decentralized video platform is very important and preferable. After all, this is where the future potential audience of these services is, who are already watching with interest the stories of their favorite crypto-bloggers about web 3 video platforms!

So, from here we set the challenge:

Determine the ways to outreach youtube influencers who are in blockchain even slightly

But before identifying ways to engage, let's classify all the bloggers on our list by some traits for a more effective approach

Categories:

Classification of YouTube Influencers:

1 By location (language affiliation)

Obviously, the most logical distribution of Influencers, through which it will be possible to disseminate information about Joystream, will be their classification according to language and location.

The most logical distribution is the determination of language communities which have the largest and most active audience of crypto-enthusiasts;

- English speaking audience ( Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, India)
- Russian speaking segment ( CIS countries )
- Chinese language
- Indian language

2 By number of subscribers

Here it would make sense to divide the list into 4 groups:

- Influencers with an audience of more than 1 million
- from 500 thousand to 1 million
- from 100 to 500 thousand
- less than 100 thousand

3 According to the cost of advertising

This item is the last because it logically follows from the previous two. There will undoubtedly be a correlation between geography and the size of a particular blogger's channel.

Obviously, a blogger with audience size of 500k from CIS and USA will have different advertisement cost.

Just like the price of advertising will be different for a blogger of millionaires and a channel with 30k subscribers from one country

Ways:

Here, the most likely and effective way to contact the Influencers we are interested in is direct contact via social media!

Almost all bloggers broadcasting in popular media sources have links to their social networks, emails and other contacts necessary for business relations

To do this;

1) From our list, copy the link to the Influencer's YouTube channel

2) Go to YouTube, in the About section.

3) Under About, click on the link to mail and send a presentation or formal letter

[](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F79xQKYmvmGmbRHXD8yf-KubCSydpVkAQ6uISt00uL8u4TGiR0G5cgGKdZ72GS7Q9jg66sLkgd-yy5zR-EIBrs9aJKEQvSGFgRTgLl6vBuMJhYtU0ho9Nuiz35eM2YjpapDTXxurQyYC7Nkz76vcGXw)

4) If the section does not specify a blogger's e-mail, it will be 100% specified on his social networks: Twitter, Telegram, Instagram

[](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QzlhbxmovuJlPIyk4JKnDVe3bUPu4dHdy9XELqnaXDYHkV9EvycKBc_wm7KrrOKvhxa-VnUGoggAjHQSMcxKzDzxf9HbDGFcFyM26TiPNccaaZkzsKNDlPY5cBOTuNSjoGE3WVG-KRBVoGjcNEYMTbs)

In that case, you should get in touch with the blogger via these channels.

Besides the direct message in your personal message, you can also think about the strategy of ubiquitous subscription.

In this case, besides a presentation to the post (as an example), we subscribe to the blogger in all his media channels and social networks, thus constantly being in his field of attention!

The more information Influnrs have about Joystream, the more they will be interested in our product.

We would like to see Joystream as a product represented everywhere, in all social networks and platforms and interaction with friendly Influencers would be a very good way of achieving this!
