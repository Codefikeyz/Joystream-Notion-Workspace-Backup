# Most effective launchpads  in polkadot ecosystem

![polka.png](Most%20effective%20launchpads%20in%20polkadot%20ecosystem/polka.png)

No doubt we are all familiar with the Polkadot ecosystem and its possibilities!

The main feature of this ecosystem is, of course, cross platforming, with extensive interoperability of various functional blockchains based on Polkadot parachain

In this regard, this ecosystem is the most promising in terms of functionality development and various areas of the crypto market

And of course, it would be strange not to have polkadot blockchain-based proprietary lunchpad platforms that would allow users to invest in various crypto projects at their early stages

Today we will try to introduce you to two of the most popular such platforms

# **PolkaStarter**

Polkastarter, founded at the end of 2020, is undoubtedly the leading Polkadot blockchain-based launchpad.

The Polkastarter platform has great promise, given that it has attracted more than 200,000 enthusiastic investors.

Polkastarter is a fast-growing decentralized exchange built on the Polkadot network for token pools and auctions.

Polkastarter serves as a decentralized crowdfunding platform for early-stage crypto projects to raise capital, expand their reach, build a dedicated community and access the benefits of the platform.

**Largest IDOs on Polkastarter**

Since Polkastarter's launch, there have been over 40 token seals. Among them are such well-known projects as Blockchain Cuties, Convergence, Fire Protocol, and Ethermoon.

NFT-platform Ethernity Chain showed the highest growth. At its peak, its token was 272 times the price of a sale. Due to the growing popularity of the non-interchangeable token sphere, other NFT-related services started to take off.

Super farm, in which users deploy crypto farms, brought investors up to x190. A capitalization of $273 million was achieved in just 14 days after the launch.

Polkamon made the luckiest investors 185 times richer. The market capitalization after the token sale reached $55 million

The following tokens showed strong growth after the listing:

Room - x92;

UMB - x52;

Exeed Me - x37;

BFLY - x23;

Bridge Mutual - x19;

Shift - x15.

Polkastarter leverages the full capabilities of Polkadot , including the liquidity of Ethereum and other leading crypto projects.

Many of the platform's potential features are related to its crosschain development. The PolkaStarter platform is designed to enable projects to launch their own compatible token pools.

With leading platforms such as Ethereum and Bitcoin still struggling with network congestion, the Polkadot ecosystem and Polkastarter platform could be very useful and beneficial for future projects.

Moreover, the Polkastarter protocol is fully decentralized. The platform is open source and has a permission-free environment.

This means that any developer can integrate the basic structure of Polkastarter into their own project to create and run fixed token auctions.

The first rounds of investment raised $875,000 from Signum Capital, Astronaut Capital, Moonrock Capital, and NGC Ventures. The IDO process raised $20 million. The company held it on September 30 on Uniswap. As a result, the price of the POLS utility token soared 750% (from $0.05 to $0.9). MahaDAO and SpiderDAO launched on December 15, the first token sales on Polkastarter.Polkastarter opened on a cryptocurrency tablet screen.

The main advantages over competitors are as follows.

Fixed swap pools instead of Automated Market Maker protect new tokens from volatility at launch.

Fast and cheap cross-network swaps (supported by Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Polygon).

Password-protected private exchange transactions.

Discounts for white list buyers.

Dutch and private auction features available in pools.

Classic crowdfunding option.

KYC integration.

Polkastarter also has its own service token called the POLS token.

**POLS tocenomics**

POLS is a site utility token. Used on Polkastarter for the following operations.

Stacking. Users are rewarded for locking the token in pools.

Liquidity Mining. Earnings from blocking a token in exchange pools on secondary markets.

Managing the platform through participation in voting. Commissions, new site features, adding tokens to the network are on the agenda.

Paying transaction fees.

Receiving allocation in pools for POLS holders. The more tokens a user locks into the protocol, the more new coins he can buy.

A total of 100 million POLS were issued, which were distributed as follows:

15% - redeemed by seed investors,

5% - for private seals,

5% - allocated for liquidity fund (support on other exchanges),

10% - for the team members,

10% - to the investment fund,

15% - for ecosystem development (PR, marketing, partnerships, etc.).

The remaining 40% was redeemed as part of the IDO. In March 2021, the coin was listed on Binance.

# **Polkapad Platform**

A launchpad, also referred to as a “Launch Platform” is a digitally-based infrastructure enabling users to find and join the best startups in a network. In other words, it is a community-building tool.

With regards to blockchain projects, launchpads enjoy the security and efficiency of a trustless, distributed framework – protection from corruption risks, forced shutdowns, and security breaches.

launchpads are very beneficial for entrepreneurs. They provide infrastructure and potential audiences for their projects. You don’t have to build infrastructure around your pitch from scratch, and you can see how the community reacts to your idea. You are using an established marketplace, thus limiting your expenditures on marketing. You can compare Launchpad to the Agora in Ancient Greece – a place where one could trade goods or make a public speech.

Talking about it really needs a series of separate articles, containing a bunch of awfully complex terms such as ‘DAO’, ‘layers of communication’, ‘XCMP’ etc. We aim to build a sort of Borgesian library of blockchain in time, but we can’t get into minute details here. So we will give you essentials about 3 existing types of Launchpads:

1. 1. Stand-alone (AKA community first): This launchpad is designed for projects with an existing community presence.
2. 2. Industry-specific: In short, such Launchpad allows the creation of new blockchains through funding from investors.
3. 3. Monochain: This type of Launchpad helps developers to build projects which are extensions of the existing core chain.

One of the major issues surrounding existing crypto launchpads is the disproportionate accumulation of ownership. In most allocations top 100-300 users hold from 80 to 98% of all stakes (and less than 600 can participate at all). That’s both economically unjust and technologically inefficient. Such distribution barely responds to the needs of network decentralization.

On the Polkapad platform, every participant has a power metric. The bigger it is the more allocation the user gets. The platform has a set of policies and incentives (it’s a very long list), and the ultimate goal is to create benefits for those holding stakes — the longer users hold stakes, the greater their allocation.

In the end, the Polkapad staking solution is beneficial for both creators and community members. The former gets a community that keeps the project’s interests at heart, while the latter gets dedicated developers who seek to work on projects long-term.

This will result in the influx of new users and creators to the platform, to the benefit of all parties.

he best way to describe the operational usability of Polkapad is to use the much-hyped word “multiverse”. Your project becomes available to people worlds away from you! That dramatically increases your audience-building opportunities.

Since Polkapad builds on a big Polkadot community, including devoted fans with established backgrounds in crypto and blockchain (such as Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood), you start on a strong foot. As of now, Polkapad platform offers you a huge active community to help you develop your products and scale up your dApp.

our community benefits from money saved on implementing a marketing campaign. Polkapad will relieve you of much of your marketing costs, leaving you with some spare change to spend on boosting the engagement of your existing community. Why spend $30 on Google Ads promotion when you can simply offer it directly to your future user?

Polkapad helps to make this transaction secure:

- – Community of real users (no multi-accounts, fake documents, etc)
- – Community of active blockchain users
- – Community of users interested in your project.

# Soon

We can also add that some launchpad sites have announced their work on the polkadot network, for example

### Finminity

Finminity's investor and token community services are provided by Polkadot for the Know Your Business (KYB) process, DAO, staking, voting and governance.

### Or Red KIte.

Red Kite is one of the recent entrants to the startup market and IDO.
It shows good results and helps new crypto projects get the launch they want.
Red Kite helps investors participate in transparent token sales for new crypto projects.
It will soon support Polkadot and will be the first platform in the Polkadot network with flexible pool types and whitelisting conditions.

We can safely say that the polkadot system is interesting to investors and will continue to attract and develop this direction
