# Go-To-Market Strategy

Having spoken to a lot of web3 founders in the last few months, and studying successful launches, it’s my opinion that there are a few fundamentals that successful projects have in common, paired with solid growth marketing campaigns.

In this document I’m going to outline what I believe are some of those foundations, as well as growth marketing campaigns that have shown great results.

## Messaging

When you boil it down, the primary target audiences Joystream is attempting to solve problems for comes down to a) video creators and b) developers who want to create video-focused applications.

From my point of view, there’s actually very little interaction with both these groups of people. Of course, there’s only 24 hours in the day and reaching mainnet with the existing scope is the biggest challenge at the moment. This being said, I think it’s important to do much better on this front, because speaking to your target audience is where you learn the important details that allow you to course correct accurately. Otherwise you might end up in an echo chamber full of people that have nothing to do with the core problem you’re solving.

Quick example to drive this point home: as a marketing consultant in web3 I was communicating quite broadly using the term “crypto marketing”. After having about 10 consultations with web3 founders I realized they were all struggling with go-to-market strategy specifically, which is a much more specific subset of “crypto marketing”.

My “crypto marketing” video on Youtube has 5.5% click through rate, and once I had this realization from my audience I made a video and put “crypto go-to-market strategy” in the title. That video has 12-13% CTR, because I noticed patterns from my talks with founders, and leaned into the thing they all wanted.

It’s my opinion that explicit effort should go into finding and speaking to video creators and developers who want to, or already are, building video applications, in order to gather more data.

## Vision

Bedeho has written the manifesto which details the Joystream vision. We heard from several people that this document had a big impact in their desire to participate in the project, which is a great sign. 

In my opinion, there are 2 issues with the current manifesto:

1) The structure of the page is not good. The flow of information made it tough to comprehend, primarily based on how the designer structured everything.

2) The language is very sophisticated. This is fine for the manifesto, but a simple-to-digest version would be useful, as one sentence that communicates the vision. This is by far the best example in crypto: [https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1290058248347770880](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1290058248347770880)

Also, in the future it would be nice to have a short video explaining the vision, that can be passed around by friends to do the “pitching” for us.

## Community

Have written and made videos about the fact that the foundation of a community comes from the fact that the people in the community share a core desire. A group of people in the same Discord is not a community, it’s just a bunch of strangers in a Discord. A strong community comes from the people sharing a bond as a result of wanting the same thing in life. This is not necessarily something to tackle pre-launch, as the community will grow with new sets of users once on mainnet, but something to be aware of.

Carl Jung wrote about archetypes in the 1950s where they extrapolated 12 different archetypes and a corresponding core desire for each one. It would be a good exercise at some point to consider what archetype Joystream’s community primarily consists of, which would allow the project to communicate more effectively with them.

## Branding

When speaking of branding, there’s often a misconception that it’s about the logo, website, tagline, and so on. As I studied branding more and more my conclusion is that what branding really boils down to is one simple idea: how do you make people feel? In many ways this ties back into community because the feeling you want people to associate with your brand is an extension of the thing they want. The logo, website etc is the visual communication of that feeling.

Hugo Boss is an example that is built on The ruler archetype (wants wealth and power). What’s the feeling someone who wants wealth and power to have..? Control. That’s what wealth and power gives you. So their entire brand is built on the emotion of control.

Example:

If you’re born into success, then it’s something outside of your control. If success is MADE, then anyone can have it. You have the power to control the outcome.

As Joystream gets more clarity around the core desire of the community, the subsequent question is what emotion do we want them to feel when they think of Joystream?

Again, this is an ongoing thing that is likely to be a more useful exercise down the road.

## Growth marketing campaigns

I’ve been studying a few very successful web3 launches such as OpenDAO / $SOS (130k+ twitter followers in 4 days, 300,000 wallets claimed tokens in 7 days), Stepn (reached $2.4bn market cap in a few months), Sushi swap (attracted $1.4bn liquidity in just 7 days), among others.

What they all did, slightly differently, was to **tap into existing audiences** primarily through launchpads and airdrops. 

With respect to Joystream, tapping into existing audiences both for launch, and for ongoing marketing is likely to have a high probability of success. In fact, I started this initiative while at JSG. A partnership was organized with Talisman wallet to kick things off, but I departed before it was executed.

From the standpoint of gaining awareness , it’s my opinion that both doing a launchpad sale, and an airdrop should be considered.

### **Launchpads**

The primary reason for doing a launchpad sale is that you get to tap into an existing audience, and of course raise money. Launchpads typically take a small cut of the sales (a very generous one in my opinion). I actually think once launchpads realize the value they provide we’re going to see a dramatic increase in fees. Truth be told, even if launchpads took 100% of the money, for many projects it’d still be a good deal, because they offer the attention of their community without upfront investment.

**Questions by Ismail**

Why we should launch $JOY token on launchpad? 

- To get access to an already existing audience that we can convert into project followers and video creators

How exactly and in what way will this impact the platform and the community?

- More eyeballs, more activity

Which launchpad is most suitable for launch and why?

- This requires research. You’d need to build up a list of all the launchpad platforms and look into previous launches they have done to see whether they were successful or not (this is just one signal of the strength of their audience), look at Twitter follower count & engagement, and so on.

What are technical aspects we should consider?

- Well if we do it before launching the $JOY token does not exist, so you’d probably have to sell some type of token that can be converted to $JOY once it’s been created..?
- If launchpad sale came after launch then they’d have to be able to sell the $JOY token, whatever technical limitations that comes with

What are possible mistake we can do and we should be careful about them?

- Picking a weak launchpad → do the research and make an educated decision
- Not getting the most out of the launchpad → ensure they’ll use their marketing firepower at their disposal (social media, discord, email, etc)

## **Airdrops**

Doing an airdrop ultimately also comes down to acquiring attention. $SOS airdrop comes to mind where they airdropped OpenSea users on Christmas eve in 2021, and gained 130k+ twitter followers in 4 days, and 300k+ wallets claimed their tokens within 7 days. 

There are lots of video projects in the web3 space that could be airdropped. There are some tech constraints here, but I’d imagine it’s possible to do something along the lines of creating an erc20 token for example, airdropping that to Livepeer crowd, and having a mechanism that allows them to convert their erc20 token into $JOY. 

If this were my project, I’d be airdropping every single video project, why stop at one?

**Questions by Ismail**

Why we should $JOY airdrop? 

- It’s been very successful in some cases with respect to getting awareness on a project - look into $SOS airdrop as an example

What are technical aspects we should consider?

- Depends on who you are airdropping, most other projects are not in the Polkadot ecosystem. I’m not sure here but surely it’s possible to airdrop an erc20 token to say Livepeer crowd, and allow them to convert that token to $JOY?

What are possible mistakes we can do and we should be careful about them?

- Allocating large amounts of tokens without getting the desired outcome of attention/awareness
