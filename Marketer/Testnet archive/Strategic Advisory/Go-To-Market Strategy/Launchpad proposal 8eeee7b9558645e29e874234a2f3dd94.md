# Launchpad proposal

As Joystream looks to get its name out there, one of the “shortcuts” to doing so effectively is to tap into already existing audiences. This is what launchpads can offer. It’s quite a good business model: people are always looking to get in early on projects, projects are looking to raise awareness and raise capital, and the launchpads are looking to generate revenue: all 3 incentives align. Also, there’s usually no upfront fee with partnering with a launchpad, instead they typically take a % of the sales they help generate (a modest one typically less than 10%).

The primary problem this solves for Joystream is to raise awareness of the project, as our target launchpad would have a fairly sizable audience. A launchpad sale would also generate a relatively small chunk of capital (typically $50k - $250k range), which could be used for further marketing, or other operations.

For this to be effective it comes down to choosing a “good” launchpad. A good launchpad has a large and dedicated audience, and promotes their launches thoroughly. 

**The process would entail:**

1) Agreeing on the idea

2) Clarity around the amount of money to raise

3) A shortlist of 5 - 10 launchpads to approach (Robert has put together a list [here](https://kingmaking.xyz/crypto-launchpads/)). 

Presumably the [Gate.io launchpad](https://www.gate.io/startup) could be an interesting one as the investment arm of Gate.io is an investor in Joystream - also they sell out every single time simply due to the volume of customers & followers (1.1m on Twitter).

4) Landing a partner

5) Organizing the launch in conjunction with the partner (promotional materials, and potentially an AMA).
