Joystream DAO has working groups, but they are quite different from working groups of centralized organizations. Let’s see what the differences are.

First of all, you need to know the 3 parts of working group system of Joystream DAO. They are: 

- the Council,
- Working Group Leads,
- Workers.

The Council allocates resources to working groups, Leads manage groups and set up salaries for workers depending on their performance, and Workers do the job.

This system, like every other system, has its own advantages and disadvantages. Let's talk about advantages first.

### Advantages of Joystream DAO employment

- **work flexible hours**
Although being a member of a working group assumes some minimum activity, you can decide yourself how much time you want to dedicate to your job, there are no compulsory hours per week, and the work load is flexible. You will get paid more if you work more and do a good job.
- **participate in multiple groups**
We are used to having only one position in a centralized organization. In Joystream DAO you can be a participant of different working groups at the same time. You can combine very different jobs, for example, marketer and distributor, or builders lead and content curator.
- **suggest ideas and improvements**
Every member of a working group is not just a subordinate, who does what the Lead says. He/she can and even should suggest his ideas and improvements. The more workers will understand and perform this approach, the closer Joystream DAO will be to a truly decentralized organization. Initiative is very much appreciated, it is a driving force of every DAO - a bottom-up, not top-down organization. Look at working group tasks and processes as of something you can influence on and improve. It makes participation in Joystream DAO working groups exciting, allowing you to choose what you want to do, unleash you potential and bring more value to the DAO!
- **easy process of joining/leaving a working group**
You will not have to write a CV with personal information or have a long interview with HR if you want to join a working group. The process is easy - you apply for an open position using your membership account, list your skills and why you want to join, and then after the Lead reviews candidates, you can get hired! Your age, gender, nationality, education etc. does not matter at all. What matters are your skills, motivation, and your free time.
If you want to leave a group, you can do it right away just by clicking a button. You don't have any obligations, you will not be slashed in any way, your reputation in Joystream DAO will not suffer. If you have a good working history in this group, you can return at any time if there is an opening, or try yourself in another group.
- **earn allocation of mainnet tokens**
While you work in a Joystream DAO working group, you earn tJoy, which is a testnet token and can be cashed out to Bitcoin Cash at any time; and also Joy, which is a mainnet token. You can see how much you or others earned in [this table](https://joystream.retool.com/embedded/public/9478bcc0-f6d6-4f74-bd0a-0637535e75b1).
Currently testnet workers earn a lot of Joy, which means that they'll get a good share of mainnet tokens. Joy is a governance token, so you earn not only money, but also power. Having Joy, you'll be able vote, make proposals, apply for the Council and much more.

### Disadvantages of Joystream DAO employment

Here are disadvantages of Joystream DAO in its current state.

- **the salary is high in mainnet tokens, but much lower in cash-out money**
Although the salary is paid every day, which is certainly a big plus of Joystream over centralized organizations, the earnings may be low right now, while we are in the testnet phase. The main part of your earnings is not available right away. You'll have to wait for mainnet to cash out a substantial sum of money. Also, to be able to do it, you'll need to achieve a Founding Member status, which currently takes on average several months of work to get.
Things will change substantially, when we'll get to mainnet. If you want to know more, watch [this video](https://play.joystream.org/video/26736), in which Bedeho Mender, the CEO of Joystream, talks about the salary that can be expected in mainnet.
- **no stability, salary may change every week**
Work planning and performing is tied to the duration of a Council term (currently a week). At the beginning of each term the Council decides on budget for groups, and at the end of the term the Lead of each WG reports on the work done by the group. The budgets of groups are not fixed, and your salary may change every week depending on how many tokens were allocated to the group by the Council this week and how the Lead distributed it among workers.
- **no paid leave, health insurance and pension contributions**
Working in Joystream DAO doesn't give you all these benefits, which you're probably used to if you worked in centralized organizations. In [this video](https://play.joystream.org/video/26731) Bedeho Mender gives a detailed answer on the problem of social security of workers in web3 space.

As you can see, working in Joystream DAO has its own advantages and disadvantages. You will likely want to participate if you appreciate flexibility and opportunity to influence the decisions and direction of organization you are working for, but you may find it unsutable for you if you need money "here and now" and want some financial stability and social benefits.
