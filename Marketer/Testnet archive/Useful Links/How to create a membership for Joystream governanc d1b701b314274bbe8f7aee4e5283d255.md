Joystream governance app is called Pioneer, it serves as an on-chain governance app and on-chain forum, you can take a look at it [here](https://dao.joystream.org/). Every action is recorded on blockchain, which makes governance transparent and allows to have the history of membership actions.

Via Pioneer you can create your membership in Joystream network, transfer you tJoy tokens, apply for working groups and Council, create proposals, vote for them if you are a consul, create Bounties and participate in them, vote for Council candidates on elections, write messages on forum. 

To start using Pioneer you need to have a Joystream membership created either on [Pioneer](https://dao.joystream.org/) itself or on [Atlas](https://play.joystream.org/), which is a video platform app. Creating a membership requires you first to create a Polkadot account using Polkadot.js app. Below are the detailed instructions how you can do it. Remember that even if you have already installed the extension and have some Polkadot accounts created for other networks, for privacy reasons it is recommended that you create a new Polkadot account for Joystream network. 

### 1. **Install Polkadot.js extension**

The Polkadot extension provides a mechanism to generate an account and interact with all Polkadot/Kusama projects including Joystream. If you don’t have this extension in your browser, the first step will be to install it. 
The browser extension is available for [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en) (plus Chromium-based browsers), so click the relevant link and install.

**Optional step: Update metadata** 
Make sure to update metadata on Polkadot/Kusama Portal. If you haven’t interacted with Polkadot Portal in this browser and have just installed the extension, most likely you will need to update metadata to see Joystream network among networks when you create an account using Polkadot.js extension.
So, if you click this [link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.joystream.org%3A9944#/settings) and see a blue circle near Metadata tab, click on Metadata tab, press Update metadata and then, in the pop-up window, allow the extension to do it.

You can close this page now. 

### 2. **Create an account in extension**

![polkadot_extension.png](How%20to%20create%20a%20membership%20for%20Joystream%20governanc/polkadot_extension.png)

You already have your Polkadot.js installed in your browser. Next, you need to create a new Polkadot account. 
Open Polkadot.js browser extension. Click the big plus button or select Create new account from the small plus icon in the top right. You should see the following menu, with generated mnemonic seed in the form of twelve words and the address.

The **seed** is your key to the account. Knowing the seed allows you (or anyone else who knows the seed) to get control on this account and even re-create it, if you forget the password. It's very important to store it somewhere securely, preferably on paper or other non-digital device, not in digital storage or on a computer.

Save the seed and press Next step. You should see the following menu.

**Network** - select the Joystream network from the drop-down list. If you could not find the Joystream network, then most likely you did not update the metadata, go back to step 1 and do it.

**Name** (in our case, SuperAccount) is just account's name for your use only. It is not stored on the blockchain and will not be visible to other users. 

**Password** is used to encrypt your account's information. You will need to re-enter it when signing transactions on the portal. Create one and remember it.

As a result, after creating an account, you will see it in the list of accounts in Polkadot.js extension. By clicking on three dots, you can rename the account, export it, remove it from the extension and change the network used for the account.

### 3. Create a Membership account in Pioneer

Open Pioneer by clicking [here](https://dao.joystream.org/). 

Click Join now button either on the upper right or on the bottom left corner of the page.

In this window, you should specify if you were referred by a member. The toggle-switch is set to No by default, you can switch to Yes and choose a member if you were referred by somebody. Remember, we have a referral program, which gives mainnet Joy tokens to both referrer and referral! 
Next, you'll need to write your **Member Name** (can be a real name or whatever you would like to be addressed, can also be the same as your Membership handle) and **Membership handle**, which is basically, a nickname (you can change it later if you want). 

*Membership handle along with your membership ID, which is automatically assigned to you while you create a membership, are the two main things used for identification. In my case they look like this:*

Now let’s return to our registration window. If you scroll down, you will see two more fields - **About member** and **Member Avatar**. They are not compulsory, but nice to have. You can choose any picture you want - your own photo or some picture from Internet as your member avatar. If you dedicate some time and effort to Joystream, you’ll become a Founding Member and will choose your own handcrafted avatar in the same style as my avatar above. You can read more about Founding Members Program and see more avatars [here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/founding-member-program). 

Agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and press Create a Membership. The transaction will be recorded in blockchain, which usually takes something like 15 seconds, after which you'll see this message:

Now you can start using Joystream governance app and forum, I hope you’ll enJoy!
