**Sent by MWG to jsgeneis**

(This proposal show great importance of launchpad and propose specific launchpad for mainnet launch, It is not mandatory to consider only one launchpad, if jsgenesis agree on launchpad idea then they can consider any launchpad using their team, MWG will facilitate through anyway, Robert has put together a list of launchpads [here](https://kingmaking.xyz/crypto-launchpads/))

As Joystream looks to get its name out there, one of the effective method is to tap in already existing audiences. This is what launchpads can offer on mainnet launch. It’s quite a good model: people are always looking to get in early on projects, projects are looking for brand awareness and sometimes funds too: both incentives align. Because all reputable launchpads have its own vetting processes for startups to list which make projects trustworthy for people.
