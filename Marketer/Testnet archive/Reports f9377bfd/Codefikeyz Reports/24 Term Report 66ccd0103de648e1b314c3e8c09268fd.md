# 24 Term Report

- A summary of the recruiting process for the period

Content curators/Copywriters which I am currently recruiting to fill the available position seem to be a little difficult to convince to work for a DAO and get paid in community token which is currently not trading for other assets, most demand to be paid via wire transfer upfront before embarking on the Joystream project. While for some do not get to really understand the program nor the part where they really come in as a content curator/Copywriter, this is much more easier for Developers who see the vision, get assigned a task where they can apply their knowledge. This slows recruiting down a little, as few tend to ignore Dms for days only to assert that they wouldn't be able to work for community tokens.

In general, a few of the individual who seem to watch the "What is Joystream" Video to an extent get to love the idea and wants to be a part of the community.

- Perform a status update for all users recruited, by an entry in the `CRM`
 in previous periods: **What are the biggest success stories, and what can we learn from that?**

Most users who were able to sign up membership were able to do this in the heat of the moment as a warm welcome was offered by the community and assistance towards creating membership. But a few lost interest after trying to either verify or create Membership and ended up with an error page without getting any solution. Those who got assistance were able to complete this process and are yet to pick a bounty.

In General, follow up is Key, a lot of individuals might have lost the fire passion that ignited them to join the community when you don't check up on them for a while.
So I suggest we have a workspace here on notion where we drop users information whom we are currently following up, with updates on:
• If they are yet to join discord
• Yet to verify
• Yet to create Membership
• Indicate if any issue is being faced at any point of the whole process
• Assigned initial tokens
• What skill or particular position does this individual have or is hoping to fill in the Joystream community
• What the individual's general response looks like towards being a part of a DAO, working and being paid with community token.
• Yet to be assigned bounty
• Yet to complete bounty and submit bounty
• Yet to apply for a WG position
• If they have been accepted or rejected.
If we could jointly track and update the status of these potential members daily, it would help us to keep in touch with potential recruits and to stay efficient with Joystream recruitment and integration process. Being checked up on by multiple workers from a community you are yet to be a part of creates a good feeling of belonging and being wanted and can motivate the user to become part of the DAO faster than expected.
