# 25 Term Report

- **A summary of the recruiting process for the period**

Reaching out to Freelance developers communities on Discord. Most developers do not feel okay with the idea of working for a token yet to be launched and cashing out 8% of earnings at mainnet launch. This can be observed by their unwaivering demand to be paid in fiat or crypto that they can withdraw instantly before joining and working for the DAO. Some who joined the Discord server for some reason get to think that creating Membership on Joystream is something they didn't sign up for. Further follow up on the need for this and it's process is being carried out at the moment.

🎉 

Sometimes it's not really about how we market Joystream but the ability for people to see the Vision of what we are building and how we are trying to make everyone be a part of it. It really gives me Joy when I meet people who got a longterm vision just as I do and bring them on to Joystream, this might be one in a hundred, but it gladdens my heart to meet folks who are passionate about building something iconic as Joystream, this for me is my Success story.
