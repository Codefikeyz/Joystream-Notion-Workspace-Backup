# 25 Term Report

- **A summary of the recruiting process for the period**

🎉 my recruiting process starts with putting out notices in discord servers for a particular recruiting position, after that interested candidates reaches out via DM and i go ahead to introduce them to joystream DAO and what the gig entails, after that i check out their resume and if they seem qualified i try to convince them on what a rare and rewarding opportunity it is to be part of such project, if they agree to participate then i go ahead to bring them into the joystream discord channel, help them with membership registration, then with bounty and when they get to working group application, i go ahead to talk to the group leads they applied you about them.
