**AREAS COVERED DURING RESEARCH**

- **Social media management**

social media is the pinnacle of information in this age, people get more news from facebook and twitter than television and more so in the crypto and web3 spaces, while researching on other projects, it is clear that projects with more presence on social media has more engagements, verasity as a case study, you could see that they publish any of their milestones on the social media pages, as at the time of this research, their [twitter](https://twitter.com/verasitytech) followers are over 270k, with that number of followers, its not surprising each of their posts has at least 30k engagements, this includes retweets that would be seen by non-followers, joystream need to make a serious move towards social media engagements. 

- **Partnerships**

It’s fundamental to make strategic partnerships with potential users, forums, online spaces, podcasts and channels with access to a lot of viewers/listeners, at the course of this research, looking into a more established platform like theta, I noticed the tremendous amount of partnerships they have been making to reach more audience.  Making attractive offers to platforms to lure them to your project especially at the earliest stage should be a priority. A single partnership can expose a project to an entire target group that it didn’t have access to before, going through so similar platform I find that their partnership announcement posts attract a lot of engagements and users increase tremendously after such announcements. such announcements can be found on their [twitter](https://twitter.com/Theta_Network) page

- **Public relations**

Interviews and ama sessions plays an astonishing role to the marketing of web3 and crypto related projects, from my research, blockchain is vast and complicated, being so means very few people understand it and even at that, it takes years to grasp which means for a newbie to get into any of such project they’ll have to be taught, this is where interviews and ama sessions come in, the similar projects that are growing rapidly have that in common, educating the general public on the details of their project on different spaces increases their users and even introduces the projects to new target groups. 

- **Team exposure**

Most of the thriving projects, I noticed that the core team members are available to the public, there’s a certain level of trust associated with a project where the public can relate to the team behind it, projects like [chainflix](https://www.chainflix.biz/), [theta](https://www.thetatoken.org/about), [lbry](https://lbry.com/team) all have their core team members right on their website with links to their socials

## recommendations for joystream

**social media engagement**

- As of the moment of this research, their are over 2800 members on joystream discord server, and an average of 300 members online at every given moment, now i this that the MWG should implement that everyone i the discord community should go follow and subscribe to all joystream channels and should be retweeting, commenting and sharing any posts made by the pages. MWG should make a competition out of this for motivation with very attractive rewards.
- MWG should employ writers and graphic designers or at least select from the pool of talents we have to compose write ups on several updates and features of joystream with visual effects to be posting on these pages, this should be a continuous thing and not a one-off thing.
- the MWG should have some sort of access to the socials, it makes no sense that jsgenesis is in-charge of the twitter page alone, the bureaucracy of asking permission and waiting for a post to be delivers is a bit daunting, the MWG lead could be doing the verification himself, that would fasten the process.
- there should be at least 1 or 2 post on joystream socials daily, checking up on twitter as of the time of writing this, there hasn’t been a single post for over a month, seems like we are focusing on the technical development of joystream and forgetting that the non-technical part is just as important, to attract users we have to build a community. that doesn’t show seriousness especially in a project that just went live, also our telegram channel seems to be dormant, we should have working group members who’s sole task is moderating the telegram chat, at this point the people with access has their hands full with the technical development of joystream so the job should be handed over to community managers

## partnerships

- Joystream direct users are gateway providers that would build their platforms on the joystream network, identifying those gateway providers and making partnerships that would be beneficial to both parties will separate joystream from other similar networks, through the apps working group we can provide technical support and they can capitalize on our other working groups in developing their platforms Identifying this platforms.
- while we are recruiting gateway providers, At this early stage, the MWG should utilize gleev and target video content creators while we await the launch of atlas, for now content creators on [gleev](https://www.notion.so/Gleev-Operation-2ee6319c7688464c8800ecbfa3b17abd?pvs=21) would bring the entire DAO the much needed exposure, MWG should research some content creators to reach out to for them to put up a channel for their content on gleev and atlas alike.

## public relations

- Joystream should organize weekly external AMAs and interviews is spaces like telegram, twitter reddit, medium e.t.c, this can be done by jsgenesis or council members with vast knowledge of joystream ecosystem. Making a list of species that conduct interviews and AMAs and reaching out to them to be on their spaces should be included to the priority list of the MWG, being a long term crypto enthusiast, I particularly know how much of my investment has revolved around attending AMAs of the projects which boosted my confidence in them so I think joystream should do so too.

## team exposure

- At this point founding members should indicate that that they’re associated with joystream on the their social media pages, if you went to twitter right now, you won’t be able to make out up to 5 working group members or even council members of joystream from their twitter bio, i think we should implement that.

## conclusion

while we still have a long way to go to be where we want to be, tackling the above issues which seems like they are little at the moment would go along way into pushing us ahead especially now that we need or the attention we can get to help us i priorities like token listing, i was talking to a potential recruit about joining joystream builders working group and when i told him of the potential, he question was “if joystream has such potentials how come i spend 12 hours daily online and i’ve never heard of it?”. such a question shouldn’t be associated with joystream and the above recommendations can fix it
