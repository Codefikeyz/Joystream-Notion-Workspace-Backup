Self-evolving media platform DAO with powerful governance app (pioneer app.xyz).
Built on and operated by the Joystream blockchain and DAO.
Joystream is an open source platform, with an open blockchain at its core, powering multiple video streaming Apps at once.
Decentralized content storage and content distribution operated by DAO.
Storage system Joystream uses a distributed file storage system to store and manage the video content on the platform. This system, Colossus, is built on top of a decentralized storage network such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or Filecoin.
The Colossus will use a combination of decentralized storage nodes and traditional cloud storage providers to store and serve the video content on the platform. This will allow the platform to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of traditional cloud storage providers while also leveraging the security and decentralization of a distributed file storage system.
**Tokenomics**
Joystream, our decentralized video platform is a blockchain-based platform that allows for the creation and distribution of tokens that represent ownership and voting rights within the platform. These tokens, $JOY, are used to govern various aspects of the platform, including policy decisions, content moderation, and revenue distribution.
Joystream users will be able to earn $JOY by contributing valuable content, participating in the platform's governance process, and completing other tasks as determined by the community. Content creators will also be able to earn $JOY through their contributions, as well as through direct payments from users who wish to support their work.
JOY will be distributed using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which allows users to earn tokens by "staking" their $JOY as collateral for the validation of transactions on the platform. This process will require users to have a certain minimum balance of $JOY in order to participate, and will be used to ensure the security and stability of the platform.

In addition to their use as a governance and revenue-sharing token, $JOY will also be used as a means of exchange within the platform, allowing users to purchase goods and services from other users and content creators.

**Conclusion**
Joystream has the potential to offer a new and better way for users and content creators to connect, create, and share video content.
By leveraging blockchain technology and a decentralized governance model, we can create a platform that is transparent, fair, and community-driven,
and that supports the growth and success of independent creators. The use of $JOY and the Colossus storage system will be key components of this platform,
allowing you to create a truly decentralized and user-driven video platform.
