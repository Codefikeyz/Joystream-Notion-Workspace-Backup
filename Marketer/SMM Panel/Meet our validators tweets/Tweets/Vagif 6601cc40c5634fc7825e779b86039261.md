A little about the validator:
An individual Professional Validator with extensive experience with Linux and Docker.
I approach my business responsibly. 
I am the Senior Ambassador of the Moonbeam project.
I keep track of announcements and updates in a timely manner. 
I observe the security system during validation. 
An important component is the availability of high-quality technical equipment.
Participated in the Joystream project from the very beginning.
At the moment I'm choosing a workgroup in Joystream.
Validators who are related as early project participants will value their position more, but it is certainly necessary to choose responsible and loyal validators. I always help the network members, we are all like one family!
I will be glad to support the project!
