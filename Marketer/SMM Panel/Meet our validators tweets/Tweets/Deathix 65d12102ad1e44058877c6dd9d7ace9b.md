A little about the validator:

I've been working in IT for more than 15 years. At the current moment, I work as a senior DevOps engineer and starting my career as Python Developer. Since the last year, I've become a crypto enthusiast and started participating in many different projects and testnets. JoyStream is the project I dedicate most of my time to and I already have experience as a validator and part/Lead of a distributors work group
