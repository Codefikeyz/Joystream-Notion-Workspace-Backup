Dear [Content Creator],

Writing to you on behalf of Joystream DAO, a decentralized solution for making video platforms. We noticed that you are passionate about creating valuable content and pushing web3 on Youtube! As a community of web3 enthusiasts, we know how important it is to be able to reach the masses, and Youtube is a great way to do so. 

However, we think it is also the time to promote decentralized solutions for sharing videos and to offer additional features like NFTs and creator tokens, so that the content creators can have benefits of both web2 and web3 space.

Our video platform Gleev is built on blockchain and is aimed specifically at web3 and crypto content creators and consumers. Now we’re launching Youtube Partner Program [link], and you are eligible to be among the pioneers of Gleev. It pays to be first, as we offer great benefits and a good share of $Joy tokens to our first crypto channels!

Joy tokens are Joystream's native currency, which is used to participate in the governance, buy NFTs, trade on exchanges, or simply be held as a long-term investment. You can also mint your own tokens, turn your videos into NFTs and sell them on our marketplace.

By participating in Joystream’s Youtube Partner Program, you can easily juggle platforms and reap the benefits of both. You don’t even need to manually upload videos, as we’ve built a dedicated backend application, integrated with Youtube and Gleev to facilitate the content upload. It’s only a matter of a few clicks! Not only will you continue to reach your existing audience on Youtube, but you'll also gain access to Joystream's growing community of web3 and crypto enthusiasts.

So why wait? Sign up for Joystream's Youtube Partner Program today and start earning Joy tokens for your content. It's the perfect opportunity to grow your income and audience.

Thank you for considering Joystream as your next platform for web3 and crypto video content. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
