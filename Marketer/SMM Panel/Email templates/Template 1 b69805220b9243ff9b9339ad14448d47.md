Dear [Content Creator],

We are reaching out to tell you that we've conducted research on web3 Youtube channels and found your channel eligible for our Youtube Partner Program, aimed to bring this type of content to a web3 space. 

We've built a video platform specifically for content about crypto and web3. It is decentralized, built on blockchain, and offers unique features. We believe that content creators should have full ownership and control over their content and be rewarded fairly for their efforts. That's why our platform Gleev is free from censorship and allows creators to monetize their content using cryptocurrency. Now we are looking for content creators to fill it with their high-quality videos, and you are definitely one of them!

Being eligible for the program means that you can simply upload your existing content from Youtube to our video platform Gleev, and get $Joy tokens. You don't need to choose between Youtube and Gleev, get the benefits of both!

You can easily migrate your existing Youtube content to our platform with just a few clicks, using the auto-sync service. After that, you will have access to a variety of features that are not available on Youtube, including NFTs and creator tokens, which means that you can mint your own tokens and sell NFTs.

At Joystream DAO, we have a great community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about decentralized technology and content creation. We believe that our community is what sets us apart from other platforms, and we would love for you to be a part of it.

More information about the program, including reward tiers and conditions, can be found here [[https://joystream.notion.site/YPP-programme-d492c2eb88ff4ace955b5f2902ec21fb](https://www.notion.so/YouTube-Partner-Program-Outline-d492c2eb88ff4ace955b5f2902ec21fb?pvs=21)].

Thank you for taking the time to read this email. We hope to see you on Gleev soon and look forward to welcoming you to the Joystream DAO community.

Best regards,

[your name]
