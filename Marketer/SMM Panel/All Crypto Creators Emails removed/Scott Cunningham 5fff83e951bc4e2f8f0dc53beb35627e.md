Description: I am the host of Crypto & Things and a huge social blockchain enthusiast using what I believe to be the next level of social communication. I make educational content, review platforms, share my passive & crypto income journey, and most importantly, I get the opportunity to interview and chat with so many amazing people in the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and tech space.

Blockchain social media is the next frontier for digital marketing and presents an opportunity we can capitalize on. I have reviewed over 223 platforms and I want to continue teaching people about blockchain technology as well as sharing my financial journey towards retirement.
