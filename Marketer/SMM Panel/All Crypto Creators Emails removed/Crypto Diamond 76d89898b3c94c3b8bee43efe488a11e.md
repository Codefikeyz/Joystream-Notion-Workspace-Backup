Description: Hello, my name is Crypto Diamond. My goals with this channel are to teach the everyday person what projects are out there, How to find them, what resources to look into before investing, and how to buy assets off traditional exchanges, and in the long run, have fun and make money! I have been in the Crypto field for over 3 years. I now work full-time Crypto. I have had positions such as project ambassador, community manager, marketing, and founder. I make the mistakes for you so you can invest smoothly. It's a maze out there so let me help you through it.
