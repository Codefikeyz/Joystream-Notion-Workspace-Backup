Description: Weekly information about Bitcoins Lightning Network from a developer. I am an independent data science freelancer. I studied Mathmatics, Physics and Chinese and gathered 20 years experience in programming and software engineering.

I try to upload a new video every Monday.

As a former front runner for the pirate party during the 2017 federal election I am an  activist for open source, open educational resources and open access. Therefor the videos I create will be - if possible - openly licensed. 

Consider leaving a tip if you apriciate my work: 1CWtSk58d3rN1R3oGwMobJ6Ets9E2gvPj5 you can also do this with more privacy with my lightning network node: http://ln.rene-pickhardt.de
