Description: IamSatoshi — In Decentralization We trust

Through a strict investigation process of the decentralized experiment Bitcoin as an innovative open source protocol to global finance, this practice-based research effectively shares the role of money being the medium, and how society perceives it. Through this journey, we get to learn about the origin and ethics of Bitcoin's developers, and explore their wide spectrum of professions, beliefs and social representation. We will try to uncover how they see Bitcoin, the message.

Framed by an investigative approach to expose Bitcoin as a global digital currency, as well as ground breaking technology, this documentary research explores different ways in which the peer-to-peer network can help challenge certain issues societies face globally, and at times propose a cheaper, more efficient and effective alternative.
