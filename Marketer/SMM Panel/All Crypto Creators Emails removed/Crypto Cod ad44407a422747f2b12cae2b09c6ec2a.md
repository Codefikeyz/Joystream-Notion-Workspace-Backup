Description: Hi, thanks for coming to view my channel.

I'm a cryptocurrency investor and have been since 2013. Living in the UK.

The purpose of this channel is to take people through what i have learned so far (sometimes the hard way), Cryptocurrency news, Trends and Potential Moonshots for low market cap coins. 

Also will be hosting giveaways and airdrops! 

If you don't want to miss out on Airdrops, make sure to follow my twitter at https://twitter.com/CryptoCodYtube
