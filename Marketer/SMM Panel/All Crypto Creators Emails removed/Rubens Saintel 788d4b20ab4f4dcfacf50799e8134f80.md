Description: I am at heart an Entrepreneur. 

I hope to make this the preeminent source for videos related to Personal Wealth, Technology, Movies and of course Music. I will first and foremost be talking about ways to help you stop living paycheck to paycheck. I’ll also discuss product releases, review gadgets, and have conversations about new music for you to vibe. What sets me apart is a dedication to connect. NOTE: My words, views, and videos are all my own.

You can find me on many platforms as: @Saintel 
Both Barack Obama the former President of USA and Michel Martelly the Former President of Haiti follow me on Twitter 
