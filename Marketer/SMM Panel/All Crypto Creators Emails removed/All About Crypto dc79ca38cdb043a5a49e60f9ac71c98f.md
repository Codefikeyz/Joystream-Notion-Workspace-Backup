Description: Hello there, I appreciate you taking the time to visit my channel All About Crypto. Here you will find a plethora of crypto knowledge, updates, and fundamental and technical analysis. Subscribe to my channel and don't forget to hit the bell button for notifications.
I'm Deepak Yadav, a hard-core crypto enthusiast. I have worked as an Asst. Professor for three years in the past, and later pursued a full-time Ph.D. from IIT Delhi. However, I dropped the course later and started working for a renowned Edtech Company. My goal is to provide you with guidance and tips for succeeding in the cryptocurrency market. Earning money in the cryptocurrency market, in my opinion, is not difficult if you have a thorough understanding of cryptocurrencies and technical charts.
