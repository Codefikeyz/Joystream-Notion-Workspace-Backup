Description: Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform that makes it easy to build applications on Polkadot. ​

 Use the Ethereum tools you know and love (like Truffle, Remix, and MetaMask) to run Solidity smart contracts on the Polkadot network. 
 Take advantage of native Polkadot integration capabilities to move tokens on and off the platform, and provide services to other chains.
 Connect existing Ethereum-based front-ends to Moonbeam!
