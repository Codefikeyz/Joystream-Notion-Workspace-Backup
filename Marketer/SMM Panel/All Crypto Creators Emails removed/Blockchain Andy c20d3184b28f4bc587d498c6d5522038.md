Description: Hey guys Blockchain Andy here!

Welcome to my YouTube channel, I have been in the crypto space since 2017 and have been growing my knowledge ever since. I AIM to provide knowledgeable content and trading opportunities to my subscribers along with informative interviews with key social influencers and crypto projects.

I aim to upload at least 4/5 times a week, with news and updates regarding cryptocurrency projects focusing on Zilliqa the project I hold the most of and believe in.

I hope you enjoy me on this journey and look forward to speaking to you!

This is my personal opinion and not financial advice.
