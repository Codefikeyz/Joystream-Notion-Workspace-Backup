Description: Follow Altcoin Radar for simple and honest crypto videos on a regular basis!

Altcoin Radar is a place where you can learn about crypto projects, crypto trading, the metaverse, and hear my opinions on various cryptocurrencies!

If you like my channel, please subscribe and share with others.

In addition, my videos are NOT offers to buy or sell securities. My videos are not 'buy' or 'sell' signals of any kind. ALL videos are for informational and entertainment purposes only. Investing and trading in cryptocurrencies is VERY RISKY, as anything can happen at any time.

It is also important to note that I am NOT a financial advisor and my videos are based strictly on my own opinions. Any and all investments you make are your responsibility. 

Make your own decisions and do you own research.
