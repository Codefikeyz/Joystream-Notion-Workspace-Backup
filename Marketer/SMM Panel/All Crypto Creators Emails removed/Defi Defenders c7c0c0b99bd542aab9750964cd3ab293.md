Description: Defi Defenders are the protectors of the Decentralized Crypto Space! We scour the rabbit holes in search of 10x 100x 1000x projects when they are in the early stages. Me and my team have created multiple 6 figure crypto investors and we are looking to impact even more! We will be hosting AMA's, Reviewing Projects, Live Fair Launches, Presales & Whitelists, Major Crypto News Updates, & Even Crypto Gaming Streams!

We are not financial advisors we are just purely researching and speculating a new asset class, always do your own research. We try our best to minimize the risks of investing in this crazy crypto space, but as with any investing there are significant risks you can lose your investment due to extreme volatility and unforeseen circumstances.
