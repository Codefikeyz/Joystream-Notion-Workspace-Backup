Description: Hey guys, welcome to Crypto Ahoy. On this channel I will be doing crypto reviews, updates, tutorials, finance, as well as bring awareness of men's rights, and more. I'm just the messenger. I don't make the rules, I just report them. I'm not a religious person but I do believe the bible is true. 

My goal in this channel is to bring people together from all walks of life. I will simply provide you with all the information I find such as the good & the bad, pros & cons, and data. Basically, I'll present both sides of the coin—pun intended—and you decide what to do with it, because at the end of the day, the choice is yours.

Check out my videos and hope you find them helpful and informative!
