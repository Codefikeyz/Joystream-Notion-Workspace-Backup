Description: Our mission is to empower everyone to own their crypto future. SafePal is a fast-growing team of developers, designers and security engineers striving to eliminate the hurdles for crypto beginners. We help people unlock their crypto potential and grow their wealth with confidence and ease.  Security is built into our products, but safety depends on what we do. From identifying potential cyberattacks to refining our systems, we work every day to protect our users and their assets.

In 2018, Veronica Wong, a veteran in the tech industry, founded SafePal with two co-founders who shared her mission. Initially a hardware wallet, SafePal has since evolved to a complete suite of smart, secure crypto management solutions accessible for tech pros and non-geeks alike.

In only a handful of years, we've garnered the support of industry giants like Binance and risen from a humble (but ambitious) startup to a global enterprise and we're just getting started.
