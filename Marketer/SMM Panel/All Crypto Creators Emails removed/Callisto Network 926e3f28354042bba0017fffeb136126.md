Description: Blockchain as seen by Security Experts.

Since its launch by the developers of Ethereum Commonwealth (Ethereum Classic), Callisto Network focused its attention on the weakness of the cryptocurrency space, namely the security.

Since 2018, we have made numerous contributions to improve $ETH, $ETC, $EOS and audited over 350 smart contracts, making us the crypto-security industry leader. 

With this experience, we have established Callisto Enterprise, a branch company focusing on enterprise applications of blockchain technology. Several major public transport companies from central and eastern Europe have joined us in this initiative.
