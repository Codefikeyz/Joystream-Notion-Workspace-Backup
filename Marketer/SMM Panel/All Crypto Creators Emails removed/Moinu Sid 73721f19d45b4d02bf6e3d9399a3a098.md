Description: With the combination of Engineering, Accounting, and Management qualifications my aim is to find the best efficiency in businesses whereby reducing overhead costs and automation processes.  I was very inspired by the decentralization methodology of crypto.  I felt that businesses that incorporated the crypto blockchain would be bulletproof without any human intervention.  The reason is, the blockchain cannot be manipulated. Since then I was on the lookout for Businesses using Crypto when they are just forming and listing tokens/coins.  As an example a token/Coin bought for $10 with four zeros after the dot say 0.0001 can give you 1,000,000 coins/token; then when the zeroes reduce say to 0.01 the token/coin would be only 1000 tokens received. Therefore my hunt has been to identify a business at the very beginning and invest in SMALL DOLLARS. I am just going to share my journey BUT THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL advice. YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE YOU INVEST.
