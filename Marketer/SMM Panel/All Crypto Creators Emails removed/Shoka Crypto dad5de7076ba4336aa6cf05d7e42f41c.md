Description: Hello Guys, My name is Ebele, friends call me Shoka. I started my youtube channel during the Corona Virus pandemic. We all have things we have learnt during this period. So, I have decided to use this period and opportunity to reach out to the world on some DIY tutorials that can save you some money, that is fun engaging in, you can also use these to enjoy your weekends and vacations orrrrr if you are someone like me that always have hands doing something, then what are you waiting for, this channel is for all of us.
I will be uploading videos on a weekly basis on cooking, tote bags, room DIYs, table DIYs.
