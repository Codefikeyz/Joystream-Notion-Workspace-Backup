Description: Bitcoin Events is the proud organiser of the blockchain conferences – the first of its kind in Africa, as well as the largest focusing on blockchain technology.

Bitcoin Events was founded in 2014 by Sonya Kuhnel and Theo Sauls who saw a need to educate and inform people about the opportunities that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in Africa offer.

Bitcoin Events has hosted six Blockchain Africa Conferences in Cape Town and Johannesburg and its inaugural Crypto Fest in 2019.
