Description: Hello, I am Blame Truth. I started this channel back in 2007 as a hobby. I'd post Gears of War recorded off a Dazzle standard definition PVR... which was recorded off a VHS tape. No shit. Times have changed.

Today I'm able to do this as a full time job due to ad revenue and Twitch streaming. I get to game for a living and it's pretty cool. Thanks for the continued support!
