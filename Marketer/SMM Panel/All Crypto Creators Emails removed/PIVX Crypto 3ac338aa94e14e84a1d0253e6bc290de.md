Description: PIVX (Cryptocurrency): Private Instant  VerifiedTransaction

PIVX is a cutting edge technology, however, with that, it’s also much more that just bits of code and elaborate algorithms.  It’s a community.  It’s an organically growing network of individuals assembling a set of core principals, beliefs, visions, and ideas, collaborating together to develop PIVX.  We are, at the end of the day, a collective of human beings coming together, inputting our various energies, resources, talents, and visions.  Some of us are phenomenal coders.  Others are expert project managers.  Some are new to crypto, while others have been at crypto since the dawning of bitcoin (including the individual involved in the historical “bitcoin pizza” transaction).  That said, there are a few folks who were at the core of the project, and from that, the community rapidly grew.  As a reminder, often in tech and crypto realms, individuals are known by their “handles” (think nicknames) more than their own names.
