Description: The official YouTube account for Coin Market Manager - the Bitcoin & Altcoin crypto portfolio tracking platform 

Track - Analyse - Improve.

We built Coin Market Manager to assist in our trading quest to increase our BTC stacks! 

We believed that the current crypto portfolio trackers on the market were not delivering the data that the community required, so we went about creating an all-in-one portfolio & crypto market tracking solution.

Coin Market Manager endeavours to focus value around in-depth BTC value growth tracking, all instantly available with the simple upload of a Read Only API Key.

Most importantly, a system that clearly displays the BTC value of trades and overall trade position, as accurately as possible.
