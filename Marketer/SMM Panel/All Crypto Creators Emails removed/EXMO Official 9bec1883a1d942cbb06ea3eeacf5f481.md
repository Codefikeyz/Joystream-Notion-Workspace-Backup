Description: EXMO is a European cryptocurrency exchange. The platform was established in 2013 and is constantly expanding its functionality, adding new assets to the listing, and, most importantly, increasing the number of customers. Now with more than 1.8 million users registered on EXMO, the average monthly trading volume exceeds $1.5 billion.

More than seven years of operation, flexible commissions, and fast technical support – these are among a list of reasons why clients choose EXMO. The exchange team stood at the origins of the crypto business, and during this time, we understood how to make trading convenient. We pride ourselves on EXMO's simple, intuitive interface, allowing users to begin their journey in crypto-trading easily.

The EXMO listing consists of 182 trading pairs, including 7 fiat currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, UAH, PLN, and KZT. Also, at the end of 2019, we released the EXMO exchange token EXMO Coin (EXM).
