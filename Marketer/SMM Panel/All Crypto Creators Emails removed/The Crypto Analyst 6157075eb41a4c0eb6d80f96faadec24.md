Description: This channel is all about investing and earning money off crypto currencies. I talk about what I invest in, what I believe is going to become popular (and why), crypto news, and ways for normal everyday people to make money easily from crypto trading. (I am not in anyway a professional adviser or investor. I am just someone who seeks to help people achieve there dreams and make more money so that they can have a more enjoyable life. Everything I say is my opinion and all investments should be discussed with a professional adviser before buying in. I am not responsible for any loss of money because my advise is just what I am investing in and not guaranteed to make you money. Invest at your own risk!)
