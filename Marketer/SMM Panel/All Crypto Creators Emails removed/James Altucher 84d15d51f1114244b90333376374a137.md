Description: I’m an entrepreneur and angel investor. I’ve achieved the rank of chess master. And I’m the author of the Wall Street Journal bestselling book “Choose Yourself.”

I’ve started 20 companies, 17 of which have failed. But I’ve learned a lot along the way.

If you’ve ever been stuck—in a job you hate, in a house you can’t afford, in a life you don’t want, in your own depressed mind, anything—I want to help you.

Why? Because I get it. I’ve been there. And I want to tell you how I freed myself so maybe you can start to free yourself, too.

Before I get into anything else, I’ve recorded this video I want you to watch…

A lot has happened since I first started. 

I now get to do what I love every day. I get to write books that mean something to me, and I get to interview really incredible people on my top-10 rated podcast, “The James Altucher Show.” 

I hope you'll subscribe.
