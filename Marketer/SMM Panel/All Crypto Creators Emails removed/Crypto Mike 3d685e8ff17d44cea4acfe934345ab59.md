Description: I used to be a YouTuber that did crypto reviews. I was pretty good at it too. 

But then I realized that everyone in the defi space is after the exact same thing; passive income. You know, 1% per day on your money right? 

So I decided to switch things up. I'm now a YouTuber that talks about trading. 

And I have to say, I'm loving it. It's a lot more challenging and as some of you may know already, I founded project GoldBridge, where I get a first row view of a master trader who literally hasn't had a red day THIS YEAR! (2022).. So yeah, I got a little inspired to say the least.

If you want to learn how I'm making 1% daily WITHOUT the need to rely on a crypto protocol that promises not to rug pull, then subscribe and jump along for the ride :)
