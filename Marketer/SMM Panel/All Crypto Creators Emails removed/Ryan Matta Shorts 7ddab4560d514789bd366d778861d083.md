Description: Welcome to The Crypto Network Live Stream. Your one-stop shop for cryptocurrency news coverage. My main focus will be covering the evolution of the Kadena Ecosystem. I believe that Kadena will replace 90% of crypto projects in this space. I have consolidated 50% of my portfolio into Kadena, 25% into Bitcoin 7.5% into Flux, and 7.5% into Luna. The remaining 10% I have in stablecoins and 100x degenerate moonshots that I’m too embarrassed to admit I have them in my portfolio! #kadena #bitcoin #luna
