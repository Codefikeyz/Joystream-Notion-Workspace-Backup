Description: Producer Big Tali was born Vitaliano Gallo in Catanzaro, the capital city of Italy’s Calabria region. He quickly developed a deep infatuation with all-things music, most notably a passion for the culture of hip-hop. Sooner than later Big Tali immersed himself in the world of music production, spending countless hours studying his craft, working for days on end until he achieved a mastery of the styles used by his favorite producer and major influence, DJ Premier. In the coming years he would begin to fully-realize his devotion to music and his burning desire to achieve in the world of music only grew from there.
