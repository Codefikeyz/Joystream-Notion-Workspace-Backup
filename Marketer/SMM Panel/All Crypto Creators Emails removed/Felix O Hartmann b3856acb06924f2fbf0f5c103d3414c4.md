Description: Felix Hartmann is a German-American Tech Entrepreneur, Futurist, and Asset Manager. Hartmann serves as the managing partner of Hartmann Capital, a frontier tech investment firm, home to both one of the first crypto asset hedge funds and metaverse venture funds. 

Next to the fund, Hartmann sits on the DAO of Enzyme finance and 88MPH, founded Crypto Academy, and published the bestselling dystopian fiction novel 'Dark Age'. 

Hartmann‘s mission is to guide the world away from a self-inflicted dystopia and towards a thriving future. 

Like the fire that Prometheus once brought to humans, the metaphorical earliest technology of the gods, Hartmann believes that technology can be used for good and evil and it’s our job to invest in the good and fight to prevent the bad.
