Description: Welcome to my channel. 

As a whole I will be creating content around the cryptocurrency market. The hardest part of your journey will be the beginning. Figuring out the processes, jargon, technical analysis and ultimately how to make informed investing decisions yourself. I will be creating a multi-part series on how to get going in crypto. It's finally time to change your life. 

Moreover, I will be eventually doing deep-dives into coins that I am interested in and ones that I think you should have a good look over yourself. I want to help you and the future channel community, reach a level of understanding on this subject, so that we can engage in open conversation regarding pros and cons of said coins.  Please subscribe, and let me know what I can do to assist you moving forward. I will happily address this in a comment or an entire video. Please also follow my socials for more up-to-date information.
