Description:  Hey there! I'm Alex and I make reviews and comparisons so Canadians can find the best crypto products in the country.

When I started my crypto journey in 2017, I was overwhelmed by the number of crypto exchanges, wallets, apps and amount information out there. There were so many things I wish I knew sooner.

On this channel you'll find straight to the point reviews, tutorials and things I wish I learned sooner so you can make better decisions when it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
