Description: I have been extremely successful trading, mining, and investing in cryptocurrencies and love to help others reach their dreams as well. I update new videos a few times a week to explain what's going on in the world of crypto. My aim is trying to help as many people as possible achieve their dreams. As a high school science teacher for over 27 years, I have dedicated my life to helping others. I hope I can help you as well. Please feel free to leave any questions or ideas for videos in the comment section below and subscribe!
