Description: Cryptocurrency and blockchain are going to immensely disruptive over the next decade.  As a new emerging market and asset class, it can be complex and difficult to navigate.  If you are new to crypto and interested in investing in the industry, looking to learn more, or meet new like-minded people in our community; you come to the right place.

We are crypto-enthusiasts since early 2017 and have been HODLing ever since.  I started my crypto journey in early 2017 as a blogger and part-time crypto consultant.  After the 2018 crypto winter, I closed our mining operation after losing nearly our entire initial investment.  Despite the circumstance, my belief in blockchain has never waivered.

In this channel, you will find crypto discussion, altcoin reviews, and occasional live Q&A crypto streams.  My goal is to give you my 2 cents, to help you make sense of crypto.
