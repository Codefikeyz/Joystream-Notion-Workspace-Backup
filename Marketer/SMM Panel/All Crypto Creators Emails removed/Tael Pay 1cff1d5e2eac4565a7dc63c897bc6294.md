Description: Tael (ticker WABI) is a digital token used in the Tael ecosystem of safe consumer products. 

Consumer goods inside the ecosystem are secured from counterfeit attempts through banking-level, tamper-proof NFC smart-labels, which are linked to their digital representation on the blockchain. Consumers touch the label with their smartphones to verify a product’s authenticity, discover the product’s journey along the supply chain, and are rewarded for their purchase with the Tael token. 

Tael is used as a payment method across the Tael ecosystem and its partners.
