Description: Welcome to my YouTube Channel!

My name is Stefan and I create educational and beginner-friendly content in the Cryptocurrency space. I come from a Cybersecurity background, where I mentor people which requires me to make very complicated topics easy to understand for beginners. 

I also run a Cybersecurity YouTube Channel under the name Stefan Rows and a Blog (ceos3c.com). 

With this Channel, I want to make Cryptocurrencies accessible for everyone. I know how hard and confusing it can be if you just start looking into this topic. I break down topics in a way beginners can easily digest. 

My tutorials and guides are written in a step-by-step fashion, including pictures and the videos on this YouTube channel.

I won't participate in any FOMO or "BUY COIN XYZ NOW MOONSHOT" shenanigans. The only content you will find on this channel is honest, educational, and high production quality content.

If that sounds good to you, why you don't subscribe?

The blog is at crypto-made-easy.com
