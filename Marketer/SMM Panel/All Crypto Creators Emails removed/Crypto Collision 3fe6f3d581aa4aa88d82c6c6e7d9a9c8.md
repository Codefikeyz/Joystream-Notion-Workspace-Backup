Description: Hey Guys, just want to share my Crypto journey. I've been watching all the crypto channels for two or three months and I finally scraped together 10k for my Bitconnect investment.

If you have been around then you saw Bitconnect crash and now I am trying to find a legit, non lending related crypto income.

If you want to talk or if you have any questions you can email me at CryptoCollision@gmail.com

If you want to donate to me, I'll be your best friend :)
