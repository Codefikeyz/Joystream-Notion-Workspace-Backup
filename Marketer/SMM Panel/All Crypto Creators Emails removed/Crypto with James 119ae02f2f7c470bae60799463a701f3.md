Description: Crypto with James is a cryptocurrency channel for regular people. The channel not only covers well known coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano - but the lesser known ones which tend to go up more in profit.

James is ‘famous’ for predicting Fantom FTM as “the best cryptocurrency of the year” in May 2020 when nobody was talking about it. 

On 24th Feb 2021, Fantom hit $0.84 - 168x higher than when James spoke about it.

As a result, many loyal fans got rather rich in the process!

In total, James has publicly recommended 26 coins on the channel - with a clear message to viewers to BUY. Had you put $100 into each coin when James said you would now be in profit for over $28,000.

(Coins he’s chosen are displayed at the start of every video - and include XRP, Theta, Enjin, Chainlink, Vechain and Zilliqa. These are household coins now, but they weren’t when he first spoke about them!)

James shares every cryptocurrency he’s holding. Want to know what he holds: https://CopyMyCrypto.com
