Description: Trading Forex, stocks, crypto currency or any other market is a very risky business. Many beginners lose their account trying to do it because of one single reason. That is the lack of knowledge. There are many myths out there that are attracting retail traders into this business with the believe that is easy. The story sold out there is simple , learn to put support and resistance lines, to recognize animals in the charts, to use indicators or buy a strategy and you will print money! No one says this is difficult because selling something that is difficult is almost impossible. 
Well here is the HARD TRUTH, it is difficult , you will spend a year learning the basic stuff (I DO NOT ADVICE ANYONE TO BUY ANY COURSE ,SIGNALS, STRATEGY OR ANYOTHER STUFF IN THE FIST YEAR) and you can get that all for free. After a year you will be educated enough to make a decision to become a FULL TIME TRADER or not. If you choose to do so then be ready to learn WAVE THEORY.
