Description: This is Cryptocurrency Education and Product Channel. 

 I make informational and how-to videos about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and financial technology.

My channel is about breaking down complex concepts and processes related to crypto, finance, and economics in ways that are easy for everyone to understand.

Whether you are interested in learning about how bitcoin works or looking to buy altcoins as an investment, subscribe to my channel to learn more about this exciting, new technology.

As you can see, my videos break things down into easy-to-follow steps, so everyone can enjoy. Sharing our journey and helping others make money online.

Videos are NOT offers to buy or sell securities. Videos are not 'buy' or 'sell' signals of any kind.  Investing and trading in cryptocurrencies is VERY RISKY.

Subscribe to my channel and let me know what questions you have about bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, tangle, or any other types of cryptocurrency and I'll be glad to help.
