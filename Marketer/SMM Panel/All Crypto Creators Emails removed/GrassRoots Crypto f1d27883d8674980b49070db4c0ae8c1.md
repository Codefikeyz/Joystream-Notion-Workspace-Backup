Description: GrassRoots Crypto channel is about providing understandable information about Crypto to the average person. 
I am passionate about crypto education and helping people understand the wonderful and confusing world of Crypto.
I know I have a unique style - but that is how I like to learn :)

My current videos are on THORChain - which is good as THORChain is very complex. If you can understand THORChain, most other things are simple. I am open to making videos on other projects. 

If you like my videos and you want to tip me, below are the address.
