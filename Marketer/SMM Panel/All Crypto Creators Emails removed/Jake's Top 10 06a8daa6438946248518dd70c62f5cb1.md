Description: If you like mind-blowing facts, amazing lists and super funny commercials this is the channel for you! Jake's Top 10 is the home of high quality, heartwarming and funny top 10 countdown videos hosted by me, Jake Browatzke!

I (Jake) am a 25 year old Canadian American, born in Saskatchewan, living in sunny California. The first thing you'd notice if you saw me is that I'm 6-foot 6-inches tall. Yes I played basketball, but debate was my passion. In 2012 I became a national high school debate champion here in the United States! Video games are another passion of mine. I've been ranked Top 30 in North America in Blizzard's Hearthstone and played Riot's League of Legends professionally for a year. Fun fact: This channel started as a Call of Duty gaming channel.
