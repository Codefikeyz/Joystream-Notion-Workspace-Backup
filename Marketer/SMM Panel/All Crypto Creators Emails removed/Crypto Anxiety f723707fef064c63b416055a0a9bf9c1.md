Description: Welcome to Crypto Anxiety! Where we try to make easily digestible videos on everything Crypto.  I've been investing in Crypto since 2014, and trading actively since 2015. 

The goal of this channel is to bring you the latest Crypto news from around the World, projects I'm interested in and potential trade opportunities I'm looking at. 

Please do your own research as none of what I say should be considered financial advice. 

Consider subscribing and enjoy!
