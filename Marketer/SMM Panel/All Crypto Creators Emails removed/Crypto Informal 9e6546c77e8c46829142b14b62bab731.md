Description: Welcome To My Channel: Crypto Informal
 The Main Theme Of This Channel is providing information about cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that generally only exists electronically. There is no physical coin or bill unless you use a service that allows you to cash in cryptocurrency for a physical token.
Cryptocurrency works a lot like PayPal or a credit card, except you exchange digital assets for goods and services instead of US dollars. To make a transaction with cryptocurrency, you must exchange currency with a peer using a digital wallet known as a cryptocurrency wallet.
