Description: ATH CRYPTO - Is a service for crypto-enthusiasts made by crypto-enthusiasts. We tried to make the most useful digital bots for everyone who wants to be aware of the events on the crypto market and seeks to make money from it.
We collect analytics and indicators in the field of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and fintech. The list of sources is constantly growing, now it includes more than 300 sites and about 4000 indicators.  The project provides information in 4 languages - Russian, English, German and Spanish. Our plans are to constantly add new language versions to show and earn on the volatility of cryptocurrencies around the world.
"Bitcoin is the best hedge against traditional financial infrastructure. It doesn't matter if you support fiscal or monetary policy - bitcoin will remain a rogue hedge under your mattress," - Chamath Palihapitiya
