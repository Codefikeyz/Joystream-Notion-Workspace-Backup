Description: Welcome to Seatin - Crypto Blockchain Gaming, here we are going to explore the emerging market of Crypto focused "Play To Earn" Blockchain games built around NFTs, there's going to be drama, excitement, scandals, scams and a load of beyond insane news stories to cover. I'm really excited to see if we can find really good Crypto games or if there all just going to be overhyped ponzi schemes. We're going to seperate the gems from the trash, join me in this adventure =)
