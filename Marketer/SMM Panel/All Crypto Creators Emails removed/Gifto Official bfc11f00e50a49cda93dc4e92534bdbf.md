Description: GIFTO - The Decentralized Universal Gifting Protocol for Global Content Creators. 

Asia Innovations Group (“AIG”) is a leading mobile entertainment company in Asia. It has demonstrated that virtual gifting system is a highly effective monetization method for content creators on its flagship live video platform, Uplive. Virtual gifts on Uplive not drive significant revenue for global content creators, but also enhance interactions and relationships between creators and their fans.

The Universal Gifting Protocol draws from the positive Uplive experience, and seeks to enable content producers across any content platform to receive gifts from their fans. These virtual gifts will exist independently from any platform and retain their properties without any centralized controlling mechanism.
