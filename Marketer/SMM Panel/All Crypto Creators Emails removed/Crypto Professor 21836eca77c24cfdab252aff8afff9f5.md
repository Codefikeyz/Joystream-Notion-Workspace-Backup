Description: Hi. I'm Peter Bryant – the Crypto Professor. No, unfortunately, I am not yet a 'real' professor (but my Master's in Psychology is excellent for trading!). I do have 'real world' experience in helping investors with their crypto.

My experiences at an alternative investment firm convinced me that anyone can be profitable with crypto. This channel exists to teach you to profit & avoid the many pitfalls. Whether you're a speculator, blockchain enthusiast or developer, I hope to provide frequent inspiration, critical analysis, & a healthy dose of critical thinking to the newest, hottest & most profitable asset class ever.

If you prefer the more popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Ripple (XRP), great! However, there are a lot of tokens that I am very excited about, such as Syscoin (SYS), Dragonchain (DRGN) or Crypto.com chain (CRO). Watch my weekly in-depth analysis into different crypto called 'InCrypto InDepth' for updates on the next likely crypto profit opportunity!
