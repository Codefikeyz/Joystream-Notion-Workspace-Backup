Description: I'm from the UK, but lived in France for 20 years. I have worked full-time online since 1997. The bulk of my work, over the years,  has been involved with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

In 2018 I was paid for some work with Bitcoin (BTC), I didn't know what to do with it so I just left it on my Kraken Exchange. I looked at it again in 2019 and it had 4x'd in USD value. That was it, I was hooked. I bought as much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as I could.

In 2020 I learned to swing trade and day trade using Binance, Phemex, and ByBit. Since then I have learnt more about De-centralized Finance and Yield Farming.

I started this YouTube Channel to help me understand more about crypto and also create a community of like-minded people. I reached 1000 subscribers on November 26th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who has subscribed.

None of the content is financial advice. Please do your own research when making investment decisions. Do not copy anything I do.

Peace.
