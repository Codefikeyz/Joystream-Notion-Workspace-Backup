Description: Welcome to my Crypto channel, I'm fashioncoder! I have been an investor in crypto for over 3 years. Since my first week of investing I was sold & have believed in crypto & the potential it has. Crypto has changed my life & I want to spread awareness that it can change yours too. This is all about financial freedom. 

A bit of background on me. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. For the past 10 years tech has been at the forefront of my mind. I found a love for coding while in junior high/high school & decided to pursue that in college. I then worked as a software developer & realized that real world coding was a lot different than all the exciting things I learned in school so I went back to school and got an MBA in IT Management. I now work for a tech company as a product owner. 

I love crypto and tech! My goal is to shine some light on this space for people who aren't as technical :)
