Description: Earth has been abandoned after hundreds of years of destructive climate change and catastrophic neglect of the environment by corporations and industry. Political and social unrest has left the old cities decimated and hostile to life. Civilization has collapsed and destroyed itself.

Only obedient first class citizens, were permitted onto the new world. The unworthy who were left behind, - criminals, dissidents and the poor - scavenge in the forgotten cities of the old world, which have become overgrown with jungle, flooded by swamps, swallowed by sand and frozen by ice. Pollution and technological debris litter the environment, and survivors have set up shelter in destroyed skyscrapers, laboratories, abandoned metros and crumbling freeways.

The world is inhabited by criminals, pirates, bounty hunters, slavers, cannibals, mutated creatures, genetic experiments and malfunctioning robots, all competing for resources and territory.

Players can salvage technology and digital currency.
