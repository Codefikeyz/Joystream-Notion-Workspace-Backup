Description: Hello everybody!

Welcome to my channel! My name is Celeste
I'm a 20 something Filipina girl obsessed with growth, improvement, wealth-building, and life!

I used to be a nurse until I became an equity/stock market trader fulltime. I coach traders to perform at the best of their ability too,
so here you'll find your daily dose of Vitamin C!

Classes (about stocks, finances, and others)
Chat with Traders (interviews)
Crossing borders (travel)
Cosmetics (Make-up and beauty)

... and many more!

Check out my other social media and write me a letter! I love meeting people who are at the same direction as my goals.
