Description: Espers is a Proof-Of-Work/Proof-Of-Stake (PoW/PoS) hybrid blockchain that was created to be a solution to the 
division and lack of usability that is currently attributed to blockchain technology,
both unifying and expanding possibilities. Implemented features such as secured messaging, cross-chain interfacing, modular sidechains, websites on the chain, file storage on the chain, to name a few are then joined through a universal interface that any coin project may then participate in.
Using ESP (Espers) coins as “fuel” or a catalyst that drives the services that the chain operates further stimulates the interest in contributing to processing blocks for the network. Miners/Stakers are encouraged to participate causing consistent block generation and ensuring a lightning fast network overall.
