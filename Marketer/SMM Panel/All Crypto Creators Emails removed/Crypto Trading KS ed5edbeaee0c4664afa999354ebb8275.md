Description: Hi, this is Ken from Crypto Trading KS, 7 days a week I bring you the calm, no-hype, and statistical take on crypto. Our community seeks real wealth, happiness, meaning, as well as wealth. As a former lecturer in 1st and 2nd-year Statistics with an actuarial/management consulting background and 30+ years of trading experience, I cut through complexity, misrepresentation, fear to give you an insider's edge. I walk the middle path in my analysis.

Crypto is volatile, always prepare yourself for the best and worst-case scenarios - reality will likely be between them.

Stay safe out there my friends
