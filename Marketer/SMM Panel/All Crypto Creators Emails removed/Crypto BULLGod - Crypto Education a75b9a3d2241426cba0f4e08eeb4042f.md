Description: Aiming to genuinely help educate and teach others regarding charting within the cryptocurrency space.

Whether a pro/novice, I aim to teach in a way that strikes a balance between the two, keeping you informed and engaged.

None of what I am providing is financial advice.

I am very simply put:  looking to educate, help, and spread sound technical analysis to the community to help others in making informed decisions.

When making your own personal financial decisions regarding what to invest in, when to buy, when to sell:  ultimately that ownership falls on you

My hope however, is that you can utilize what I share as another data point in helping you to think through what may be best for your own personal approach.
