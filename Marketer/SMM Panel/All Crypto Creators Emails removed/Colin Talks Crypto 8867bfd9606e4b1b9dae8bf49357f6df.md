Description: I've been in the cryptocurrency space since 2013. Colin Talks Crypto is a cryptocurrency​-focused social media channel, created in June 2018.

My Beliefs:
• Crypto will make the world a better place.
• Cryptocurrency is the vehicle by which mankind can free itself from the abuses of money.

I have watched many bubbles, starting from the Cypress bubble in 2013 when the price of a single Bitcoin reached $255. I next watched the excitement as the price of a single Bitcoin reached $1150 in late 2013. The next bubble was in 2017, when I experienced the price of a single Bitcoin reach $20,000.

I believe there are many more cycles coming like this, and we are still at the beginning stages of this great crypto movement.

I tend to cover the general market and also cryptos that I hold, and thus know more about, such as BTC, ETH, LUNA, BCH, EOS.  I many cover others as well.
