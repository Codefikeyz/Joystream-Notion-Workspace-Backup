Description: "The grass is greener where you water it"
In life we are given what we put out and im a firm believer of that so I started this channel. To help share ideas normally not seen anywhere else that IMO will provide value to not only your trading life but personal life. 
In this channel you will get live technical analysis on the worlds most volatile markets, #cryptocurrency and #forex. You will see advanced Elliott Wave strategies applied that you may not have seen anywhere else and its all done LIVE! I enjoy a live session rather than edited videos because its RAW and I can interact directly with viewers.
