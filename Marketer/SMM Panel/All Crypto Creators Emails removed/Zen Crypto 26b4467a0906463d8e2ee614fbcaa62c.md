Description: Welcome to Zen Crypto, the ultimate fundamentals channel. My name is Evan Ezquer and I am a crypto investor and researcher. 

Enjoy visually stunning videos centered around cryptocurrencies, blockchain, DAG, and all forms of Distributed Ledger Technology in a blissful atmosphere where you can feel at home and relaxed.

I use meditation music for easy comprehension as I am a Zen practitioner.

I approach crypto technology with a mixture of skepticism, awe, and enthusiastic open-mindedness. I am less interested on the short-term market movements and more inclined to the mid to long-term. I value the technology above all.

I am not a licensed financial adviser but an investor who is just sharing his experiences and knowledge so that it could enhance your research and encourage you to dig deeper to this technology.. I advise that you always do your own research.
