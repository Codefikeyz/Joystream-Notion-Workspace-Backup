Description: Fortuna blockchain is the creator of FOTA, a professional derivatives platform.

FOTA has a diverse set of derivative offerings including futures, options, and swaps. All underlying assets are calculated using the FOTA Benchmark Index, which is an average spot price derived from 3 major external exchanges. The Index can be viewed live at any time, which allows us to be transparent and makes manipulation impossible. 

FOTA also boasts, STAMP, the most advanced margin methodology in the cryptocurrency sector on par with the systems used by the CME and the OCC. STAMP considers the overall risk exposure of the entire portfolio, which allows for a reduced margin requirement, a lower probability of liquidation, and reduces the impact of forced liquidation. At the event of liquidation, the remaining margin is returned to the user. No insurance fund. No socialized loss.
