Description: Hello and welcome, On this channel I have a variety of content, lately I have been doing cryptocurrency videos, something that I have taken a shine to in recent months. More particularly I have developed an interest in investing in a privacy coin called DeepOnion. I am passionate about helping the project grow into the best cryptocurrency that it can be. I have also posted some of the videos I made in Film School, as well as a bunch of fun family videos, parodies, and even an old video of me boxing when I was 10 years old. Gotta love the quality of the Video Cameras from the late 1980's.
