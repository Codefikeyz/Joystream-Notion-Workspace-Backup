Description: In the 1990s, Jordan Belfort built one of the most dynamic and successful sales organizations in Wall Street history. His life story has been turned into the blockbuster feature film: The Wolf of Wall Street, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Belfort and directed by Martin Scorsese.

Today, his life represents the ultimate redemption story. After surviving his rise and fall as an American entrepreneurial icon, he is now a world-renowned motivational speaker, author, sales trainer, business consultant, and investor.
The Wolf's Den is Jordan's podcast where he discusses some of the craziest moments of his life, and interviews the biggest celebrities, entrepreneurs, scientists, and anyone else that piques his interest.
