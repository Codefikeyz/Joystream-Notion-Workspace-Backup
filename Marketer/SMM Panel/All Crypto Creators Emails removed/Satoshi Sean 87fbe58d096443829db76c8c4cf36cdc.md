Description: Exploring Crypto, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency. With its effect and disruption of the hegemonic legacy institutions that have thwarted mankind's development for centuries. I'm a single dad of two sets of twins who discovered Blockchain and crypto back in 2016. I knew about Bitcoin and even bought and used some back in 2011 to buy my son a T-shirt online, but just did it as a novelty.  My own "Bitcoin Pizza" regret lol. Once I got into Crypto and Blockchain I saw the huge potential for true freedom for everyone and after being part of the Financial and Insurance Industry for many years, I could see how there could finally be a real shift of power and authority back to the people.
