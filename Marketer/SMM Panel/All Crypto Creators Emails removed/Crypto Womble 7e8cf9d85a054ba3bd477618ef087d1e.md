Description: Welcome to Crypto Womble.

In this new series of shows I am going to explore the goal of becoming Financially Independent.   I will be showing my personal investments, returns and losses on a journey that will no doubt, be full of successes and failures.  This series includes commodities and shares, as well as Crypto staking, holding and trading.

We are in a bear market and I have a bear market investment strategy.  Will it work or will I wake up poorer.  As I wait for the end of the bear market and with the price prediction uncertain, when will the bear market crash end and when I will stop losing money and see market recovery.

Running alongside this I will be publishing videos for new investors and traders.  As both a private (retail) investor and an institutional trader (Trading others money), I feel I can pass on useful information to others.  

Join me on this journey and follow the rollercoaster!

Remember at no point is any of this financial advice.
