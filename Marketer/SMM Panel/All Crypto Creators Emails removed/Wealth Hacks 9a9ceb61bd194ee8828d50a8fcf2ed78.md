Description: This channel teaches you crypto without all the fluff. Whether it is how to buy specific cryptocurrencies, how to find the best opportunities in crypto, or how to find decent coins, this channel is for you. 

I rarely if ever recommend a coin. When I teach how to buy a coin I am not recommending it. I am just showing people how to buy. Please don't consider it a recommendation as many cryptocurrencies will drop in value, perhaps all the way down to zero. 

This channel earns money through affiliate marketing and from ad revenue. Most of the links are likely affiliate links. 

Please note however that most links are to exchanges and products that I'm actually using and I rarely if ever recommend a product I don't use. 

Learning crypto can be hard. It's intense and there is a lot of scams. Let Wealth Hacks teach you how to learn the world of crypto without getting scammed or rug pulled.
