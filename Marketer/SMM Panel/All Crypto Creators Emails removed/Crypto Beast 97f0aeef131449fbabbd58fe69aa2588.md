Description: CryptoBeast

We talk about cryptocurrency, shadow history, the digital lifestyle, wealth, technology, current events. I bring a unique perspective as an Internet pioneer, successful businessman and lifelong amateur historian. Always seeking #truth

I am a technology entrepreneur from New Zealand. Born in the 70's. I wrote HotDog which was the #3 most downloaded software on the Internet in 1997. I have founded several companies which I took public or sold, and have invested in and advised dozens more. Interested in cryptocurrency, blockchain, smart homes.

I have traveled the globe (more than 90 countries) and the US (43 states). I have lived in Silicon Valley on and off for 20 years. In 2017 I returned to New Zealand after 25 years away.
