Description: COIN is the official app for collecting digital currency while sharing location data. Explore the world around you, claim areas, and collect digital assets!

The COIN App enables you to collect digital assets that are dropped (“Geodropped”) at a specific location. You can collect these tokens by pressing the handy pickaxe button, and you’ll reap more rewards when you have a sentinel with you while you travel.
