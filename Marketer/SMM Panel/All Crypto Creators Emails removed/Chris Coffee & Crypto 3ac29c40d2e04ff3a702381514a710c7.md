Hi, I'm Chris. Welcome to my crypto and NFT channel!  I believe that we have more chances to make money from our home right now than ever before and I want to document my journey along the way.

If you're an investor who wants to learn more about specific alt coins, dividends, and NFT's than you should subscribe to my channel. I'll drop weekly videos that focus on the moves I'm making and why I think they are the correct ones for me.

None of this is professional investing advice, I'm just making videos about my journey. 

For my day job I own a coffee shop, roast the coffee for it, manage the employees, do the bookeeping, and everything else you can possibly do. I will be selling coffee bags online and doing giveaways so stay tuned for those!
