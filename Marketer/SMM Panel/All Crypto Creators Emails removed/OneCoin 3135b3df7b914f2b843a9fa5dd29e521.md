Description: OneCoin is a digital currency, based on cryptography and created through a process called 'mining'. Just like the serial number on a paper bill, each digital coin is unique.

Unlike money issued by governments, there is a finite number of OneCoins, ensuring they cannot be affected by inflation and are impossible to counterfeit. Because cryptocurrencies are not tied to any particular country or central bank, the value of the coin depends on factors such as useability, demand and supply.

When joining OneCoin, users become part of a global network of millions of OneCoin miners, who are able to choose among different ways to use their OneCoins. You can mine the coin and benefit from its value. You will also be able to make payments and transfer money to and from any part of the world.

OneCoin's new and unique blockchain will set a new industry standard by storing KYC information, running every minute and is tailored to customer and merchant needs.
