Description: Hi all - glad you're here.

We're here to help you explore the world of crypto and blockchain technology. There are a lot of fluff crypto projects, clickbait video material, and misconceptions about the overall market. 

Our goal is to help you walk away with a better understanding of the rewards, risks and how to navigate this crazy environment. One thing we can say for sure is that there's a lot of wealth yet to be created; you're still early.

None of what we post is financial advise. As always, do your research.
