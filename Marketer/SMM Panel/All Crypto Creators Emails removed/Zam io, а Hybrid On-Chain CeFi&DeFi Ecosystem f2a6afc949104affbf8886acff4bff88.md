Description: Zam.io is shaping the crypto industry today. We are building a hybrid on-chain CeFi&DeFi Ecosystem that bridges real-world capital to blockchain and accelerates the transition to the new decentralized economy.

We create powerful tools that democratize crypto investing and facilitate the migration of equity capital from traditional finance to DeFi. 

$ZAM token is the native utility token that powers Zam.io’s ecosystem. It is used to execute on-chain transactions and pay for network fees. $ZAM token can be transferred across borders, exchanged, staked, and used for liquidity mining. The value of the $ZAM token is backed by revenue generated on the Zamio ecosystem. The token is both ERC20 and BEP20 compatible, with more standards to be added over time.

Join us in shaping the world of crypto!
