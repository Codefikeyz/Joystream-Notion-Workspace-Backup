Description:   Within the channel i will be covering some of the upcoming projects, various guides on possible earning opportunities within the crypto space or just in general guides on possible scams and other tricks that people do.  I do genuinely hope of showing content that to some viewers would be beneficial or would just expand their overall knowledge on the crypto space. 

As of now i will be focusing in 3 main crypto related areas:
-Simple coverage of upcoming crypto projects that seem to be legit and have potential,
-Educational crypto related videos with aim to teach viewer thing or 2,
-Crypto related scams coverage insights on how things was done and if possible what to do next
