Description: This is an Educational channel for all students who belongs to Electronics,Computer science,Information Technology  ,Science and Mathematics field. 
          Being an electronics engineer, I have a good understanding and knowledge about what the student needs the most and will be uploading Video tutorials specifically tailored for students so that they can stay ahead of their competition.
        This channel is not like other conventional educational channel as we intend to teach you much more than what a college or educational institute will teach such as some cool tricks, tips and hacks which will help you get your work done in a smart way.
Also I will like to keep this channel interactive so make sure you subscribe to our channel and drop comments, suggestions and feedback so that we can learn and improve our video content to help you in a better way.
