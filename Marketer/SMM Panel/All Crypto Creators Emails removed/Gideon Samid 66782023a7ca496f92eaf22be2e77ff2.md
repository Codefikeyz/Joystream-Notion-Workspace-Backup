Description: The Crypto Channel on YouTube is the video part of the Crypto Academy featured on WeSecure.net.  It includes Prof. Gideon Samid's video talks that combine to a self taught course aimed at information security officials who need to manage cryptographic tools on their job, and for any one interested in the principles of modern cryptography. The literature is geared either for geeks (overly mathematical), or for dummies (overly simplified). One is hard pressed to find an an intelligent account of modern cryptography aimed not at professional cryptographers, and not at low level security certificate aspirants, but designed to equip the serious cyber security professional in making crypto related decisions in his or her job.  The Crypto Academy, and its videos here are an attempt by the AGS Encryptions Ltd. company to fill this vacuum.  The lectures, slides, audio tracks, articles and books are assembled from live teaching of Prof.Gideon in IT graduate schools, and in commercial setting.
