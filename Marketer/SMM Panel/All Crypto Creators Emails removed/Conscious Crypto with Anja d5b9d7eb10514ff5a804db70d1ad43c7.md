Description: Conscious Crypto is about cryptocurrency for beginners and staying safe in the crypto space. I want to enable you to create a financial future living off the returns of your investments, where you're free to do what you want to do, without worrying about money.

My motivation to teach crypto beginners comes from witnessing the money struggles of many fellow entrepreneurs, most of them women. There’s too many coaches, artists, teachers and healers struggling to make a living with their art. Often they have to get full-time jobs to pay the bills, and end up not bringing their gifts into the world.

I’m here to help you with what cryptocurrency is, buy cryptocurrency, know the best way to store crypto, get the best crypto wallet, start investing in cryptocurrency and earn crypto - yes free crypto! 

We're not here to get rich quick, but to make mindful money decisions to create financial prosperity for ourselves and loved ones.  Start your Plan B for your Pension in my Patreon community.
