Description: Welcome to my channel! I focus on DeFi yield farming strategies (mostly using stablecoins) so we can earn passive income with our crypto assets. Crypto doesn't have to be "buy and hope it goes up," you can actually make your dollars work and outperform most market participants/traders.

To get in contact with me, DM me on Twitter or email me at taikI@coba.coffee!
