Description: The best Crypto Fun Stuff on the Web! 

Educational and random videos covering all kinds of fun topics that I am interested in and spend a lot of time researching. 
I got an educational platform over at https://academy.anyo.io/ where I am building out courses on Blockchain, Crypto and Tech. These are free for you to engage with and is my way of helping bridge the gap of knowledge in the world. Enjoy.
