Description: I choose to take the risky and wild ride of crypto investing.  Some call us crazy, some call us risky, but what they will call us all later, is "rich".  Well, at least those who make solid decisions on the cryptos with great fundamentals.  I'm not a financial advisor, just an investor myself, and created this channel to share with you what has worked well for me as well as be able to speak to the projects and teams that are guiding the ships out there, and access the information early about the big things coming so that we all can benefit from that information to make even better choices.
