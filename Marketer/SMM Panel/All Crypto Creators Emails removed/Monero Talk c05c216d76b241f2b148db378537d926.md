Description: Monero Talk broadcasts weekly conversations with topical guests to understand what the Monero cryptocurrency is today and what it hopes to become. 

Guests include:
The developers and researchers working on the open source core protocol and the cryptography behind it; 
The people building the projects and infrastructure supporting the protocol; 
Privacy advocates and people building privacy enhancing technologies;
Analysts and investors speculating on Monero's growth;
Journalists and pundits weighing in on Monero's place in the crypto-sphere; and 
Respected (sometimes controversial) contributors and community members.

We strive to give birth to new Monero users by simply reporting on the facts in our search to answer the question--Is Monero the truest cryptocurrency of them all?

If you enjoyed the show & would like to support us, a donation of any size would be greatly appreciated!
