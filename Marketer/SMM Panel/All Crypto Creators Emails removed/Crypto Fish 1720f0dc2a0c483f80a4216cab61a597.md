Description: Interested in the next big coin to mine?  Maybe what the best cryptocurrency miner is?  I go over various topics in the cryptocurrency space including fresh new coins to mine, what the best miners are for particular algorithm's, graphics card comparisons and much more.

I also have a unique contest where I give away Bitcoin every Friday and a new contest called Bitcoin Roulette where I give away Bitcoin in every video.  Be sure to subscribe and click the notification bell so you won't miss your chance at some Free Bitcoin.

Best Regards and thanks for stopping by,
