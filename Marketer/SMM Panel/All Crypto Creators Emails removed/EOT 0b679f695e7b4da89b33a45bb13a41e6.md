Description: EOT - “Encryption of Things”, a UTILITY COIN with a strong use case.

EOT, a peer to peer payment system with new blocks being mined every 90 seconds thus ensuring fast and efficient transactions.
  
EOT was developed for the purpose of encrypting devices and applications connected to the internet, IoT, known as the “Internet of Things”.   

It is estimated that around 30 Billion “Internet of Things” devices will be connected to the internet by 2020.  The overall IoT market is projected to be worth more than one billion U.S. dollars annually from 2017 onwards. IoT needs EOT.

These devices will need encryption otherwise they would attract the attention of hackers intent on cybercrime.  Privacy, security, and encryption are a necessity to protect our digital footprint in our growing digital economy.
 
EOT, Protecting the Connected.
