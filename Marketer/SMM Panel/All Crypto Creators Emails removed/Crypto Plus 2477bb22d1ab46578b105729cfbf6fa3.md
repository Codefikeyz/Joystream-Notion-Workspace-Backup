Description: DeFi, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Crypto & Bitcoin are names now synonymous with the future of finance.

These futuristic forms of currency, platforms and financial instruments exist today, but are truly little known to the general public. Yes most people have heard of Bitcoin but what about Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Cardano, Stellar, Chainlink, Uniswap and the much derided Dogecoin.

Only those who are already immersed within the Defi and Crypto universe will be familiar with these names. 

The problem however, is that most people who talk about these 'coins' on social media, are 'pumpers' who have bought into these products and are encouraging others to do the same so their price rises and they can make a huge profit.

Well, this channel will reveal the truth about cryptocurrencies, cover important issues about Defi (DeFinance) , and other investment forms.

The orator, though no longer a practitioner due to retirement, is highly qualified in Banking, Wealth Management & Investments.
