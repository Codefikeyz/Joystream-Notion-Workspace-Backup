Description: Made all my money in eCommerce back in 2016, selling over $50,000,000 in sales in 4 years. Became an early stage angel investor and was able to use my copywriting, design, and marketing skills to help grow projects. Now my goal is to help you find early stage crypto projects so that we can invest together. Most Crypto influencers get early access, shout it out to their followers, and then dump their bags... this is not cool and needs to stop. I want to invest WITH my followers so we win together!
