Description: Hey guys, Crypto Academy is the place where you can get Trading tutorials, how-to videos, price predictions, undervalued gems, useful financial content and information focusing on Cryptocurrency. Here, you can learn fundamental and technical analysis. I’ll teach you all the indicators, oscillators and moving averages.  I have been in crypto since bitcoin was below $26k, Etherium under $1k, Cordano under $0.30 and BNB under $30. I have enough experience to educate you. Get into my ship, we will continue our journey together to the Cryptoverse. Come be the part of our community that we call Crypto community. Thankyou.
