Description: I want to invite you on a journey with me into cryptocurrency and investing that I've been on since the summer of 2016. One of my goals is to help mentor you by sharing my journey and experiences with you. Let's learn together. Consider being part of my story. I'd love to hear from you. 

This channel is not about giving financial advice or what new ICO to invest in. The purpose of a mentor is to help coach, encourage and assist you in your own cryptocurrency journey. I'll be adding new videos along my journey.
