Description: Hi all,

Those who followed me from the beginning probably know that I have been making more money with cryptos than stocks.

But the monthly dividend stocks has been good to me as it provides me a monthly cashflow where I can use it to invest in crypto's that can have a big moon shot.

The crypto market is still pretty young, in my opinion. There are a lot of new markets that are being born here in the crypto space.

Things are looking very unique for the future. The Defi and NFTs markets keep on developing.

We got an NFTs DeFi gaming market in the making.

There are so many things happening right now, so many things that are being developed on Ether, Cardano, Binance, Solana, Polygon, etc.

I decided to focus all of my time on research and finding the gems I could invest in.
