Description: Hello and welcome, dear Crypto enthusiast. You have finally found the angriest and most brutal crypto channel on YouTube, congratulations! The host, Sebastian, is not holding back: Almost 10 years of experience in the crypto markets, have transformed him into a completely angry Psychopath. Therefore, expect some solid crypto technical analysis, intermixed with crazy rants, and other angry or rude behavior. The focus of this channel lies on long-term Bitcoin and Altcoin analysis, and especially the interaction with other asset classes, such as stocks or bonds. There is a lot to talk (and of course rant) about, therefore I do daily videos. I would be happy if you would join me in great anger on this journey, dear friend of crypto currencies!
