Description: Hey We are Crypto Tech. I have a huge passion for innovation and investing, and I felt YouTube had lots of great videos about them. 

But as I was trying to learn more about more niche topics like crypto, I realized it was much more difficult to find good content. So I teamed up with some skilled friends and started my own YouTube channel. 

Crypto Tech was born as a place to learn about finance, crypto, and business innovation. Our goal is to help investors, entrepreneurs, and anyone looking to become financially smarter in today’s changing economy.

You will find financial, entrepreneurial, and business wisdom from bright minds such as Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, Robert Kiyosaki, Jim Rickards, Nassim Taleb, Warren Buffet, Jim Rogers, Ray Dalio, Peter Schiff, and many more. Every week, we publish videos to help you master the transformation of the world we're living in. 

Join us on our journey to the future of finance.
