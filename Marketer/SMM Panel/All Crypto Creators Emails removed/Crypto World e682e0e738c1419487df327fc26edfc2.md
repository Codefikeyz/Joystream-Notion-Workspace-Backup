Description: Hi, friends! I'm  Wolfoo Dance ! I create funny videos with different Fnf dance variations. My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: First I record where I play Friday Night Funkin and come up with a new idea. Then I use Adobe After Effects, cut out unnecessary moments, add unique sound and video effects.

All my video features materials protected by the Fair Use guidelines of Section 107 of Copyright Act. It takes about 2-3 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.

The audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer hears and sees the new UNIQUE content.
