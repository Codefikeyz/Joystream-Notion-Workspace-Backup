Over the past few years, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has become so great that the words "bitcoin", "ether" or "mining" can be heard from people who are very far from the world of cloud technologies.

To start investing in a completely unfamiliar market means to waste money. A competent investor always starts by studying the investment and asset market. Fundamental and technical analysis is used to study the virtual money market, as in traditional trading.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is always a risk. In addition, the cryptocurrency is strongly tied to demand. That is, if large market players buy certain coins for a certain time, it moves the market in one direction or another. Volatility and speculativeness are the main risks of the cryptocurrency market
