Description: The Breakdown is a daily podcast covering big shifts in economics and power around the world. Are we headed into a deflationary or an inflationary period? Is the Federal Reserve and other central banks too involved in economies? Has the global monetary order based around the US dollar outlived its usefulness? What role does bitcoin (BTC) have in building a new system? These questions and more, everyday on The Breakdown. 

The Breakdown is hosted by Nathaniel Whittemore (NLW) and distributed by CoinDesk.
