Description: http://www.bitstern.com - Mobile gaming, apps and daily news!

Cheeeeeeery-i-o!

We play and review mobile games! It's all about iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Android apps - we love indie games! 

Crossy Road gameplay videos, secret characters unlocks, announcements, KetchApp games or the next Flappy Bird: It's all here!
Occasionally there will be tech, game & gadget news and a few tutorials, too.

Looking forward to your comments, the world is ours! Tschooooooooos

For GAME DEVELOPERS & VIDEO CREATORS: 

If you are a indie dev and want to release your own video, send us a request for the indie gamecast series.
If you want to release your game trailer on our channel, send us your trailer along with a Full HD picture for release!

Submit a review request, provide us with a promocode and we might get back to you or review your game! Currently we can only review games for iOS devices, we plan to change this in the future.
