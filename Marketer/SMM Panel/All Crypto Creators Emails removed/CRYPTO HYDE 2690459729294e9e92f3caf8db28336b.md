This is exactly what i feel in my point of life rn. Like everybody's moving fast with their life, already achieve a lot of things, travel a lot of places, or already have families of their own. And here i am, still on the same place after i graduated college, being left behind. Keep doing the same things just to stay and keep up with the others. Feeling pressure with this life, but still hoping for the best in the future.
