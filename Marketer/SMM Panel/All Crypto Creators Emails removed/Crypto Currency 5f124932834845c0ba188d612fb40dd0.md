Description: We love crypto and think it truly will reshape the world.  Mining, trading and growing our crypto portfolios is our passion and we hope to provide detailed guidance for people trying to do the same.  Feel free to recommend specific video topics to cover and we're working on a ton of new content including coverage on the basics of crypto - buying, selling, trading, and safe storage practices, as well as exchange reviews including some nifty decentralized exchanges, all while expanding our mining farm.  

If you are in need of some guidance regarding serious mining operations/farms - I am available for consulting appointments.  Send inquiries to email below.  Thanks,
