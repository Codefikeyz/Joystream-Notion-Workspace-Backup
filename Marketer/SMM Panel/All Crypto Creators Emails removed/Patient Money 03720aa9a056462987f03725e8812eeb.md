"The stock/crypto market is a tool for transferring money from the impatient investor to the patient investor"  ~~Warren Buffet

My name is Selorm Dzaka, I have an MBA and a Bachelors in Business Information Systems. I have been active in Crypto/stock market for over 8 years now and I plan on sharing some tips for beginners. My strength is my ability to leave emotions at the door while investing and also avoiding FOMO (fear of missing out) or revenge trading. These, coupled with proper due diligence is a recipe for success. Do well to subscribe and remain positive. I am not a financial advisor. Everything I say on this channel is my personal opinion.
