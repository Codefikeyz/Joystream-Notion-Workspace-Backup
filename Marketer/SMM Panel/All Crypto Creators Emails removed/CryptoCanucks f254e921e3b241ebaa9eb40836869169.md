Description: The official YouTube channel of CryptoCanucks - 

CryptoCanucks started as a group of friends in Toronto, learning about the rapidly evolving blockchain & cryptocurrency industry.  Our group stems from various backgrounds including Software Development, Forex Trading, Finance & Digital Marketing. After officially launching on July 1st 2017, Canada’s 150th Anniversary, we are quickly growing our audience and influential reach month after month. 

The CryptoCanucks mission is to become the go to resource for all blockchain or cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, beginners & experts, with a primary focus on Canadian projects. The industry we have tapped into is still a very young and developing sector, which allows us to position ourselves for the influx of users that will be looking for an authoritative and resourceful hub to further their understanding of cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, and blockchain technology.
