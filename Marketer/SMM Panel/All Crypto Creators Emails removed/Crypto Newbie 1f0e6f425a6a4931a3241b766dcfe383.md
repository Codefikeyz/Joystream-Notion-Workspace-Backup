Description: My name is Travis and my goal is to provide you content that helps you navigate the world of cryptocurrency.  I, like many of you, was new to the cryptocurrency space and learned many lessons the hard way.  This channel is my attempt to help you avoid the mistakes I made.  How my channel differs from others in the space is my background.  I have an MBA as one of two Master's Degrees, and I have started my doctorate in business.  I am NOT a financial advisor and my content should not be viewed as financial advise.

Warren Buffett is attributed as saying, “if you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”  Cryptocurrency can help produce a revenue stream while you sleep, but it can also result in significant losses.
