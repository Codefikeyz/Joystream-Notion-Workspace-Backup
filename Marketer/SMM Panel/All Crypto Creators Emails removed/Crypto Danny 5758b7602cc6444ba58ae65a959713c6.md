Description:    Hello and welcome to my channel. Mostly what you will find here is information that has to do with Eureka Blockchain. Eureka Coin is the native coin of the Eureka blockchain and can be used several ways to earn a passive income. From now on I will be doing many videos on a website called Eureka Stake where you can earn free Eureka Governance tokens just by staking your ERK on the site. Also I will be doing more and more reviews of Dapp's that are coming out on the Eureka Blockchain that will include some simple games all the way to massive projects. IPX Eureka DeFi ecosystem will be one of those massive projects that will be made simple for people without even a high degree of technical knowledge to be able to build their own DeFi lending Dapp. Also they are working on now Decentralized Cloud storage as well as 4 different kinds of decentralized social media platforms. The Eureka Blockchain and the Development company Polaris Universal are both pretty amazing.
