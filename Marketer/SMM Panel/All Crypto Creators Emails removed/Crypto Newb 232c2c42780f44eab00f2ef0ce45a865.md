Description: Everyday Tech Vids is a YouTube channel focused on helping the everyday person select tech devices to buy, and we help people use the tech they have now! We review and do tutorials on an assortment of tech, everything from tablets, phones, headphones iphones, androids, cameras, gadgets and computers! 

I've been involved with selling phones and tech since 2007. I began back in the stone age when smartphones weren't in every 4 year old's hand ;)

I sold phones from 2007-2015 and also worked in repair for over two years. I've got a wealth of knowledge on the subject and I'm sharing it with you fine people!
