Description: Hey CryptoLand, I'm "Black Crypto". In early 2017, I built a Bitcoin mining farm in my home & started documenting the journey. From past scams/hacks to my own mistakes, I've seen it all and now you don't have to.

I'm also a developer & taught over 15 IT & Computer Graphics courses as a college professor.  Thank you for allowing me to guide you through your cryptocurrency journey & avoid potential pitfalls ahead.
