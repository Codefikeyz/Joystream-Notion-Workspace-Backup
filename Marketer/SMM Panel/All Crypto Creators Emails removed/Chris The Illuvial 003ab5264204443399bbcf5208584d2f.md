Description: New to Crypto? Want financial freedom from fiat currencies? Interested in NFT Gaming? Love Illuvium? As do I. You can expect high-quality, in-depth, and easy-to-understand videos from Chris The Illuvial. I post weekly videos all about the highly anticipated NFT game Illuvium! My goal is to help beginners not feel intimidated by crypto-currency as I did. So there is no such thing as a "dumb" question when it comes to the comment section on my videos! Last but not least, welcome and thank you for joining us. Now it's time to fight for ETH.

A little more about me:
I'm 23 years old located in the United States! I've always been intrigued by crypto but had my suspicions about it. It wasn't until April 2021 that I would buy my first crypto, Dogecoin: that I would begin to learn what real crypto was. I immediately sold my Dogecoin and bought Cardano, and the rest was history.
