Description: The Conscious Poker YouTube helps poker players win more money, move up in stakes and crush the competition.

For the last 15 years, I've been a pro poker player and coach, traveling full time and playing the biggest games on the planet. I've made over $3,000,000 playing tournaments, but my main focus has always been cash games. In Macau, I've been known to play the extreme nosebleed games, where you bet a car and get raised a house! 

I share the best of what I've learned, analyzing the most amazing poker hands from readers like yourself and in games I've played. I also answer your poker questions on my AskAlec show.

For more resources and my best content, check out my poker training site www.ConsciousPoker.com and download my free 'Intro to Hand Reading'. You'll get access to the exact thought process I use in each hand of poker I play, weekly poker tips and exclusive content.
