Description: Paolo Coletti, mathematician, programmer, crypto technologist and finally data analyst.
In my channel you'll find two lines of videos: (1) videos on personal finance and crypto (2) my lessons at unibz on finance, data organization (Excel, relational databases), data analysis (R, perhaps some SPSS) and programming (Python). All my university's courses are completely covered by videos... yes, it was like that even BEFORE Covid-19.
