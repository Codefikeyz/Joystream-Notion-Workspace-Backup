Description: Join Pony, Lion, Panda, and Chikun on their adventures in the Magical Crypto Friends world!

Riccardo Spagni , Samson Mow 女, WhalePanda , and Charlie Lee  discuss the hottest topics surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The podcast covers the latest news in the space, as well as technical questions and specific projects such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and others.

None of this is investment advice, and everybody should do their own research. But you should buy bitcoin!
