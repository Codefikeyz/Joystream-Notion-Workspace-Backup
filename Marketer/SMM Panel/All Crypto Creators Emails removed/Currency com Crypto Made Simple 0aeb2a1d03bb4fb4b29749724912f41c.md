Description: Hi, we’re Currency.com, and we’ve built the world’s first regulated tokenised securities platform. It’s time to change the game.

The Currency.com platform will revolutionise cryptocurrency investment by enabling anyone with Bitcoin or Ethereum to trade financial assets from the world’s biggest companies – without putting their crypto holdings under price pressure or moving to fiat. All with the security, trust and precision of blockchain.

The Currency.com team are driven by a vision to democratise investment, taking it from the preserve of a privileged few in first-world states and making it available across the globe. We believe successful investors contribute significantly to society – leading to a more secure and stable world.
