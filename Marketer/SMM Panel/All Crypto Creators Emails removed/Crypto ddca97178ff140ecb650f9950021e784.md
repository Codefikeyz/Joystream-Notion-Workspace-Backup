Description: Hello I'm Crypto.

Did you know Planet Earth has one of the most renowned and prestigious music scenes in the whole universe? It's true. And we all tune into it. Why do you think Elon Musk keeps sending all these satellites into orbit...

I, Crypto decided to embark on a musical journey, leaving my home planet to write and release music for Humans. I'm travelling through the ages, picking out my favourite songs, and putting my own outer-worldly twist on them.
