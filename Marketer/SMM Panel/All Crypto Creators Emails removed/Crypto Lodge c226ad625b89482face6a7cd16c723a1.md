Description: NOTE: As I do not (and will never) turn on ads, donations keep the Lodge alive: 0xb25420bDE26ae36578563079aa7AfB8b590E48d7 (MetaMask)

DeFi protocols, Tomb Forks, Altcoins, etc .. 
On blockchains like Fantom, Avalanche, Cronos, BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Polygon DeFi and Tomb Forks -- we even explore new up-and-coming layer 1 blockchains. 

It's the BEST PLACE TO BE and once you join you'll never look back!

I'm a crypto dev / consultant and I give my opinions on the cryptocurrency market from Bitcoin and Ethereum, Fantom and Avalanche DeFi, new tomb forks that seem safe and promising, layer 1 EVM chains on the rise, brilliant DeFi protocols on the rise and of course my deep dives into DeFi protocols that the community seems to enjoy.

Nothing in any of my videos should be taken as financial advice. I simply give my opinions on DeFi, Tomb Forks, Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, altcoins and even advanced TA coverage on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
