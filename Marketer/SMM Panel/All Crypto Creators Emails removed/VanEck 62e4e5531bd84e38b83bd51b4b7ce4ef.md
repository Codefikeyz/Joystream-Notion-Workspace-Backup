Description: Providing investors access to opportunities that will strengthen their portfolios is VanEck’s guiding principle. Through forward-looking, intelligently designed active and ETF solutions, we offer exposures to emerging industries, asset classes and markets as well as differentiated approaches to traditional strategies.

We look beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. VanEck was one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets and recognized early the transformative potential of gold investing, emerging markets and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
