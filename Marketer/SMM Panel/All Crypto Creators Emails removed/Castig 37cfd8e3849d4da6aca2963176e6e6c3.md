Description: Chris Castiglione makes videos about coding, the internet, and social impact. On this channel you can expect to find ideas about books and ideas that are changing the world for the better. 

On Books is a podcast where we talk about books. Think of it as a two-person book club — or a series of thirty-minute audiobooks. Each week on the show host Chris Castiglione brings you a new book. Highlights include: Mating in Captivity, Sapiens, Sex at Dawn, Letters to a Young Poet, Educated, How Not to Die, Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit, Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, as well as exclusive interviews with Neil Strauss,  Haruki Murakami, Kevin Kelly, Peter Singer and more.
