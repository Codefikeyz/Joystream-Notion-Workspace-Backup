Description: My name is Jason and I have been obsessed with Entrepreneurship and Investing since I was a little kid.  My grandpa first got me into investing when I was just 11 and I fell in love with figuring out creative ways to have my money work for me.  Fast forward to 2016 I found out about Crypto and had built my first Ethereum Mining Rig.  Since then I have found a huge fascination with everything Blockchain and have pretty much done everything in Crypto (Anywhere from mining, NFTs, creating coins, farming, launchpads, airdrops, and so much more).   I realized that Crypto is going to be SO BIG and that there's a lot of people out there that just don't know anything about it. 

I decided to use my passion of Crypto and Entrepreneurship by starting a channel and helping others learn more about what Cryptocurrency has to offer!  Even though I'm not the type of guy to make content, or even just simply post stuff on Social Media, I realized I could really help others and I had to start!
