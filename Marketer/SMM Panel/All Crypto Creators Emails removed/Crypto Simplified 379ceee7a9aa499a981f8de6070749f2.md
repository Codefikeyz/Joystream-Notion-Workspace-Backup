Description: This channel is about making the world of crypto currencies easy to understand and get your head around. I'll Make difficult topics understandable. I'll do my best to simplify crypto currencies so things make sense and so you can make use of this amazing new technology. You don't need to be a programmer to understand crypto and you don't need to be a genius. All you need is common sense. I'll make step by step tutorials to give you a foundation to your crypto journey. This channel is about sharing our knowledge as a community in the crypto world. I would like to introduce new promising tokens with interesting use cases. Also I would like to investigate how to do basic things that may seem obvious to a crypto veteran but so hard for a newbie. All in all I'm hoping to create a community where we can all help each other. Good luck on our crypto journey!
