Description: At The Iconist we aim to cover the deeper stories in the crypto world. Rather than focusing on today’s prices and questions like “When moon?”, we look deeper at the people behind the projects and the forces moving the markets. We focus on what’s really going on within the ICON Republic.

Halfway through our first year we’ve already interviewed industry influencers like Alex Tapscott, and leaders within the ICON ecosystem like Min Kim, JH Kim, Ricky Dodds and Josh Choi. The Iconist has also interviewed key players like TRIVE, No Rest Labs, Deblock and the brains behind DApp projects like Carboneum, VELIC, AC3, STAYGE, weBloc and Zensports. We tapped our network to talk to ICON engineers and put our investigative skills to the test by unravelling the real story behind ICON’s 18% jump in circulating supply and the $5M buyback.
