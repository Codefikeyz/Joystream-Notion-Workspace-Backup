Description: The Crypto Couch is where we humanize cryptocurrency and blockchain. Crypto Tutors is bringing crypto to the culture on the Crypto Couch by elevating the voices and faces of the diverse trail-blazers behind the technology in an educational, yet entertaining way (think Breakfast Club for crypto!). Our mission is to empower minorities by simplifying crypto and blockchain in order to transform knowledge into wealth.
