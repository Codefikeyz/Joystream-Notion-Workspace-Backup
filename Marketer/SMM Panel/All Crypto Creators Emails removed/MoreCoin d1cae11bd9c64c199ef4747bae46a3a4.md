Description: Welcome to the MoreCoin Channel where we talk about investing in Crypto currencies, news and my opinions on Terra, Avax Avalanche, Solana and more!!

Here I do Crypto currency Yield Farming Reviews and Tutorials For a wide variety of DeFi applications.

The goal of this channel is to investigate crypto projects thoroughly while adding a little bit of humor. I want to give you more than just a fundamental and data-driven point of view. I love catching pumps, but understanding what a project does well and how it can succeed moving forward is important and allows me to have a stronger conviction with the Coins and Tokens I own.

I hope you like and subscribe to my channel. I also have a twitter account where you can get the most current news and information that I find as well as just funny crypto memes and stories 
 

None of this is EVER, EVER financial or investment advice!!!!!!!!
