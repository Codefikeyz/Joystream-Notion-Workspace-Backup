Description: Welcome to our YouTube channel! At Bankex, we build Internet of Assets (IoA) — a decentralized network which evaluates assets automatically and instantly. It greatly contributes to the development of a new digital asset trading industry.
Our BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service) platform applies Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to appraise assets as well as improve the liquidity of assets expeditiously.
