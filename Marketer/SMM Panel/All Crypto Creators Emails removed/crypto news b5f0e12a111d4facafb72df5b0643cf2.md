Description: How to Answer "How Do You Define Success?”
The best approach to answering this question is to reference specific examples of your successes and explain the factors that contributed to your achievements. Then share how you applied what you learned from each experience to continue your professional development and generate positive results.

You could reference a time when you led a team that was able to deliver a product ahead of schedule. Describe the steps that were taken to ensure that high quality was maintained despite the accelerated schedule.

You could then share how you recognized each team member's efforts and how you and your staff were able to implement the same technique with future deliverables. For example, you might say:

"I like to maintain a consistent level of productivity and take both my successes and failures in stride. I try to learn from both and apply that knowledge to future situations.
