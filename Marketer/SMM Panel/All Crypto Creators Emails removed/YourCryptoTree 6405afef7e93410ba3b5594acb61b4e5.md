Description: The crypto world is being taken over by the Drip Network. Individuals and families are opening Drip accounts. Drip users regularly share stories of how they pay tuition fees for their children, pay huge medical bills for their friends, and create accounts for the future of their children.

Because of its ability to sustainably pay a 1% return every day, the Drip Network has garnered a great deal of attention from the crypto community. DRIP is the only daily ROI token that pays stakers and referrers from a tax on transactions and not from inflation!
