Description: Are you someone who is interested in cryptocurrency and is looking to get behind the scenes insight into cryptocurrency trading, investing, tools and behind the scenes interviews?

Are you struggling to capitalize on the information that is already out there, because 99% of people already know what you know?

If you want behind the scenes action and to learn from someone elses experience in terms of what works and what doesn't, then this is the channel for you. No BS, no hype, just the journey, tools and education you need to stay informed.

You will get lots of benefits by walking this journey including:

 - education on aspects of crypto trading which are not commonly talked about
 - behind the scenes on our own community product development, including the crypto wizards market scanning tool for arbitrage and momentum
 - exclusive interviews
 - valueable market analysis and discussion
