Description: This has become my page for watching the BLM protests and the Antifa riots. It was once the place I put all my B-side videos and cyrpto-currency. In this channel I want to spread accurate information and call out extremists on both sides. The narrative I produce should be that of reason. 

The truth is that there are big issues we are dealing with. Cost of housing in Canada/USA is insane compared to the same prices twenty years ago in every location. Health-Care in the USA is just stupid high. Education is expensive and often gets you nothing and nowhere. Police murdering people has got to stop. Same with Civil Forfeiture. At the same time, protesters need to keep off of the roads, stop burning things down and open a narrative with leaders instead of melting down and having fits.

Join me. Catch me on my mistakes. Join the conversation in the comments. But please don't use the F word or Google will remove your comments.
