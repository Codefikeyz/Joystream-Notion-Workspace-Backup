About the host:
I first got introduced to crypto back at the beginning of 2016 when I joined the Jaxx wallet team as a Product designer (Later Creative Director). Back then, Ethereum was around $6.00-$12.00 USD, and crypto space was comparatively small. As an immigrant, I got immediately intrigued with the technology and its philosophy of giving people back control of their finances. Since then, I've been actively studying crypto space, blockchain, and their evolution.
