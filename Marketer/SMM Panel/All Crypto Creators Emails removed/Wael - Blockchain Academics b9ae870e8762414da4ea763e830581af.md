Description:   WELCOME TO MY CRYPTOCURRENCY CHANNEL! 

I’m a 27 year old full time crypto currency trader and expert analyst who travels the world attending events while continuing to learn about new projects & staying on top of the latest trends in trading. I’ve been involved full time in the crypto space since 2017.  I’ve spoken internationally at various crypto currency events & pride myself on being an honest educator who is dedicated to my craft!

I founded this channel to spread the word about cryptocurrencies and to hopefully help some of you become educated & informed by providing you solid advice on how to build your portfolio by providing you with solid projects to invest in.

My greatest hope is that you too can trade your way to being the next crypto millionaire!
