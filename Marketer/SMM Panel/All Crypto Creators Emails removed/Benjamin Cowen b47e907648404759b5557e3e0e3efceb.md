Description: You have just jumped into the cryptoverse, which provides high quality cryptocurrency education to those who want to dive deeper into the metrics that are driving the market. We all know that there are thousands of people/websites discussing cryptocurrencies, so what makes this different? Many sites discuss cryptocurrencies solely in the form of memes and catchy slogans. Analysis is typically limited to price and price predictions, rather than looking at metrics that drive the price. As an academic, I approach cryptocurrency from a practical perspective and use my science/engineering/programmatic background to package these metrics in an easily digestible way for the community. I try and keep a level head with my discussions and provide you information that is helpful to you as you research different coins.
