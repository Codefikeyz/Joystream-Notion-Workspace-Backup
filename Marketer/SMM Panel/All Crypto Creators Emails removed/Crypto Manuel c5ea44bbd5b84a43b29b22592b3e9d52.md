Description: Hello, Curious Investor & Bitcoin enthusiast.
My name is Emmanuel, I'm a Crypto trader & infopreneur and I've come to realise a few things in my Cryptocurrency journey so far...

▫️ Even though Bitcoin is on the rise and it's becoming mainstream and conventional, a lot of people still have little to no idea what or how bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies work.

▫️ With Bitcoin ATMs & bank cards out and already functional in some parts of the world, it is only going to drive up the price and that is a plus for those who already have bitcoin.

▫️ You need to get in on this and start becoming educated on how bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are changing the game and could inevitably take over the banking systems.
