Description: Everything about crypto, web3 and metaverse. I review apps, blockchains, coins, as well as report news and talk about meta-aspects of crypto investing (no financial advice ever, DYOR!).

I'm a PhD in mathematics, former Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, listed on Forbes 30 under 30 for my previous tech startups.
