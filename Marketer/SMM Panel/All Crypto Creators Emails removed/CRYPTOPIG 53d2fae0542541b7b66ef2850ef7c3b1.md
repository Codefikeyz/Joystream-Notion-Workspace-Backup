Description: Welcome to CryptoPig. Please read the following information to find out more about us and get acquainted with your new favorite channel.

CryptoPig is NOT sponsored. We are a group of over a dozen analysts, reviewers, traders and most importantly crypto loving friends who joined together because we found it harder and harder to find trustworthy advice and research in the crypto space. 
Many of us have worked in blockchain for years, some of us have been buying Bitcoin since 2013.
We love crypto, and we believe this technology will change the world. But it’s important to stay safe, and that is why CryptoPig was born.

The whole group will check every post before it goes live. We will be honest as to whether we are investing and why.

We’ll give you trustworthy advice and help you navigate this crazy industry.
