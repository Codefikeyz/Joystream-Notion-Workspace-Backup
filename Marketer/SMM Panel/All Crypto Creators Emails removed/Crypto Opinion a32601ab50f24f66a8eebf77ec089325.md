Description: There are a lot of crypto scams out there. On this channel I give my personal opinions on some of the latest cryptocurrency projects to hopefully save you some time and heartache. These videos are not professional financial advice and my judgments could be incorrect. 

Every video on this channel is just my opinion. I encourage you to do your own research before making investment decisions.
