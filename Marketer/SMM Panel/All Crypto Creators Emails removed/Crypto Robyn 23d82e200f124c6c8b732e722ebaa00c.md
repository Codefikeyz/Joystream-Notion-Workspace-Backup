Description: Hey there! I’m Crypto Robyn and I specialise in putting in the research to bring you my take on new blockchain projects.

I’m a teacher, casual writer and have always been fascinated by technology. I’ve been on the crypto train since my boyfriend converted me earlier this year and am constantly amazed by the innovation here in the space.

I’m no expert by any means but I love tech, I love to teach and I love to write, so I’ll be giving you my opinions on new blockchain-based projects in my spare time.

Subscribe and welcome aboard!
