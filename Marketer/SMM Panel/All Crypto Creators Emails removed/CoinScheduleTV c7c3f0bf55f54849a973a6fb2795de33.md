Description: We provide all of the blockchain-related intelligence people need in one place. We do the hard work to aggregate data from multiple sources and then use our proprietary algorithms and crowd intelligence to curate, rank and organise it. Critically, this includes our proprietary TrustScore, which assesses dozens of elements of a project and is immune to manipulation. Developed with scientists from the University of Oxford, our TrustScore aims to set the global standard for trust and transparency. 

Through our fast and engaging interface, users are able to interact with this intelligence and the blockchain community – and, importantly, are rewarded for their contribution. Ultimately, we enable individuals and companies to effectively navigate the blockchain space and make better decisions.

Founded by early blockchain pioneers in 2016, and based in Oxford (UK), CoinSchedule is one of the most recognised and trusted information providers to the blockchain community.
