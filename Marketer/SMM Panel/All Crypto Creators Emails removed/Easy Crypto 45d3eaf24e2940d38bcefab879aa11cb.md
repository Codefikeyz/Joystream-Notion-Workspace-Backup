Description: Founded in December 2017 by Kiwi tech duo Alan & Janine Grainger, Easy Crypto was built to answer the rapidly growing demand of New Zealanders wanting to swiftly, easily and safely buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP.

Within days after launching, Easy Crypto had already gained a keen and passionate customer base through word of mouth, and had instantly become New Zealand’s cheapest and easiest way to purchase Bitcoin for NZD.

With Alan endlessly upgrading the Easy Crypto website and with Janine forging strong partnerships, simplifying the compliance program and engaging with local regulators and financial services – Easy Crypto quickly grew into the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency service provider in New Zealand.
