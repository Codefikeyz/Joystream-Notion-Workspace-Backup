Description: The Coindaddy character first began as a musical project from the Reddit Bitcoin community and quickly evolved into a cryptocurrency icon. The satirical artist and musician does original music and covers of songs that bring attention to the crypto space and inform the audience about happenings in the space. Coindaddy sits at the intersection between music, crypto culture, and silicon valley tech. He is the first "crypto rapper" to move into the mainstream; creating a new genre in the process. 

He has been featured in The New York Times, Business Insider, XXL Magazine, and is honored to even have a hit piece written about him by The Daily Beast!
