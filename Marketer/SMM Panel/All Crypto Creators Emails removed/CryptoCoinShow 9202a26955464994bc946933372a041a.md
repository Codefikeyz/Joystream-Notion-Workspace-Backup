Description: We interview investors, startups, and the greatest minds in cryptocurrency and blockchain, to prepare you with the knowledge to succeed in the blockchain industry. 

We've been involved with cryptocurrency and blockchain since the dawn of Ethereum back in 2013. Shortly after, the Crypto Coin Show was born. We followed the markets closely from the DAO Hack, the initial rise of XRP and ETH to the 2017 Bitcoin Bull run and back down. With new videos released multiple times per week, be sure to SUBSCRIBE to never miss an interview:
