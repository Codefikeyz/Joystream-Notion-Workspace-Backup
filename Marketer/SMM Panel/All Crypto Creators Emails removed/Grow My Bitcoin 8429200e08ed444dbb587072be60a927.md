Description: Hi Friends, 

A warm welcome to you. Thank you for coming to visit my YT channel.

This is the YT channel for my business GMB. Https://www.growmybitcoin.co.za.

Grow My Bitcoin (Pty) Ltd is a registered business in South Africa.  I'm going to be uploading video's about my experience with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, investing and DEFI, NFT's and all things HOT in Crypto right now. 

I started out with Crypto in 2017 when a friend of mine who had left his high paying salary job to go full time into Crypto told me about Bitcoin, Ethereum and Eletroneum. He explained the BLOCKCHAIN to me and since then I have been hooked.

Stick with me where you will learn about mining, farming, ETH 2.0, the best Digital Assets to own and lots more. I plan on growing GMB into a reputable player in the Crypto Space. 

Please contact me through my website or on Telegram. https://t.me/growmybitcoin
