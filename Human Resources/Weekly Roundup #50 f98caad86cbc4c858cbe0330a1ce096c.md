# A Breakdown of Recent Happenings

The past week has been a whirlwind of activity and excitement in the Joystream community!

We’re thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of the Joystream Community Building Fund (JCBF), led by our esteemed founding member @tomato. This program is set to energize and expand our community with a range of dynamic initiatives. Expect token distributions to promising users, creative competitions, mini bounties, grants, and incentives for security and tooling contributions. Plus, we’ll be funding external communities and developers. For a deep dive into the details, check out the approved proposal [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/927).

In other news, Gleev has unveiled its highly anticipated channel categories feature, complete with a language selection option and a revamped Creator Token discovery tool. This enhancement will let viewers easily navigate their favorite content categories—be it gaming, music, tech, memes, or crypto.

We also saw significant progress with the approval of Version 4 of our project’s roadmap by the council. This new roadmap outlines exciting plans through the end of this year and into early 2025, including the much-awaited Base Bridge, a progressive web app for Gleev, video communities, premium content gating, and more. Last week’s council midterm meeting provided a thorough review of our Q2 OKRs, showcasing the impressive achievements of our DAO working group leads. You can explore the details in the forum thread [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/953).

And now for some thrilling news: our integration with the Tangem hardware wallet is complete! This state-of-the-art, card-like wallet offers top-notch security and reliability. We’re excited to offer a limited edition Joystream-branded version, complete with a 25+ year replacement warranty. With units in high demand and rapidly running out, be sure to pre-order yours at [joystream.tangem.com](https://joystream.tangem.com/).
