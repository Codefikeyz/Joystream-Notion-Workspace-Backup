# Term 19 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 19

Council: Chaos77 Jen4ph Tomato

## Summary

We made great progress in this term, building a more structured daily Standups and community updates in a dedicated channel. We’ve also included a new category into the weekly summary, “notable content creators” at the Council's request. A finesse execution of all council and proposed tasks during the term, notable to mention is the Lead scoring that will be going into the trial phase by next term and the bounty process v1 which was proposed to the council for a review. It's really going to be an interesting 20th term ahead, so much looking forward to the development of these tasks in the 4th quarter.
