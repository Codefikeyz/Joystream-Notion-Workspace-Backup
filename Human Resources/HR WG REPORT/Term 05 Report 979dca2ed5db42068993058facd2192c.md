https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/working-groups/openings/storageWorkingGroup-5

**RESIGNATION: 2**

Builders WG - 1 @mkblockchaindev

Rationale: Member confided in HR that he was scammed of a huge part of his $Joy earnings in a transaction with an unknown individual on Telegram, hence needs a fiat paying job to be able to make a living and will be leaving Joystream in search of other jobs as he could not wait for $Joy listing to pay bills and ither expenses. The worker leaving the builders WG was on his own accord and not in any way as a result of incompetence or direct eviction from the WG Lead.

Apps WG - 1 @Klaudiusz 

Rationale - Lead decided to step aside for a another candidate to lead the App WG as a result of not having enough time on his hands to serve as the App WG Lead and wouldn't want to keep a low performance record out of unavailability. He hopes to be back someday when he has enough time to serve again.
