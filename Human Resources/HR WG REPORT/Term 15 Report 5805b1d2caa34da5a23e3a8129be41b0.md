# Term 15 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 15

Council: @leet_joy @0x2bc @l1dev 

## Summary

No mid-term meeting was held this term due to the delays of the Council's and WG plans.

In this term, we had a trial meeting with the Content Worker, Omer, where we discussed the tasks of the content workers, working points, and most importantly, the great ideas that Omer shared with us. The link is here - [https://gleev.xyz/video/50262](https://gleev.xyz/video/50262) In the current term, I will try to connect with members of other teams and hold a meeting.

HR also conducted a Fireside with Council candidates, which allowed participants to share their ideas and have a chance to gain DAO votes. I should remind that Fireside with Council candidates hadn't been held since the listing, and only now we've managed to attract several candidates to this event.

At 15 terms, 3 workers were hired for the Storage Group, and another participant applied for the position of Storage Worker and is awaiting the approval of the Leader.

Two quizzes were conducted as scheduled.
