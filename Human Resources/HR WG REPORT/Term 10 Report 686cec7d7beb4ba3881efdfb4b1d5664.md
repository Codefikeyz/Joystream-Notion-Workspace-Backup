- There are several people to be rewarded in Term 10 and that will be included in the plan

## Term OKRs

These set of working group OKR’s are derived from the council’s OKRs. 

| No. | Objective | Key Results | Actions taken | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Facilitate meaningful discussions in Telegram and Discord | (1) 3-5 community members are rewarded for their recognized participation in discussions (2) At least 3 Forum threads are created to support discussion in Discord and TG | (1) HRWG monitored all the communication channels both Discord and telegram and chose members from time to time to reward for their participation in discussions and engagement. See discretionary spending section (2) Forum threads are created to facilitate discussions in Forum. This term the threads created are for suggestions. [Here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/members/3234), [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/379) and [here](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/372).
 | The 1st and 2nd key results are achieved for this term. |
| 2 | Increase Activity on Discord and Telegram | (1) HR has come up with another activity for community engagement (2) 5% increase in average daily post in general channel in discord and telegram (3) Gaps in posts in #general discord and telegram should not be longer than 4 hours | (1) Research was done but HR was not really able to come up with another activity for the community. This will be pushed to the next term (2) HR tried to be out in discord and telegram each day for the whole term and try to assist the community and newcomers. (3) HR also monitored the activities in all communication channels. | The Key results for this objective are not really achieved this term. There was even an evident decrease in the number of messages in both telegram and Discord. Perhaps this is due to the reorganization that happened in HR - all the community support specialists were fired this term. With the gap, as a lead I let it flow naturally to just monitor for this term. For next term this will be improve as we have collected some data that we can use. |
| 3 | HR Supports YPP Adoption | (1) All queries about YPP should be answered correctly and timely by HR workers | (1) HR working group workers was tasked to read and understand YPP to better support new comers. | Cannot be identified this term since there are limited questions about YPP almost nobody asked about it. |

**COUNCIL TERM 9 TASK**

These tasks are drawn from the [Council plan](https://www.notion.so/Council-Term-10-Plan-cf1225ce38be4dd78bf9ee3e2feed271?pvs=21) under the Tasks List provided by the council.

| No. | Task | Description | ETA | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Reassessment of workers’ roles and salaries | With the restructuring done in the working group, the new lead aims to reassess the current roles and tasks, positions and delegations and salaries of the working group and its workers | End of Term 10 | No salary changes were made during this term, as the new lead is still trying to understand and learn the overall operations in HR. Although, many workers are fired in the group as the new lead thought that having many workers is necessary. |
| 2 | Tutorial on Signal Proposal Writing | The purpose of this tutorial is to ensure that community members understand the basics of writing a signal proposal | End of Term 10 | This was not accomplished this term and will be pushed next term. |
| 3 | Evaluation forms | After the engagement, such as the Sunday Quiz, evaluation forms must be sent out to participants to seek suggestions and feedback for the improvement of the community engagements. | End of Term 10 | Evaluations forms for the engagement activities were sent out after the quiz sessions and feedback are collected hoping to improve our community activities.

### Extra items

- [**Handover/Retro Meeting Fixed Schedule](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/309)** was approved and is being implemented, with this proposal we look forward to have more efficient communication with the leads and the council and mainly to improve the attendance and participation from the community
- A spreadsheet for [Newcomers Daily log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oikCJAiTFZwklc9bmJ3VJoA6NdxGuHfZU39c5MhHQlk/edit#gid=794807300) is produced as well to help us have an idea who are the people joining discord and with this, we are hoping to have a more efficient onboarding of newcomers based on their interest and activity in Discord. This will also help to determine whether we are achieving our goals or not.
- As one of the main functions of Human Resource Working group is to recruit people, we’ve try another approach. Job postings on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jenny-saludes-chizh-3b7747119_work-hiring-web3-activity-7064492222859153408-KBWP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)  and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Joystreamph-110022274884492) (page’s name is still yet to be updated) are publish and it seems like it is a bit efficient. HR will continue efforts in this direction to bring more talents and exposure to Joystream. Discord job sites will also be explored later on.
