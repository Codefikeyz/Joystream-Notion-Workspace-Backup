# Term 11 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 11

Council: @leet_joy @l1dev @Codefikeyz 

May 18, 2023 → June 1, 2023

## Summary

This term, HR operations went smoothly almost all the tasks and OKRs are accomplished. However one of the priorities are not completed this term - that is about the Lead Scoring System which is still in progress.

This number joined Discord and X for telegram.

With regard to council election, we facilitated that as well. Timely announcements are done and we’re able to interview one candidate since he applied early and we conducted an interesting session with 5 of the candidates called - Fireside Chat. Recently we came up with a rule for the potential participants for this.

With community engagement, we successfully shipped the workshop called - Pioneer Tour, we are aiming to improve the number of participants for our engagements. Also we did 2 rounds Sunday Quiz. HR also tries to recognize community member for their participation in the discussions and being involved in the day to day operations of the DAO

With recruitment, we are able to assist working in joining working group. Also we have our efforts outside Joystream with regard to job postings - which turned out to be good since we are able to attract writers, couple of designers and developers.
