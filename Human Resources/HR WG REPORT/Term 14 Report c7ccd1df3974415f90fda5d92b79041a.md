# Term 14 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 14

Council: @leet_joy @0x2bc @l1dev 

## Summary

Two discussion threads were created on the forum: 

- [Rewards For Participating In The Sunday Quiz](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/472)
- [**Leads Scoring And Effects On Salary](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/474)** then the discussion was then moved to [the previous thread](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/427) (2 ****metrics can be used in the work, only the part with the OKR remains. In any case, I kindly request that you review my pre-proposals so that I can improve them if necessary).

HR has started to publish daily news, now we will do this at the same time every day at 10 CET time. I think this may create a habit of people expecting news and develop a habit of them reading it. This is a small experiment.

One worker fired: Vladiccck has been terminated 04.07.2023. Currently, the HR WG consists of 4 workers, including the HR Lead.

The HR team is continuing to collect data regarding the daily influx of newcomers and highlighting those who are particularly active with the goal of inviting them to participate in the quiz and other activities.

Unfortunately, no fireside chat was held with the candidates for the Council in this term. None of the candidates confirmed their participation.
