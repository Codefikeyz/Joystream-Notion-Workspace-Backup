# Term 12 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 12

Council: @leet_joy @l1dev @0x2bc 

## Summary

Term 12 was quite full of activities and engagements for HR and also for the DAO. HR working group has organized/assisted at least 5 activities: 2 Sunday quizzes, 1 workshop, and 2-3 calls relating to elections and governance meetings. It was not easy for the group since the team was not used to doing this before. We also tried to provide documentation of all the said activities from written to audio and video recording.

In terms of community management, we also had a massive number of newcomers who came to Discord and Telegram - HR tried to welcome and give support to them in a timely manner and moderate the channels by removing unnecessary messages on some channels on Discord and TG as well. In the beginning of the term, the population of Discord is at 5,378 and by the end we are at ~15,500, or 187% increase. On the DAO side, currently, we have 60 people from council members to working group workers. There were 2 additional workers in the DAO

On the recruitment side, we’ve done job posting both internally by posting the vacancies from time to time and externally as well on different platforms.
