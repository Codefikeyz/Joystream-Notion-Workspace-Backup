# Term 17 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 17

Council: @l1dev @Jen4ph @swasilenko 

## Summary

I have hired one worker for the position of DAO Coordinator in this term. While he is getting trained and performing various tasks of the HR group to get a better understanding of the job tasks, in the 18th term I will assign him specific tasks and list them [here](../Archive/HR%20tasks,%20new%20one%200cb7e9d6540f4be0925f62063d28bcdd.md).  

We are continuing to work on compiling the [Weekly Summary](https://blog.joystream.org/). For this task, I have added two HR workers and created a [guide](../Guide%20on%20How%20to%20Fill%20Out%20Data%20for%20a%20Weekly%20Roundup%205718f8b103bf4cefb67a3ba122717a5a.md) for gathering data for the report. The guys did an excellent job with the assignment. @0x2bc is still helping us with the technical aspects of the report.

The HR department continued to work on the research in this term.

In this term, **dmtrmltsv** also requested HR's help to support the YPP users on YPP -support in the  Discord. Therefore, HR was made aware of the new task and the necessary materials to answer users' questions accurately. We are continuing to work on this task in the coming term.

HR continues to gather [FAQ](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/511) from experienced specialists in order to improve community support and provide quick and quality responses.
