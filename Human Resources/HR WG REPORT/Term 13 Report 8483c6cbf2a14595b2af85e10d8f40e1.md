# Term 13 Report

HR Working Group Report for Term 13

Council: @leet_joy @0x2bc @VN CHAIN 

## Summary

The 13th term became the most difficult period for HR work. Before the listing, there was a large influx of newcomers, I received more than three requests to apply to the Storage and Distribution Group. After the listing, the situation changed drastically. As a result, the group faced sudden changes: we got lots of hate on Discord and Telegram channels, and people who wanted to apply for positions eventually refused. Also, the absence of the group leader had an impact on the group's work.

The number of participants in the quiz decreased by 2.6 times compared to the previous quiz.
 

The fireside chat was canceled, with none of the Council confirming their attendance.

In any case, HR continues to support activity and carry out all events regardless of the number of participants.
