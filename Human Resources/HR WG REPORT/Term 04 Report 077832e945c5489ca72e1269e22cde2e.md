**2. Total hires made this term:** 0

**3. Total fires made this term:** 2 (Crptowolf and MayorTee)

**4. Reason for firing:** Both workers failed to deliver on task given in a space of 1 week. This was to create a working plan as a community manager and daily activities to be carried out in the DAO. While having salaries unslashed and a heads up given, to deliver task, an additional 48 hours grace period was given for workers to deliver on the job, but to no avail, thus I had to let them go. A new opening was created with a plan as mandatory to application just for 1 position of a Community Manager.

**4. Current Openings = 2**
