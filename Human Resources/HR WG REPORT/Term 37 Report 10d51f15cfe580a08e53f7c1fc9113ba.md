**NOTE:***  In Term 38, I plan to introduce a modest raise for our HR workers (community managers) to boost morale and motivation during these challenging times. With the recent increase in community support responsibilities and a potential surge in content production from our new content manager—particularly across external platforms like Twitter—their workload and strategic role will expand significantly. Taking into account the EMA30 cap, this raise is structured to fairly reward their contributions while maintaining financial sustainability.
