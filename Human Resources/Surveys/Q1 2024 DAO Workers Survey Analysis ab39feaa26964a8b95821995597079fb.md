A feedback from a worker in builders working group notes that while the current situation isn't dire, the member feels disconnected from the mid-to-long-term priorities of the BWG due to a focus on immediate tasks. They suggest that regular BWG calls could help address this issue, recognizing their own potential lack of involvement in recent DAO calls as a contributing factor. Overall, the response shows self-awareness and a proactive approach to improving communication and alignment within the DAO.

Summary: Workers have varied opinions regarding the competitiveness of their compensation compared to similar roles in the industry and region. Concerns include financial risks due to fluctuating token prices affecting server expenses, unbalanced salary structures favoring council members, operating servers at a loss impacting competitiveness, and challenges in meeting expenses due to falling token prices. Some workers acknowledge non-monetary incentives and enjoyment in contributing to Joystream's success, while others compare their salaries to industry standards and express dissatisfaction with the current payment system's instability and lack of fixed policies.

Recommendation: Implement measures to mitigate financial risks associated with fluctuating token prices, ensuring stability in workers' income; reviewing and adjusting salary structures to fairly reflect performance, time and commitment amongst all workers, including council and also ensuring a fair amount of competitiveness of compensation with industry standards and regional salary levels by considering relevant factors, e.g required skills, server cost etc.
