Discretionary payments made from WG budget are not all represented in the WG payment TXN link above. Either the payments have not been made or the transaction is somewhat complex for me to locate. But the lead can help provide more details into this.

All WG transactions are accounted for with rationale.

### Recommendation:

Leads should make payment details as clear as possible that a non DAO worker can be able to read and relate with group plans, report and payment transactions. Although this might seem somewhat tedious for example the MWGL, who makes lengthy payments to ambassadors on possibly multiple occasions. It would still be really nice to see and associate transactions/rationale with stated payments in WG reports for transparency and accountability.
