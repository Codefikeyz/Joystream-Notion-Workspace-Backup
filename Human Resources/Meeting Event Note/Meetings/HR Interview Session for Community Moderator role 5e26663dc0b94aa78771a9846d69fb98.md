### Interview Note with Umar_Chike

**1. Addressing DAO Activity and Security Concerns:**

*Question:* Posts in the community are visible round the clock, how do you intend to moderate them when your availabilty is for a specific time period only? 

*Answer:* Certainly, this is a critical consideration. While acknowledging the challenge, I am committed to actively monitoring channels and promptly addressing any issues during the 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. CET window. My goal is to proactively resolve any potential threats before the majority of DAO members become active around 9 a.m. CET.

- I've observed that DAO members are generally active from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. CET, with less activity during the night. By waking up at 4 a.m. CET, I can efficiently clear spam from channels before others come online, ensuring a proactive approach to address any security concerns.

**2. Overview of Working Experience:**

*Question:* Say anything about your working experience.

*Answer:* I joined Joystream in 2022, initially working in HR for over 4 months, where my responsibilities included recruiting and guiding individuals to join the DAO. Subsequently, I transitioned to the builders working group for 3 months and later moved to a marketing role, where I have been actively contributing since October of the previous year.

**3. Familiarity with Support Channels and Frequently Asked Questions:**

*Question:* Are you conversant with the support channel and any other channel and the most frequently asked questions in the Joystream server?

*Answer:* While my primary focus is on recruiting new creators and members outside Joystream, I actively engage with common inquiries in the support channel. Frequently encountered questions include concerns about sign-ups, delayed applications, issues with channel styles, and discrepancies in withdrawal reflecting in wallets. I consistently address these common support questions to ensure a seamless experience for our community members.

**4. Approach to Community Support and Communication:**

*Question:* How do you plan to enhance community support and communication within Joystream?

*Answer:* Building on my experience and understanding of common support issues, I plan to institute a more robust communication strategy. This involves regularly updating the community about potential challenges and addressing common concerns through proactive communication channels. Additionally, I aim to organize periodic Q&A sessions to address queries directly, fostering a more transparent and engaged community.

### Interview Note with Marikjudo

1. **Question: Share your experiences.**
    - **Answer:** In 2021, I joined Joystream and actively participated in various projects, such as the testnet, contributing to incentivize Joystream. My contributions include handling applications for community job positions, creating a promotional video for Atlas, and managing social tasks with KPI. While part of the marketing working group, I observed leadership changes. Despite a brief period of reduced involvement, I have returned, captivated by the project's developments, leading to my application for a position where I aspire to make a significant contribution.
2. **Question: What would you do differently in HR as a community moderator?**
    - **Answer:** While I haven't directly worked in HR at Joystream, during the testnet phase, I actively assisted in onboarding new members. I briefly held a moderator position in another project, potentially Clay Stack, before its decline. While my direct HR experience is limited, I have a clear understanding of the role's responsibilities. Regular observation and analysis of HR group documents and activities provide me with insights into the position's requirements.
3. **Your Availability**
    - **Answer:** Available from 1 p.m. CET until 8 p.m. CET.
4. **Question: How familiar are you with HR tasks in the Joystream community?**
    - **Answer:** I understand the scope of HR work, encompassing onboarding, bounty management, meetings, community engagement, and information collection. I find these tasks intriguing and am eager to contribute to them.
5. **Question: How can you increase involvement in the Joystream project?**
    - **Answer:** We aim to generate more interest in Joystream, leveraging innovative ideas and the collaborative efforts of marketing other teams. I believe HR plays a crucial role in creating rules and fostering teamwork to ensure smooth operations.
6. **Question: Have you seen HR codes of conduct posted recently as guidelines for HR workers?**
    - **Answer:** I haven't come across them yet but will read about them after the call.
7. **Question: Do you follow HR daily updates in the channel?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, I follow and actively participate in stand-up meetings.
8. **Question: What do HR's main tasks mean to you?**
    - **Answer:** For me, HR tasks include onboarding to welcome and involve new members, facilitating communication among community members and working groups, providing support for questions and difficulties through dedicated channels, and managing data through logging processes.
9. **Question: Any questions about the reward for the position? (1000 joy for a week and 4000 joy a month)**
    - **Answer:** No, it is clear for me.
10. **Question: How can you be trusted for the HR role, given the moderator rights you would be granted?**
    - **Answer:** You should trust me because I have been a dedicated member of the Joystream project and have not violated any rules before.
11. **Question: What can you say about the recent incident where a member abused Joystream roles?**
    - **Answer:** While we should not tolerate such situations, personal conflicts between DAO members are inevitable. This specific issue arose from a personal relationship, and I believe it could have been resolved earlier. Our community displays great patience, and in such situations, we need to assess each other's behavior. While accidents cannot be entirely prevented, our strong community and well-established rules make them less critical overall.

### Interview Note with **Counsellor:**

1. **Question:** What is your time zone for the job?
    - **Answer:** 9pm to 6am CET
2. **Question:** The time you indicated corresponds to your sleeping hours. How do you plan to stay awake for the job during that time?
    - **Answer:** I will definitely be awake. I barely sleep, so it won't be a problem for me.
3. **Question:** Tell us about your experience in Joystream.
    - **Answer:** I joined JoyStream in 2022, working in HR as an integrator responsible for registering new members. This role provided insights into the job's challenges and the need for support and guidance. I also participated in other groups, including builders and marketing. Notably, during the 2023 testnets, I collaborated on a handbook upgrade with Ismail and worked on the main net in builders from March to May 2023.
4. **Question:** Based on your previous experience in HR WG, what changes can you bring to the role?
    - **Answer:** It's not rocket science; it just requires more hard work. I've heard about the incident with the new worker deleting messages unexpectedly. You have diligent workers, though there might be room for improvement with additional skilled workers. For now, HR is doing fine.
5. **Question:** In which aspects could this work be done better?
    - **Answer:** I've noticed new members being confused, with delayed responses. Tomato, who I believe is not in the working group, sometimes provides responses.
6. **Question:** What are your thoughts about the recent incident you were talking about, regarding deleting messages?
    - **Answer:** I didn't grasp all the details, but I witnessed people mentioning that someone deleted a message. There was another complicated situation involving owing. I'm not well-versed in the whole matter, but deleting messages just because you have the power seems like an abuse of power and shouldn't happen.
7. **Question:** In regards to the tasks listed, can you please explain briefly and how you can achieve them?
    - **Answer:** During my time in HR in TestNet, onboarding was a primary focus, helping those unfamiliar with DAO and tasks like creating a Polkadot extension account. I'm well-versed in moderating and community work, utilizing tools for tasks like deleting spam. Communication, both basic and ensuring understanding, is another area of expertise. Support involves guiding users and clarifying potential honest mistakes in spam. However, data logging remains unclear to me.
8. **Question:** What do you think we should expect from you as the community moderator?
    - **Answer:** I excelled in Testnet, leading to my promotion as an integrator. While I can't predict the future, my dedication and past performance speak for themselves. I won't make promises, but judge me based on my track record. I'll be available from 9 pm to 6 am without any issues.
