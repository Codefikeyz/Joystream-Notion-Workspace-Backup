### **Questions and Answers:**

### 1. **Tell us about yourself and why you want to run fro council?**

**Mayortee:**

- I've been actively involved with Joystream for over a year and have contributed to the HR working group and the DAO. My focus is on promoting developer growth and ensuring successful roadmap execution.

**Songoku:**

- My goal is to support the implementation of the recently approved roadmap. I also want to address community concerns and potentially organize a video production contest to end the year on a positive note.

### **Manifesto Highlights**

**Mayortee:**

- In my manifesto, I emphasize promoting developer growth, executing the roadmap, and enhancing the value of the Joystream network through new features.

**Chaos:**

- My manifesto includes working on tools for DAO finance planning, completing the validator page, ensuring a smooth runtime upgrade, and finalizing tools for project planning.

**Songoku:**

- It focuses on supporting roadmap implementation, addressing community concerns, and proposing a year-ending video production contest.

### 2. **What do you think is the most pressing issue in the DAO and how you have contributed to this issue so far?**

**Mayortee:**

- The unresolved issue of the DAO worker's salary is significant. I've shared my opinions on the matter and have proposed a solution in my manifesto.

**Chaos:**

- I cannot pinpoint a single issue, but improvements are needed in various areas, including market cap, tokenomics, and product enhancements. I've been actively involved in discussions about working group salaries.

**Songoku:**

- The apps Working Group is a crucial area, and I've proposed a solution by suggesting a temporary lead to address documentation issues and organize the group.

### 3. **What is your vision for Apps Working Group?**

**Mayortee:**

- My vision is to get a new lead for the apps Working group, ensuring proper management and functionality. It's a critical group for the DAO.

**Chaos:**

- The apps Working group should manage external services and contribute to the technical aspects of new gateways. Additionally, it should handle financial responsibilities.

**Songoku:**

- My vision is to find a new lead for the apps Working group, potentially from within the DAO, to address documentation issues and contribute technically.

### 4. **Do you think there is a challenge that hinders our overall progress as a DAO?**

**Mayortee:**

- There is a need for transparent decision-making processes and clear communication to build trust among community members and potential investors.

**Chaos:**

- Decision-making speed and financial constraints are challenges. Some level of centralization may be necessary for quicker progress, and we need better control over the DAO's finances.

**Songoku:**

- Lack of participation from new members is a challenge. Attracting fresh members and ensuring effecient community engagement can help overcome this hurdle.
