# Report on DAOs Holiday Policy Research

### Introduction:

During the course of this research, an extensive examination was conducted on various Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to understand their approaches to holiday policies and governance structures. While the aim was to gather comprehensive data, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges encountered during this process. Many DAOs either lacked organized information accessible for analysis, failed to respond to inquiries regarding governance and working group processes, or presented barriers to access, such as requirements for wallet connections, token possession, or bot verification to community—steps which were not pursued due to security considerations. Despite these obstacles, the insights garnered from the examined DAOs shed light on the diverse strategies employed within decentralized ecosystems and provide valuable perspectives for understanding the evolving landscape of decentralized governance and workforce management

### Findings:

Bankless DAO's approach to holiday policies seems quite innovative and tailored to the decentralized nature of their organization. They've structured their operations around funding cycles termed "Seasons," each lasting 16 weeks. This setup allows contributors to align their efforts and energy collectively.

The inclusion of designated "Gap Weeks" and an "Annual Break" between seasons demonstrates a thoughtful consideration for the need for contributors to rest and recharge. This approach reflects an understanding of the importance of work-life balance, even within a DAO.

One interesting aspect is that teams within the DAO have the autonomy to decide which activities should continue through breaks, providing flexibility based on their specific needs and ongoing projects. This decentralized decision-making empowers teams to manage their schedules and resources effectively.

The request for comment (RFC) post indicates an open and transparent approach to policy development within Bankless DAO. Seeking feedback from members ensures that holiday policies are responsive to the needs and preferences of the community. This participatory approach fosters a sense of ownership and engagement among contributors, which is crucial in a decentralized setting.

MakerDAO's holiday policy is notably different from traditional corporate structures and even some other DAOs. MakerDAO does not offer formal holiday time or leave for its contributors, with the only exception mentioned being December, during which there is no governance cycle.

This approach indicates a focus on maintaining continuous operations and productivity throughout the year. By not providing designated holiday time, MakerDAO may prioritize the ongoing governance and decision-making processes essential for its decentralized platform.

However, the absence of formal holiday policies may raise questions about contributors' well-being and work-life balance. Without designated time off, contributors may face challenges in managing their workload and taking necessary breaks to prevent burnout.

It's essential to consider the implications of MakerDAO's policy on contributors' satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational culture. While prioritizing productivity is crucial, fostering a supportive and sustainable work environment is also essential for long-term success.

### Conclusion:

This research has provided valuable insight into the holiday policies and governance structures of some DAOs. Throughout the exploration, it became evident that while many DAOs face challenges in terms of organization, accessibility, and transparency, Joystream DAO stands out for its unique features. Joystream DAO distinguishes itself as a more structured, accessible, transparent, and truly decentralized entity compared to other DAOs explored in this study.

The transparency of Joystream DAO's operations, coupled with its decentralized governance model, has empowered contributors to actively participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the overall dvelopment of the Joystream project. This level of transparency and decentralization sets Joystream DAO apart, fostering a culture of openness, collaboration, and innovation within the decentralized ecosystem.

As I explored the practices of other DAOs, it became clear that establishing a structured holiday policy is essential for promoting the well-being and productivity of contributors within Joystream DAO. While other DAOs may face limitations or complexities in their policies, Joystream DAO has the advantage of collecting community feedback to initiate a policy regulating the DAO contributors that is tailored to our needs and values.

### Recommendation:

Moving forward, it's crucial for the council to take proactive steps in establishing a holiday policy that aligns with our shared values and objectives. This initiative will not only reflect Joystream DAO's commitment to the welfare and empowerment of our contributors but also position us as a trailblazer among decentralized organizations. I've already [provided feedback on this matter](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/898?post=6519), along with others, and with a bit of fine-tuning, it can serve as a valuable resource in shaping our policy moving forward.
