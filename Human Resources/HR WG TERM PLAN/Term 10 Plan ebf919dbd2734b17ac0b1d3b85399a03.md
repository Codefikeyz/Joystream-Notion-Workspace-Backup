Firing and Hiring

The new lead has plans on firing quite a number workers and this is yet to be finalized. This section will be updated and the council will be notified once the assessment is done.

Hiring *might (but unlikely for this term)* also happen to suffice the specific needs of the wg’s operation (Such as hiring another support from SEA region and/or Western countries to provide support based on the working hours needed). This is due to the fact that all workers of HR WG are from Nigeria and Russia so there might be a need for diversification and there is this period of the day that has the lowest activities seen from the workers.

### 2. **Planned Budget for the Term:**

**Planned Budget**: — will be updated once HR is done with the preliminary assessment of the WG
Rationale: TBA

Extra Budget: TBD

Payment for the Sunday Quiz Winners held on April 30 = 3500 Joy

Freakstatic = 2000 Joy

Kalpakci = 1000 Joy

### 4. Others

The council has hired a new HR lead for this term, and aside from the priorities written above, below are some items HR needs to accomplish this term

- HR handover meeting with all the workers, and this plan is subject to changes after this meeting depending on the assessment of the overall operations in the group
- Improving task distribution and deleggation to the workers to fulfill the responsibilities of HR in the DAO
- Start to build Joystream DAO accounts on job sites such as LinkedIn and other similar sites, it would be good to start building the profile of Joystream DAO outside for future hirings and for the exposure of the project as well
