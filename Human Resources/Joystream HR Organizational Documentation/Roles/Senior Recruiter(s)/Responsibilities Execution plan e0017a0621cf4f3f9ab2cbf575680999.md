**THE ROLE OF SENIOR RECRUITER FOR JOYSREAM DAO**

Recruitment during testnet was mainly based on demand as working group leads had make request before the recruitment procedure begins, however, now that we are in mainnet , w=recruitment  would evolve to accommodate the changes in the DAO’s daily operational needs. We this in mind, I’m going to be implementing the following recruitment strategies.

- Employee referrals

This will be direct referrals from already performing working group members and other participants, you never know where you’ll find a hidden gem

- Social media recruiting

i’m going to be using social media platforms like facebook, twitter, linkedin, telegram and discord to scout for talents. By leveraging the power of social media, we can improve their brand recognition, reach a wider range of talent, and create a more efficient and effective recruitment process.

- Diversity and inclusion initiative

Diversity and inclusion initiatives are programs, policies, and practices aimed at creating a workplace culture that values and embraces diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, and ability. The goal of these initiatives is to create a workplace where all employees feel valued and supported, and where everyone has equal opportunities for growth and success. By promoting diversity and inclusion, joystream can improve it’s reputation, attract a wider range of talent, and benefit from the different perspectives and experiences that a diverse workforce brings.

- Experience optimization

Candidate experience optimization refers to the process of improving the overall experience of job applicants throughout the recruitment process. This includes everything from the initial job posting, to the application process, to the interview, to the final decision. The goal of candidate experience optimization is to make the process as smooth, efficient, and positive as possible for the candidate, while also ensuring that the company finds the right person for the job. This can involve things like streamlining the application process, providing timely and clear communication, offering fair and respectful interviews, and providing prompt and helpful feedback. By optimizing the candidate experience, joystream can improve it’s reputation as an employer, attract more top talent, and reduce turnover.

- Employee value proposition enhancement

Employee Value Proposition (EVP) enhancement is a strategy to improve the benefits and perks offered to employees in order to attract and retain top talent. This can include things like competitive salaries, flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, a positive company culture, and work-life balance initiatives. By improving our EVP, joystream can differentiate itself from competitors and make itself a more attractive place to work, which can help it to attract and retain top talent.

It is imperative that we take advantage of our human resources so while we are looking out for talents, we should also be looking inside for the rough diamonds we never notices so we’ll be revolving our bounty programs with the members of the community and analysing output to determine who deserves to be in what working group. We will also be implementing a few policies to ensure that our talents to leave in search for better offers below are some retention policies I intend to implement.

- Competitive salary and benefits packages

This would be based on performance, working group leads should be keeping a record of their workers performance records, this should include efficiencies and time management

- Opportunities for growth and development

Sometime prospective employees can be enthusiastic and motivated about a position without experience in that particular role, a one off bounty or trial period should come in handy in trying such an individual in that role to see if such an individual can deliver on that role

- Recognition and rewards for good performance deserve reward this would serve as a positive reinforcement to both the worker and others to step up

Good

- Work-life balance initiatives
- Clear communication and regular feedback
- Employee engagement programs

Introducing programs different from the usual role roles employees perform, to foster team spirit and versatility.

- Employee wellness programs
- Flexible work arrangements
- Opportunities for skill building and cross-training.

Drawing a reference from what the content curation working group did during testnet when they employed temporary workers weekly to introduce them to content curating, this should be extended to other working groups
