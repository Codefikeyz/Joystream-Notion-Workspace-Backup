- Prepare a well documented report of the recent happenings in Joystream in the past week
- This report is prepared with the help of the report.joyutils.org
- It is published every tuesday after a review by the council and marketing lead, blog.joystream.org
- Report includes a lot of interesting data, from weekly sign ups to video content, tokenomics, product releases, past and upcoming events, rockstar of the week, notable content creators etc

**Update**

- A little issue with generating report for some weeks now
- BWGL has been personally generating and sending report data
- BWG to work on implementing stats form CRT feature.
