- This was done for the community support team via a live screen sharing session on discord
- The team got to try out the whole CRT feature including creation, editing token, market sale, revenue share etc
- The [CRT outline](https://www.notion.so/Creator-Tokens-afb46f9b7f7444979114fc768eddd820?pvs=21) was used for this training and also continually used for community support
