### **IDEAS**

1. **Welcome and Introduction:**
    - **Intro Message:** Brief overview of Joystream, its mission, and the value of the Discord community.
    - **Welcome Bot:** Automated messages to guide new users through the server, explaining the main channels and setting the community tone.
2. **Segmented Onboarding Questions:**
    - **Initial Questionnaire:** Tailored questions to categorize new members into creators, token holders, potential token holders, and general enthusiasts.
        - Example Questions:
            - Why are you joining the Joystream Discord? (Options: Creator, token holder, Potential token holder, Enthusiast)
            - What are your main interests? (Options: Content, Development, Community, Infrastructure, Marketing, Governance, Investment)
3. **Perks and Engagement:**
    - **Highlight Perks:** Communicate benefits of active participation in the Discord community.
        - **For Creators:** Promotion, community building, collaboration opportunities.
        - **For token holders:** Updates, direct communication with the team, community insights. (token holders/potential token holders can be asked if they would like to subscribe to our newsletter on Joystream website and also notified of our weekly report, tagged on discord and we can also offer the choice of sending link via mail once we have the roundup published). **Do we create a dedicated channel visible to token holders only?**
        - **For Enthusiasts:** Networking, learning, community engagement.
    - **Creator Community:** Dedicated space for creators to share and promote content, categorized by interest. **Add:** Tips & Suggestions channel
        - **Engagement Activities:** Regular weekly events, such as quizzes and other programs to keep the community engaged. We can bring back the weekly HR quiz which questions can be contributed from both mwg and cwg to keep the community educated and mostly informed about recent happenings in Joystream. The program can be bi-weekly to build anticipation and enthusiasm
4. **Streamlined Role Assignment:**
    - **Simplified Roles:** Reduce the number of roles and ensure clarity.
        - **Core Roles:** Admin, FMs, Council, DAO, JSG, Leads, Dep. Workers. Creators, token holder. Ambassador.
        - **Sub-Roles:** Aspiring Earners, Aspiring Creators, Enthusiast.
    - **Color-Coding:** Consistent colour-coding for core roles to maintain clarity and reduce confusion, default colour (white) for other roles.
    - **Verification Process:** Maintain current process for verifying new members.
5. **Security Measures:**
    - **Anti-Scam Measures:** Filter malicious keywords and usernames to prevent scams
    - **Manual Verification & Limited posting/channel access:** Some core roles are to be assigned manually (creators and ambassadors) not sure if we can do this for token holders as well. Then a limit on accessible channels should be placed on sub roles, as well as a 24hr limit to posting in these channels.
6. **Community Growth and Marketing:**
    - **Community Spotlights:** Feature active and valuable members (excluding Leads & CMs) creators & content in weekly roundup report as rockstar of the week, rewarding them with $50 worth of JOY. (This can be vested under lower timeframe or not). The reward would boost creative and invaluable contributions.
    - **Partnership Opportunities:** Collaborate with creators and influencers for cross-promotion and content creation. Creators are encouraged to collab with other creators with their unique audience and spread the more words about Joystream. This can be in form of AMAs or weekly roundup summary. MWG can make this an open challenge and we can figure out how to run it up.
7. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - **Feedback Loop:** Regularly gather feedback from the community through a dedicated channel.
    - **Surveys and Polls:** Conduct periodic surveys to gauge member satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

---

**Conclusion:** By focusing on clear objectives, streamlined processes, and active engagement, the Joystream Discord onboarding process can effectively attract and retain valuable members while minimizing the risk of scams. This comprehensive approach ensures that Discord remains a vibrant, safe, and productive space for all community members.
