We have a dedicated channel there just for discussion about bridges as well as several other interesting channels.

Ans: You can track JOY price value here [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/joystream/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/joystream/)

However, we do not encourage price/market discussions, there is an unofficial discord channel where you sre free to do this. You can join here - [https://discord.com/invite/xvAAf4GK](https://discord.com/invite/xvAAf4GK)

1. How does Joystream plan to generate income for sustainability amidst the existing rewards and outflow systems?

ANS: check the token page for example: [http://www.joystream.org/token](http://www.joystream.org/token)

1. What are your thoughts on the allocation of approximately 52% of tokens vested for 24 months for founding members and an additional 32% for investors? Does this allocation raise concerns about the potential for a market dump?

ANS: The founding members constitute the community rather than the "core team." For further information, please refer to: [https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program](https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program)

1. When do the vesting periods for the allocated tokens to founding members and investors begin, and is the vesting structure linear?

ANS: Vesting started December 9th 2022 when mainnet went live, so there at this point some 80% of total supply is circulating. You can read more here [https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program](https://handbook.joystream.org/founding-member-program)

1. Could you clarify the rationale behind the higher allocation? Is it designated for DAO governance rewards, other incentives, or are rewards distributed through reserves?

ANS: None of the rewards paid out are paid via reserves. On our DAO the elected council vote on proposals which allocate resources to our working groups (we have 9 of them, including builders, storage + distribution as well as marketing and some others).
These are newly minted tokens.

1. Are there plans to generate revenue through advertising or premium account subscriptions targeted at viewers?

ANS: That belongs at application layer, not the protocol layer, but there are plans to add protocol revenue from apps, regardless of how each individual app chooses to monetize
