# Discord Onboarding Flow

The current onboarding flow for Joystream's Discord server faces significant challenges: limited creator engagement, ineffective role assignment, vulnerabilities to malicious attacks across multiple channels, and a lack of clear member segmentation. Currently, Discord is primarily utilized by creators for support rather than community growth, with an abundance of roles allowing scammers to exploit legitimacy.

The goal is to transform Discord into a vibrant platform where creators can actively promote themselves and build their audience, token holders can stay informed and engage, potential token holders can be inspired by community activities, enthusiasts learn, network and explore exciting opportunities in Joystream. The new onboarding flow aims to streamline role assignment, enhance security measures against scams, and cultivate a well-coordinated and supportive community environment.

### 1. **Welcome and Introduction**

- **Intro Message:**
    - Welcome to Joystream! We’re thrilled to have you here. Joystream is a decentralized video platform and community governed by its users.

### 2. Add Server Rules in Onboarding Flow
