# NYM discord server

A research into NYM’s server.

1/n.

The first action was to click on the invite link - https://discord.gg/nym

This opens the page below

2/n.

Page 1/3 of the onboarding process request that you choose purpose of joining the server and channels you'd like to see. I chose I want to see everything and proceeded to click Next.

3/n. 

The 2nd page requested I choose the type of notifications I would like to receive. I chose all except new nodes for staking

4/n.

Page 3/3 asks that “I pick a language or a region”

I couldn't see English as a language, so I chose the closest thing to it, which is my region, Nigeria.

No idea if Nigeria was shown because my IP address was detected or something, it might probably be the case because a whole lot of other countries in Africa and beyond that speaks english could have been displayed, but my Fatherland was displayed.

5/n.

Next page brought me to the rules section.

I read the rules, “the agree and finish” button was not highlighted until I got to the end of the page.

6/n.

After clicking on Agree and Finish, this landed me in their rules channel (I guess we can call this their landing channel)

Below is a complete list of the channels in the server

Observation: the onboarding process was easy and seamless, no verification bot or process whatsoever. But it is not clear what access or permission was enabled in the Server settings, for example if had access to the server because I have my phone number verified on discord, or maybe because I am an old discord user. No time in delay to send messages after joining server was noticed. Overall, it was a good onboarding experience.
