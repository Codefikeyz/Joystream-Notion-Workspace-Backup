- Verification is quite lengthy. At verification stage I have access to only one channel - start here.

Once I am verified, I have access to all channels.

In the Welkom channel, there is no separate channel for greeting new members. The Start Here channel provides the rules and official links.

### Yearn Talk

When I logged onto the server, a dashboard with possible actions appeared

I switched to the general channel. Almost all channels are available for viewing, but in order to start communicating I need to go through authorization.

For authorization, you need to familiarize yourself with the server's rules

After going over the rules, I am now able to access all communication channels

There are only four categories on the Welcome Channel:

1. announcements 
2. rules
3. links
4. tweets
