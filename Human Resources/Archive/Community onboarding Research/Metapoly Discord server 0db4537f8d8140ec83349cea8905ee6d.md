5/n.

The next page brought my to a #follow-d33dgens channel, not sure what to do obviously to follow an account. I exited the channel as I already had access to #general chat channel

6/n.

Above is a list of all the channels in the server.

Observation, the onboarding was not a bad one, with a few clicks before having access to the server channels.
