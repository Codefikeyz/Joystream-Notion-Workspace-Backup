# Joystream Discord proposal

To understand how to improve the verification process, I conducted a research study into server verification on Joystream.

1. Captcha verification

In order to get access to the Joystream Discord server, I needed a link to an invitation. I was unable to join the server by searching for it. Currently, the only verification required is checking off that I am human and selecting images with the wardrobe. After this simple process, I was immediately able to access the server and all channels were available for interaction.

# Proposal with a list of channels that would be seen by Joystream newcomers and solution to the Discord Captcha bot

1. Captcha verification, confirming that the user is human,  (see image above). 
2. I also liked the step-by-step verification process which allows me to choose where to go next.

Why do I suggest step-by-step verification? Firstly, it is convenient for a newcomers who will be familiarized with server rules and join the channel they are interested in. Secondly, it is an additional obstacle for bots:

### Step 1: Accept the server rules (tick the box indicating that you have read and agree to the server rules)  [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812339119295692820](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812339119295692820)

### (1) Step 2: Where to go:

- I want to get started right away (links or general channel)
- I have some questions, direct me to the HR  (start here channel)
- I am a content creator (content creator channel)
- I am currently looking around here (just browsing some channels, without the ability to communicate; to start engaging, additional verification is required).

### (2) Step 2: Where to go:

- I want to have a chat (general)
- What's the news? [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812339211701190747](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812339211701190747)
- I have some questions, direct me to the HR  (start here channel)
- I am a content creator (content creator channel)
- Also, if we want to do an additional verification, I like this option:

*It is necessary to improve the chapter on Rules. It currently looks very unprofessional and doesn't draw attention. I liked NYM's solution:

### Getting started

I haven't encountered so many channels dedicated to newcomers in any other server like we have in Joystream. In some servers, such channels are not even provided. Therefore, I suggest the following solution:

Getting started:

- links
- rukes
- start-here
- scam-awareness

I suggest deleting the 'Welcome' and 'Introduce Yourself' channels. There has been no activity there for a long time and, what's more, I think it confuses newcomers when there are so many channels.
