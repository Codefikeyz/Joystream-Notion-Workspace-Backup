|  | Did you like the format of the event? | What did you like the most? | What didn't you like? | Do you have any suggestions or remarks that the HR team should consider for the next similar event? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **leet_joy** | **Yes** | **Questions/Answers** | Participants sometimes took too much time to answer. Rules should be strict, if the person cannot answer in 1-2 sentences - mute him.
The permission to record audio was not requested but the session was recorded. | **If the person does not follow the rules disqualify him from the next 3 questions.** |
| **vikan** | I like the format | It lasted long enough | Very few audience | Try to get as many community members to listen in even if it means DM reminders |
| **Codefi_keyz** | The format was very creative, I enjoyed the conversation, hoping more members will join us as time goes by. | The rationales provided with different responses created an avenue into diverse insights from FMs | The fact that we didn't get to enjoy the recorded file, I hope we can try to make this better in the future. | More creative questions and of course guests to throw their questions and also better time management. |
| **xJames** | yes | live conversation | not a lot of viewers. the main idea of the meeting is to present yourself to the community and eventually get more votes for your candidacy | see the previous answer |
| **Hanzo Hazashi** | Yes | The orderliness | Nothing in particular | No |

Conclusion:

1. Request permission to record the meeting.
2. Remind attendees of the rules: responses should be limited to 1-2 sentences. If longer, the moderator should interject to interrupt the speaker.
3. Invite and engage as many listeners as possible.
