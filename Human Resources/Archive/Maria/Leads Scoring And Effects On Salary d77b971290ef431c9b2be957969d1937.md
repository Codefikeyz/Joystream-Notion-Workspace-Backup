# Leads Scoring And Effects On Salary

### The Lead Scoring will be drawn from these 3 metrics:

**1. Workers' Evaluation**

Weight: 20% of the total score

Survey form at the end of the term will be sent out by HR for all the workers. Questions are about the performance and cooperation of the lead inside the Working groups. The average score from the workers will be collected later on.

I have reduced the number of questions from 9 to 5. Plus, I have added one question for feedback, which can improve the future assessment of the WG Leader.

Below are the questions/areas where leads are to be graded, it will be a Google form with linear scale options 1-5 (not satisfactory at all - very satisfactory)

1. Demonstrated effective management skills (Leadership, Decision-making, Communication, Problem-solving) What, in your opinion, can be done better?
2. Keeps the team informed about the working group's status - plans, reports, challenges, milestones, etc.
3. Motivates workers and mentors workers
4. The leader is in contact and helps to solve work issues if needed
5. Demonstrated ethical conduct and honesty in his/her dealing with the workers

- It is also important to take into account that not all workers will take part in the survey. Some employees don't always respond to my messages, forget to, or for any other reasons.
- In regards to the forum group where there are no workers, we can either change the percentage of the influence of results on the Leader's overall score. This option doesn't seem to be the most suitable one as the Leader would need to fulfill more conditions to receive a bonus. Therefore, I suggest reducing the percentage of the final score. So for example, in order to receive a bonus between 15 - 20%, the Leader's Forum score should be 70 points and more. In such a way the conditions of bonus receiving for everyone will stay the same.
- It is possible that later on, we'd need to change the influence of the Workers' Evaluation score on the overall score, in accordance with the number of workers that one leader manages. Since it is absolutely another burden when you manage for example 2-3 people compared to having 15.

### **2. OKRs and Council Tasks Scores.**

Weight: 60%

Assignee: Council and Council Secretary (if the council plans to hire him)

These are the OKRs and tasks put forth by the council.

Grading: Based on the approved [OKRs for Q2](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/216), the author has included a scoring system - that can be adapted, or the council can revise it and come up with a new one.

Since no OKRs have been counted yet and the second quarter has already finished, the Council needs to decide how this grading system will work. When will OKRs be calculated?

Since OKRs are developed quarterly and are one of the significant assessments used for calculating the Final Lead Score, it might make sense to evaluate Lead Scores quarterly and pay bonuses quarterly. The downside is that employee and leader turnover is quite high.

**3. WG group Score I suggest using only objective evaluations.**

Weight: 20%

Assignee: Council Secretary or HR WG

This pertains to the constant metrics and involvement of the working groups:

Grading: I suggest assessing this rating not on a linear scale, but based on completion: done/not done.

1. Working group Plan (Term start + 2day)
2. Working Group Report (7200 blocks (=12h) after term ends)
3. Meetings(Handover (& Mid-term)). Participated or not
4. Communication with the council and leads. The WG Lead should respond within 24 hours.

### Final Lead Score:

Given that the JOY course currently remains in low positions, I would not suggest implementing rating scales that could take away from the already meager salaries of the leaders. Instead, for the present, these rating scales can be used as additional bonuses and the performance of the Leaders can be checked once a quarter. Also, it is important to determine who will be responsible for calculating the results since this task is quite voluminous and needs to take the time to evaluate each group.

### **Effect of the final score on the leads' salary:**

- 80% and above, 20% bonus on top of his salary next term
- 60-70%, 10% bonus on top of his salary next term
- 50-60%, deduction of 10%
- 50 and low - 0 bonus.
