# Feedback from Leads about “Lead Salary Adjustment”

The table shows data from the survey [Joystream Leads Salary Assessment Questionnaire Feedback (notion.so)](https://www.notion.so/Joystream-Leads-Salary-Assessment-Questionnaire-Feedback-3097da3cc1be4334876fd86ed112bdc7?pvs=21) I chatted with a few of the Leads to get a better grasp of the stuff that mattered IMO.

I shared my thoughts, now I'm curious to hear what the Council thinks about the salary and other key points.

|  | **Current Salary, 
JOY per term** | **Key point 1** | **Key point 2** | **Creative solutions**  | **salary expectation in dollars** | **my comment** | **Council comments** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ***Storage Lead*** | 42.151 | **Paperwork**: For paperwork, the report should be enough for now, but if you need to stay on top of things it'd be better to have regular check-ins instead of reports. For visibility, attending council meetings and chatting should be enough for the short term but eventually, most of the info can be automated and shared with the community. | **Leads and Council should make the same salary. 
1.** I think they should be on the same level as the executive and operational branches. Establish a practice of accountability and attract more qualified leads (currently needed in marketing and build). 
**2**. Get the leads more involved in the council by having the leaders of each branch vote on decisions related to their area.
**3**. Encourage people to choose either or not.
**4**. Don't just wait around for the council to do something - try to get the leads more involved. | **An inflation target**
**1.** I still think inflation is the way to go. Remember, if prices go up, we can lower the inflation target, which will have the same effect as the other option but won't cause any trouble if the prices go down - [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176?post=1285](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176?post=1285) | the same as the Council | It looks like the group puts out one report a term, which should be plenty for the Distribution and Storage WGs IMO.

I'm really pleased with what the marketing team achieved, even though they don't shout about it. The outcome is what matters to me, not showy antics.

| ***Builders Lead*** | 41.211 | Base Salary On Percentage Of Inflation [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176) |  |  | 120,000 USD / year = 5,000 USD / term | I agree with James’ opinion - [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176?post=1252](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/176?post=1252) |  |
| ***Forum Lead*** | 8 646 | **Dissatisfaction with salary.** 
I work solo so the responsibility is huge, and semi-technical due to CLI and it's a lead position so council, and jsg, and other leads directly coordinate. | 
 | **Creative solutions.** 
Some tasks can be assigned to the community thru crew3 like graphic designs or infographics. If you check crew3 entries, there are some talented members who contributed good content. This is a good rewarding activity for the community. This will save us joy rather than hiring permanent workers, whom some we don’t even see in discord. | the same as the HR worker or a bit higher | It looks like Songoku is really worth his weight in gold - the Council can give him more to do and reward him with a higher salary.
I like Tomato's suggestion about extra Forum work - [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/12](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/12) |  |
| ***Distribution Lead*** | 41 949 | no answer |  |  |  |  |  |
| ***Content Lead***  | 21.645 | I think unfair payment from Storage WG and especially Distributors WG (below required) |  | The issue of fair compensation now lies in the field of sophistry due to the lack of a token on the exchange. I guess many people stayed in the project because of the idea that Joystream is the future. This is the ideology that needs to be supported. | - I would like an increase (at least to equate to the salaries of other Leads) | 1. I reckon they get a decent wage, taking into account they're shelling out their own money for the paid servers.

I totally agree with Igrex that a lot of people are in this project because they believe in it. So, the Council should make sure everyone is comfortable and not micromanage when there is no need for it (Don't turn the DAO into a corporate business model). |  |
| ***HR Lead*** | 43.410 |  |  | The Lead Scoring system that I have developed is a good start and I hope the Council will be adopting this system and get quite resolute with the output and make good decisions with the result.  |  | Has HR finished setting up the Lead reward system? Can I take a look?

I haven't seen the rating system, so I can't say anything. If the Council has already read this document, I would like to know their opinion. |  |
| ***Marketing Lead*** | 41.920 | I perform a complex task in promoting the Crew3 campaign outside Joystream, this includes telegram-paid announcements and target advertising.
Research on social media platforms, communities, and forums where we can introduce Joystream is also a complex task. |  | Salaries can be only decreased if the value of JOY token will be higher than $0.06 and never increased if the value would be below $0.06. | I expect a budget increase for the marketing working group workers’ salaries.
Numbers that seem to be fair to me:
@adovrn Marketing Representative **0.075** JOY per block
@spat_sochi Marketing Representative **0.075** JOY per block
@kate_fm Content Creator  **0.075** JOY per block // Kate performs multiple amounts of duties (research, content creation, smm updates, crew3 quests reviewing, etc) since she got hired and rewarding her for hard work is important.
@itz Graphic Designer 0.039 JOY per block
@vikan#4315 Market Research Analyst 0.039 JOY per block
And if the Council will think that the lead also deserves more - that will be highly appreciated. | I really appreciate it when a Leader takes care of their workers by asking for a raise and then for themselves. It shows good management and it's really great.

It looks like it would be fair to give bonuses to the workers who worked on the crew3 program when it's done. If funds for additional expenses are planned in the Council budget. |  |
