# Maria’s Feedback on scoring metrics

1. **Level of Engagement.** I would prefer to leave only objective assessments. This is a subjective assessment. How will it be evaluated? I know Leads who are not very active but do their job efficiently. Who will be assigned a score of 10, and who 1? We cannot objectively calculate this.

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: I agree to this, there are no instrument of measurement towards this, inactiveness in Discord, forum, Telegram might not be equaled to inefficiency in responsibilities.**

2. **Alignment with DAO’s Objectives.** I didn't quite get the gist. What should correspond to what? Does the work lead to the goals of the DAO? To do this, long-term plans must be written and approved by the consuls. Are they approved?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: This will be definitely approved by council and responsibilities assigned in line with Council’s long and short term goals, thus Leads tasks being executed in line with these laid out plans, but how will they be measured again?**

3. **Potential impact.** what does it mean? It is better to write estimates more precisely or add explanations.

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: The impact on working groups could be in form of creative means to get tasks done, but this might not work for all leads, say the Storage providers. So again, if we can remove/modify some of these scoring options to be accommodating and most of all measurable.**

4. **DAO Experience?** ok. But it turns out that a person who has been in the DAO for a long time will have superiority over someone who has recently been in the Lead position. That is, the advantage will be on the side of the amount of experience over the quality of work. I don't think this is a good indicator.

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: This is not suggesting, level or years of experience in the Joystream DAO, it is being implied here in the same sense as it is being outlined in a job opening, at least a basic knowledge of how the DAO works aids in getting the Job done efficiently. Again this is up to Council to remove/modify as this experience already qualified a lead for a Job Opening.**

5. **Communication**. It's ok. But here it is necessary to clarify communication with whom? with the Council, with employees, or with DAO?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: For a start, this could be such as responding to a certain percentage of messages from Council within a certain timeframe just as a Lead’s absence could have his reward reduced. A percentage of response rate to Council can be measured.**

6. **Responsiveness** To whose requests? The lead can respond quickly to the Council but ignore other DAO participants. Or is it an average? How will this assessment be made? by a survey or observation method?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: This could be on average, same process as in communication. This is really important as without communication and responsiveness, Leads especially might just be about create plans, do tasks and report and might not actually be actively involved in the other DAO processes asides being a worker.**

7. **Clarity of Ideas.** What ideas do you mean here?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: This could be in regards to group plans, contributions and feedbacks to DAO issues, presenting thoughts and ideas in a clear, easily understandable, and well-defined manner. Again, aiming at measurable options, this can be removed/modified for better decision making.**

8. **Collaborative Mindset** cooperation with whom? How will it be evaluated? What kind of cooperation and with whom will be considered good?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: Cooperation with team members, this can be acquired via a survey from team members.**

9. **Participation in decision-making**. please explain which solutions will be evaluated.

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: A good example of this could be pre proposals by council on issues or decisions with needed inputs from Leads, example is [Mandatory Council And Leads Call (HANDOVER)](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/293)**
10. **Regular meeting attendance**. it's fine. It is clear what is meant and can be evaluated

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: Agreed**

11. **Initiative**. Initiative in what?

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: Initiatives in issues raised by the council, contributing ideas towards a solution.**

12. **Ability to deliver commitments.** if we are talking about setting goals in the group's plan and fulfilling obligations for these tasks, then ok.

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: Agreed**

13. **Meeting Deadlines.** it is necessary to clarify which deadlines. Are specified in the group plan? please be specific!

**Codefikeyz’ Reply: These are working group deadlines specified in the group’s plan**

14. **Quality of work. This is a very difficult assessment. This indicator should be evaluated through OKR and include many indicators. It is impossible to say subjectively whether the work is well or poorly done. It usually includes many indicators.

Codefikeyz’ Reply: This can be modified/removed, the aim is to accomplish the DAO goals in efficiently.**

15. **Submission of Reports/Plans according to Template.** ok

16. **Submission of Reports/Plans within timeframe.** ok****
