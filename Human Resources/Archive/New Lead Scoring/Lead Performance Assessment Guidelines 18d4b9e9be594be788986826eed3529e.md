# Lead Performance Assessment Guidelines

## Workers Evaluation (20 points):

The Workers Evaluation category carries a maximum of 20 points. This score is derived by aggregating individual worker scores and dividing by the total number of workers who participated in the evaluation. A minimum of two responses is required for worker feedback in this category.

**Note:** For the Apps and Forum Working Groups, which have no workers, the allocated 20 points are redistributed equally to the OKR and Council Tasks and Working Group (WG) categories, resulting in 10 points each.
The metrics for the workers evaluations are explained in the evaluation form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfh2ISoc3-qRyBmuxynE05BNa16tXYff2sx_FDOXHaPszZxcA/viewform?usp=pp_url)

## OKRs and Council Tasks (50 or 60 points):

The OKRs and Council Tasks category holds a total of 50 points for most working groups, except for Apps and Forum WG, which have 60 points allocated.

The final score is calculated by summing the scores achieved in each task and dividing by the total number of tasks assigned to the Working Group.

## Working Group Score - Lead (30 or 40 points):

The Working Group Score for Leads is weighted at 30 points for most working groups, with the exception of Apps and Forum WG, which receive 40 points.

This score is derived from aggregating individual metric scores. In most cases, the base score for each metric is set at 6, resulting in a maximum possible score of 30. In contrast, Apps and Forum WG have a base score of 8 for each metric.

## General Notes:

- Tasks can span multiple terms and may have an "In Progress" status, with a score of 25 for other Working Groups and 30 for Apps and Forum WG.
- Scoring scenarios:
    - Best case: Lead excels in all categories and achieves 100 points.
    - Middle case: Lead has tasks in progress, scores 25/50 or 30/60 in OKRs & Council tasks, and earns 15/30 or 20/40 points in Working Group Score and Workers Evaluation, totaling 40 or 50 points.
    - Worst case: Lead does not complete any tasks or earn any points in the Working Group Score.

## Grade Points:

- Excellent = 100 - 80 points: 20% Bonus
- Good = 79 - 60 points: 10% Bonus
- Satisfactory = 59 - 40 points: 5% Bonus
- Needs improvement = 39 - 20 points: Lead receives 80% salary, warning is issued and a new Lead position is opened.
- Poor = 19 - 0 points: Lead receives 80% salary, 20% of stake is slashed, and Lead is terminated.

### **Guideline on Salary payment:**

On implementation of this scoring system, the Leads salaries are set at 80% of the current total amount (e.g from 100k to 80k) the remaining 20% amount for all Leads is sent to HR WG Budget to pay Leads at the end of the term through discretionary funding after the score is being calculated and graded.

The term “bonus” used above is not an additional bonus to the already earned salary, rather the remaining 20% to be earned to the full salary which is now 80% to make it 100%.
