# JS DAO Community Survey

A PLAN FOR A SURVEY TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON HOW TO IMPROVE JOYSTREAM

# Aim of the survey

This survey is aimed at getting community members to open up on their experiences thus far, their reservations and worries, opinions on what to improve on to make Joystream DAO better. with joystream growing daily, there is need for innovation and this falls not just on the council or working groups but on the entire community so this is a good way to get the opinion of  everyone in the community

## Brief description

The survey would be a document containing a list of questions, some to be answered with a click of choice and some requiring personal answers.  in order to motivate and ensure freedom in answers, there should be a reward attached so that any participant receives a certain amount of $JOY, the answers should be reviewed by HR and a data of interpretation should be generated based on majority of the answers, these data will be presented to the council as the wish of the community at large.

### **Budget**

50000 $JOY

100 $JOY for each participant

## Target audience

The minimum target expectation would be at least 100 community members while the maximum target is 500 community members.

## Mode of distribution

HR will include the link to the survey in both discord and telegram announcement for a week to make sure it gets to enough community members to reach a definite data.

## Control method

This simply means making sure there are no multiple sign ups in an attempt to earn more rewards thereby corrupting the survey, to minimize that the HR team will personally vet each username and the date they provided as the day they joined Joystream community.
