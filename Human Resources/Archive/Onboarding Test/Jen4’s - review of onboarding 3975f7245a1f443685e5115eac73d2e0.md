# Jen4’s - review of onboarding

I tried the onboarding myself, here are some key takeaways:

1. Asking newcomers to get verified in #welcome is no longer relevant, simply because for them to see all the channels and post they need to get verified first. Uncertain as well if the HR opening spiel of asking to write on #introduce-yourself channel is effective
2. The process itself of getting verified is quite a lengthy process(took me a couple of minutes cause I read every step, more tabs are necessarily opened for verification), not so convenient for me but I understand that this avoids the bots from entering our server.
3. MAYBE, a bot could really be of help in identifying if a user has passed verification on not. If a newcomer successfully passed the verification (which HR cannot detect unless the newcomer post in any channels), that's when the bot will need to step in and tag the newcomer with a constant spiel asking them to introduce themselves and create a membership in Pioneer. The bot can post in #start here or welcome. #faucet channel in this regard, could also be removed.
4. If No. 3 could be done by the bot, and assuming the newcomer will post in introduce themselves or in any channel, then that would be the start of a real interaction with HR or the community.
5. HR must look into this, perhaps conduct further testing and study. Analyze the results and propose possible solutions.

There are 11 photos below, captioned detailedly with how the verification is done.

After pressing the "accept invite" button, this is what the newcomer sees. This is also the time when it is posted on [#welcome](https://imgur.com/t/welcome)
 channel that a new comer has landed in our server. If anybody tag the newcomer at this moment, this would not appear as a notification on the newcomer's end. Unless, he/she will open this channel after he/she passed verification

A new tab is opened in the browser, notice under "Verify Yourself", that's not the account I used, tried to press the logout button - unresponsive somehow. So I went back to the original tab.

I went back to the original tab, and this is what I see. To get to this page, I spent a couple of minutes, I tried to read and analyze step-by-step verification maybe that's why it took a couple of minutes for me to do it. If somebody fast would do it, it would take maybe a minute.

Only by this time, if somebody would tag the newcomer will appear as a notification on his/her end
