**Plan example -** ‣ 

1. **Current group composition**
You need to specify the current composition of the group.
You can see the current composition of the group through the CLI command - joystream-cli working-groups:overview --group=humanResources
Or you can look here (Section - Workers) - [https://dao.joystream.org/#/working-groups/hr](https://dao.joystream.org/#/working-groups/hr)

2. **Hiring/Firing**
You need to specify how many workers you plan to hire/fire in the new period.
To get a good score "WG Opportunities" you need to hire 20% newcomers of the current number of workers (group leader does not count).
If there are 10 workers in the group (11 including the leader), then you need to hire 2 newcomers to get the maximum score.
Example:
