The most popular type of material among users right now is video. However, have you ever questioned why? It’s because video incorporates non-verbal communication, which provides a higher level of enjoyment and deeper contact with the speaker. The fact that video information engages the eyes and ears is an additional benefit.

Currently, all online material is transitioning to the web 3.0 model, which will employ blockchain technology to create a decentralized system where you will control the stuff you publish online. Your stuff (posts, movies, and other content) won’t ever be removed from the websites; instead, it will live eternally on the blockchain network.

YouTube is currently the most popular site for watching videos.But regrettably, it has a lot of drawbacks.

Drawbacks that will soon lead to YouTube being replaced

— The platform’s increasing usage of obnoxious advertisements causes regular users to visit this site less and less.

— All of your work, including videos, designs, branding, subscribers, and promotions, can be automatically blocked and removed by a moderator or by the system itself, frequently without giving you the chance to make any corrections and frequently without giving a clear explanation.

— Their own video editing facilities are challenging to use; outside resources must be used.

— It might often take dozens of hours to produce videos for the author and submit them to the website.

— Strict rules for content production.

**Atlas: The Future’s Video Platform**

One of the pioneers of our upcoming web 3.0 is Joystream. The fact that it is a DAO-driven video platform implies that there are numerous opportunities to get involved with the project and earn money by making contributions.As a cool new alternative to Youtube, Joystream enables content creators to produce content and immediately monetize it.

We are all aware of YouTube’s severe video content filtering policies and how frequently films are removed from the site. Users won’t tolerate that, so we can address this issue by decentralizing Joystream.

Additionally, a fantastic benefit of the Joystream video platform is that it works hard to give video artists additional options to monetise their recordings.

The primary objective of Joystream is to hold media platforms — primarily their users, whether they are consumers, artists, freelancers, or employees — responsible for the people they influence.

The second important advantage is that content producers can design their own currencies and have Joystream’s blockchain reward them for their video mining in the form of non-functional tokens (NFTs).
