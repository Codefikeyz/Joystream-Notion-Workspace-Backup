# **What are the issues of DAOs?**

The main problems that **DAOs** are often asked to cure. Each is focused on the same goal: building a system where people don’t need to trust each other to work.

The first of these is censorship protection. The power of big tech companies has led to growing public concern about the limitations on free speech that can be imposed by central power. In theory, DAOs can prevent any one actor from having significant control over the majority of users of a product or service: for example, a few executives with the power to decide the prospects of it there and are not allowed to see him decide ; banks controlling large parts of the financial system and even governments with considerable power over their electorate.

## **Poor Infrastructures**

Since DAOs are purely digital and decentralized, they often lack a well-developed and efficient infrastructure their traditional counterparts enjoy. Many DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’.

The answer is a “both/and” solution. Instead of fully autonomous DAOs, we can use the infrastructure of decentralization to create organizational structures that support both decentralized decision-making and executive function, with the consent of all involved users.

## **Navigating Blockchains and Contracts — Risks & Un-immutability**

Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security.

Many smart contract networks have faced a series of attacks with some protocols drained of millions of dollars sometimes. For example, the first DAO known as “The DAO” is a typical example of the impact of such vulnerabilities. A more recent event is [the $120 million hack of BadgerDAO](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-hack-bitcoin-ethereum).

This solution addresses the reality that not all governance matters are equally sensitive, and do not require “votes of the people.” Instead, the majority of participants could vote on important matters, while conceptual questions that require fast decision-making could be decided by a narrower group of participants being properly informed.

This solution also offers a pathway to creating the right balance between a DAO’s initial creators and the community it builds over time. Done correctly, this shift in governance promotes intense participation from early-stage builders who are in it for the “long-haul,” and gradually gives control to the community over time. Providing the right incentives for building this community is essential to this process: users need to be rewarded for their contributions, and ideally, they should get more than they give. For example, due to our unique revenue-sharing model, Ignium’s issuing companies can receive more than they pay — one company recently received 3.5x the amount of money they contribute monthly.

There is no doubt that DAOs will play an important role in the future of organizations across many industry verticals. But we must acknowledge that problems often arise when we start resolving trust issues with automation. While automation provides efficiency, it is usually not the authority in complex matters.

Getting the balance right will take time. And after all, Rome was not built in one day. And while automation will solve many problems in our society, we should still have faith in human integrity — while being aware of its weaknesses.

Since most of DAOs’ members are usually anonymous, compliance with AML/KYC policies is very complicated, if not impossible. Also, because DAOs can include individuals from around the world, multiple jurisdictions´ laws are at play. Deciding which country´s laws apply can be difficult and is likely to result in legal battles if a dispute arises. To limit any money laundering risks, DAOs should use one of the AML/KYC providers to verify member’s identities, but it can be difficult to find reliable providers.
