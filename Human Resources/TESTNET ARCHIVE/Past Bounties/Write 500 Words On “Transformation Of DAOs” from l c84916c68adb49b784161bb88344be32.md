# **Transformation of DAOs**

## **Hello friends! I want to continue my story about DAO! Today we will talk about the transformation of DAO and what to expect from them in the future.**

#Joystream is a decentralized video platform running on its own blockchain (using the Substrate framework), and this project can be called a polka dot parachain. The development team strives to create an ecosystem in which each participant can manage the system and receive certain rewards for this.

The DAO is moving towards official recognition. When Wyoming became the first state in the US to recognize CryptoFed DAO as a legal business entity, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) moved from an esoteric concept largely confined to the Web3 community into something that merited the attention of the wider world.

The philosophy of the crypto-utopian is to replace flawed institutions in the fiat world by building a blockchain-based version from scratch.

Cryptocurrency was not originally conceived as an asset class, but as an alternative payment system. Smart contracts are an attempt to make an incorruptible form of legal governance. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is combining both to create an entire financial system (loans, deposits, payments, insurance) that is fairer, more reliable, and more efficient than the one that imploded in 2008. As for the DAO, it is the re-imagined on-chain version of the traditional corporation.

While it was Stan Larimer who created the concept of a DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Corporation), inspired by science fiction novels, it was Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, who later rebranded the concept as a ‘DAO’.

He defined it simply as “an entity that lives on the Internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that automata itself cannot accomplish.” The AI component, he went on to emphasize, must be central, with the human component supporting.

In fact, DAO can be not only a cryptocurrency project, but also various venture funds, startups, NFTs. The name of the DAO is determined precisely by the properties with which it is endowed.

1) *Cryptocurrency companies and projects.* The most common example. For a project to call itself a DAO, it must have a voting system and project management through its tokens. These companies include Maker DAO, 1Inch and many more.

2) *Investment funds.* It is also extremely common in the DAO segment, since such funds allow collective voting and investment decisions.

3) *NFT investments.* There are projects that invest in various NFTs. DAO organizations also often meet there. The system is similar to the previous paragraph. For example, PleasrDAO.

4) *Educational DAOs.* Some organizations are developing the direction of education in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, voting for the further addition of new details to the courses.

5) *Legal DAOs.* Such companies are trying to combine law and smart contract technology.

## [**The future of the DAOs**](https://minfin.com.ua/invest/articles/chto-takoe-dao-i-pri-chem-zdes-kompanii-buduschego/)

The peak of DAO development came in 2021, when there was a wave of development of large DAO funds, crypto companies and NFT projects. It is logical to assume that these organizations will continue to develop smoothly and consistently. And also qualitatively pump all your parameters.

In 2021, a wave of investment DAOs emerged where token holders could invest in NFTs, Web3 projects, cryptocurrencies, or other DAOs. An example of such an organization is the PleasrDAO, originally created to buy the work of the artist pplpleasr. She subsequently amassed an impressive collection of NFTs: the original Doge meme, the only copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” and Edward Snowden’s first NFT.

Many experts predict a strong development of DAO in 2022–2023. We are waiting for a real trend towards autonomous decentralized organizations. Much of this will be due to a potential wave of DAO recognition. Soon, DAOs around the world will begin to be recognized by states and enter the legal field of activity. For example, already in 2021, some US states passed laws recognizing DAOs as a new form of companies.

In addition, DAO expects a qualitative update of the systems themselves and working services. For example, the principle of voting will become even simpler, and the distribution of roles between users will reach a new level. This will increase the efficiency of the entire system as a whole.

## **As you can see, DAO is like a new breath in the development and improvement of business structures. I hope my article was helpful to you. Thank you [#Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/) for the opportunity to express yourself!**
