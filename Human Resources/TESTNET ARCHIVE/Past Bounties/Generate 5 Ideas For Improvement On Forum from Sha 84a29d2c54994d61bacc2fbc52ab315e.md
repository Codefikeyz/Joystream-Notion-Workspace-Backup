1. Make rewards for invited users, who will also not only enter the server, but participate in the program and complete tasks
2. Share Joystream on your real personal social media account (Instagram or Facebook)
3. Make all completed tasks completely closed so that no one except the admin can see the text of the work
4. Do a task: put the Joystream logo in your discord and do not remove it for a certain period
5. Make a task for all server participants to give in a chat on different topics. Thus, you can well increase the activity in the forum
