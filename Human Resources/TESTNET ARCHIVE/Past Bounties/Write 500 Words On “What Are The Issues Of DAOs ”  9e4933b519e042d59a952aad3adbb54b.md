# **What Are The Issues Of DAOs?**

If we are talking about DAO, it is a decentralized autonomous organization that is governed and controlled by its community. They are also made possible by blockchain and the monetary incentives that exist in web3. Ideally, a DAO would have no central leaders — their destiny would be determined by the community alone, using democratic means.

There is no CEO here to authorize spending on a personal whim, and no chance of a CFO manipulating the books. Everything is open, and the rules for spending are laid out in the DAO through its code.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are slowly gaining popularity in today’s Web 3.0 and even beyond, as more people begin to explore possible ways to invest in them.

Although DAOs look promising in my opinion, they are still a young invention that has some problems and challenges that need to be addressed.

First of all, it is poor infrastructure and legal issues.

Due to the fact that DAOs are extremely digital and decentralized, they often lack the developed and efficient infrastructure that their traditional analogs use. Many DAOs have to develop the right tools and infrastructures themselves before launching, and most of these tools are quite bizarre.

In addition, DAOs suffer from a lack of the necessary infrastructure for reporting, managing cashiering, governance, payroll, communications, identity management, etc. Without the necessary infrastructure to perform these duties, many DAOs may lose their members and ultimately fail to gain traction.

However, the increasing pace of innovation and collaboration in the Web3 space is slowly helping to solve some of these problems.

Moreover, DAOs share similarities with many modern organizations, such as corporations, non-profit organizations, partnerships (both full and limited liability), and cooperatives. But all of these organizations are regulated and governed by the rules of the various countries in which they exist.

A further problem is effective coordination or complete decentralization.

The governance structure in most DAOs is a typical one-man-one-vote democratic system. Although this structure has many advantages, it is not the best way to actively manage corporations, especially when the decisions to be made require specialized knowledge.

Another important problem the DAO has to face is the lack of token holders to vote on proposals. Inactive token holders can disrupt DAO functionality. And while many of them can quickly decide to delegate votes, this also creates the centralization problem discussed above. Some DAOs are exploring using incentives to solve this problem by rewarding active token holders and penalizing inactive ones.

This is going to be quite a complex issue for DAOs trying to find the right governance. The approach taken by various organizations will prove vital in determining the future of DAOs.

Whatever it is, I believe that the future belongs to DAO and all problems can be solved!
