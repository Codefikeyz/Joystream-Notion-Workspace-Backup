# **Issues of DAO’s**

Decentralized autonomous organisations (DAOs) such as Joystream are gradually gaining traction in the Web3 space and even beyond as many are beginning to explore possible ways of investing in one.Considering how bitcoin and DeFi have rewarded early investors handsomely, web3 enthusiasts are looking to jump on the DAO ship with the aim of making huge returns on their investments in the near future.However, it’s important to explore some of the challenges that DAOs face:

· Poor Infrastructures: Since DAOs are purely digital and decentralized, they often lack a well-developed and efficient infrastructure their traditional counterparts enjoy. Many DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’.DAOs suffer from having the right infrastructures for reporting, treasury management, governance, payroll, communication, identity management, etc. Without the right infrastructure to handle these duties, many DAOs may lose members and eventually fail to gain traction.

· Navigating Blockchains and Contracts — Risks & Un-immutability: Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security. Many smart contract networks have faced a series of attacks with some protocols drained of millions of dollars sometimes. For example, the first DAO known as “The DAO” is a typical example of the impact of such vulnerabilities. A more recent event is the $120 million hack of BadgerDAO. Division within a DAO can lead to fragmentation and result in splits.

· Governance Issues: DAOs are based on blockchain technology principles; hence, they tend to favour a governance model rooted in those principles.

· High Operational Costs: Most DAOs work and operate with funding in cryptocurrency, and every crypto transaction has transaction fees associated with it, sometimes referred to in crypto parlance as “gas fees.” These fees are used to compensate other actors using computing power to validate crypto transactions. To execute a transaction in say ether (the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin), the user must pay “gas fees” to validate and store the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.

· Choosing the Right Tools to Operate a DAO:Traditional businesses have a wide array of off-the-self software products and business applications (in addition to the service of lawyers and accountants) at their disposal to support and facilitate their day-to-day operations. This is not yet the case in the web3 world.

· A lack of tooling is a major obstacle for DAOs to run smoothly and productively. This refers to the available tools that can ensure efficient treasury management, pay-outs, reimbursement, community interaction, decision making and effective governance. DAOs are still in their infancy, and a lot more needs to be done to make it easier, for example, for all DAO participants to vote in an expedient manner, or to determine subsequent activities to be carried out after a vote.
