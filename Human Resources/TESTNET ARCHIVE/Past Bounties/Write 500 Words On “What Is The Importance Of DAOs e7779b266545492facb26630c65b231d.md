# **1. What is DAOs?**

Cryptocurrency ecosystems work very differently from traditional companies: instead of a central management system, they have a collective intelligence, and everyone in the system can offer their own solution. What is DAO and why is it important?DAO is an acronym that quite simply stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is such an autonomous system in blockchain that is controlled by software code and does not depend on the notorious human factor.

The main feature of DAO is that it does not have a central node that manages the entire system without coordination with other participants. In other words, there is no hierarchical structure in decentralized autonomous organizations, and all participants in the ecosystem have the same rights and can vote for changes in the protocol on an equal basis with other participants. This is the simplest answer to the question, what is DAO in cryptocurrency.

# **2. How DAOs works**

Let’s understand how DAOs work. Within the DAO, all decisions are made collectively. That is, any member of the system can propose improvements for the decentralized protocol, and if the rest of the community votes for them, they will be accepted.

Developers can’t implement changes without community approval, but only add new code when members have accepted the improvements.

This principle is fundamentally different from the election of members of the government: the electorate votes only for candidates, but does not decide on the adoption of new laws. Instead, the DAO proposes to vote on exactly the changes that need to be made to the protocol, without the need to delegate authority to any person or group of people.Thus, in a decentralized autonomous organization, the role of the manager is played by the program, but it does not make decisions on its own: the community does, and the program only follows instructions.Information about all transactions is stored in the blockchain, and any user can always check what is happening on the network. Therefore, DAO is not only decentralized, but also transparent.

In terms of internal architecture and governance structure, DAO also differs from traditional companies. Traditional companies have a tiered structure. At the top level is management, and then there are several sub-levels, and the lower the level, the less authority.

# **3. The importance of DAO**

Why is the DAO important these days? First of all, thanks to **decentralization**.

The term DAO says a lot about the reasons it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as obvious answers to your doubts. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete decentralization.DAOs use blockchain to determine members’ voting rights in proposals to shape the future of an organization or project. At the same time, the benefits of decentralized autonomous organization are also important components of the web3 landscape. As such, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in today’s consumer-facing environments.

DAOs do not transfer control of a business or organization to one person or group. On the contrary, control over the business and enterprise rests with a group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the benefits of the DAO have also been marked by the introduction of tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on various improvement proposals and protocol.

The main advantage of DAO is centered on decentralization, an important feature of decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs are focused on achieving the maximum degree of decentralization in accordance with their core design principles. The concept of complete decentralization usually loses value in other endeavors. However, the equation changes in the case of DAOs, which rely on collective participation rather than dependence on one person.With the decentralization benefits of DAO, members of an organization can have a say in the future of the organization. Many of you may point out that DAOs are not fully decentralized due to DAO tokens. How? Well, participants with more DAO tokens will likely have more voting rights. However, voting rights are distributed much more than in traditional organizations with centralized leadership

DAOs allow communities around the world to communicate with each other and work together to achieve productive goals. Anyone can enter the web3 world with just an Internet connection and DAO control tokens.Participation in DAO provides the unique value advantage of participating in new projects, such as creating new domains or new cryptocurrencies to earn money. In addition, the benefits of a decentralized autonomous organization also reflect how DAO members can have a sense of ownership. As a result, they can encourage members to innovate and set new precedents for financial rewards in exchange for participation.Each DAO member has the unique privilege of shaping the future of the organization. Stakeholders in the DAO can make suggestions to improve and change protocols. The most important thing here is that DAOs do not limit the decision-making rights of the board of directors. Through the promising input of a few DAO members, the organization can innovate.

Within the DAO, all decisions are made collectively. That is, any member of the system can propose improvements to the decentralized protocol, and if the rest of the community votes for them, they will be accepted.Developers can not introduce changes without the agreement of the community, and add new code only when the participants accepted the improvements.

# **4. Joystream as an example of a DAO**

Joystream is a decentralized video hosting service on the DAO blockchain, which is managed and owned by all its users at once. It has no centralized owner, because it is a project on the blockchain. You can also become a board member and manager of this system in the test version. And for this — the platform will pay rewards or encourage tokens and so you can earn right now.The community of the project can unite in multiple working groups and engage in common cause. Create proposals to improve the project and vote for similar proposals and other features of a decentralized autonomous organization.Joystream is a full-fledged decentralized autonomous organization, which is quite rare today, because many projects call themselves DAO, in fact, they are not.
