# **The Current State Of Joystream DAO**

In order to talk about the current state of Joystream , you need to go a little deeper into the past, namely to look back and see what has already been done. And a lot has already been done. Let’s go!l

What is Joystream?

Joystream is a decentralized video platform and blockchain. It’s powered by the native $JOY token. They built an application called Atlas, which is similar to video platforms that you are already familiar with, but it uses the underlying Joystream blockchain to let you upload videos to your channel, build up your subscriber count, sell your videos as NFTs, and even create your own token for your channel so that people can invest in you. Those token holders can earn a share of the revenue you generate, get early access to your videos, and all sorts of cool things that you control.

What are the advantages of Joystream?

The main advantage of the Joystream platform is that Joystream is a DAO.

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and has been referred to as ‘An internet community with a shared bank account.

A DAO is the attempt to align the incentives of the consumers, or users of a product, with those running the organization. This is done by the use of tokens. By holding tokens, you become a partial owner of the organization, the same way that a stock gives you partial ownership of a company.

The difference is that you can use your ownership to influence the decisions of the organization. For example, you can apply to becoming a council member, or vote in the council member election. You can upload a proposal to suggest a new idea, and it will be voted on by the council. You can use your ownership to get your say in the direction of the organization, and not in a theoretical way, but in actual on-chain voting that cannot be defrauded. Also, everything is transparent, and out in the open for anyone to see, including budget & salaries.

How can anyone become part of the Joystream team?

The Joystream platform has a group of people who are founding members.

The Founding Members program is like an ambassador program where at least 20% of the genesis supply of JOY tokens will be allocated to people who contribute to the organization in a meaningful way.

Joystream, which you know by now, is a decentralized organization. This means we need people in place to run and operate the whole platform, and so we thought the best way to attract those people.. people like you.. would be to bribe you.

20% of JOY tokens will be split between the Founding Members, and anyone, yourself included, can become a Founding Member simply by contributing meaningful work to the platform.

Joystream also has top leaders and they are called Counsil Group. The Joystream council is a group of individuals that have been elected by token holders to improve the platform. They’re sort of the leaders of the platform, who strategically vote on proposals, hire and fire working group leads, give assignments, and so on. They’re sort of a mix of a board member and a chief executive, if we think of traditional company structure.

At the moment, only 5 people make up the Counsil Group, but who knows, maybe you can become one of them? After all, this is the advantage of Joystream, anyone can become anyone! There is no CEO, we are all directors, we are all equally responsible for the development of our common Joystream platform. Who knows, maybe Joystream is the new YouTube?

At the moment, the Joystream roadmap looks like this:

- Oct 4th: 3rd community test
- Oct 21st: Carthage network release
- Dec 1st: Mainnet release

Bottom line: Current State Of Joystream DAO is in a development stage where everyone, I emphasize — absolutely everyone, can enter the project and become a founding member. It’s never too late to turn your life around and make it better! Come with us to Joystream!
