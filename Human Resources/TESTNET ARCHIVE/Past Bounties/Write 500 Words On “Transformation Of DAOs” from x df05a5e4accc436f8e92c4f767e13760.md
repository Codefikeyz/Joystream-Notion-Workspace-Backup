# **Transformation Of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*shpWVd4iyKclSiSVjI7Akw.png)

I have previously written about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that have become a dominant force in the news and have emerged across industries. They have appeared in blockchain, sports, politics, and the entertainment industry.DAOs bring people together around a common goal or interest. Taken a closer look, DAOs show how large groups of people can be organized as a decision-making body that will ultimately change the way businesses operate.DAOs will influence how businesses are structured, as well as how people lead and are recognized in companies. Ultimately, DAOs will provide a happier and healthier work environment for everyone involved.

DeFi originated from the desire of the blockchain community to create an open, permissionless, decentralized financial system. Thus, DAOs offered an attractive way for projects to demonstrate their commitment to decentralization through community governance.

As a result, in 2020, when DeFi began to gain momentum rapidly, governance tokens have become very popular. Flagship DeFi applications including Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) have launched tokens that allow users to participate in decentralized governance, while new DeFi projects have started launching their governance tokens from the get-go.

So why are DAOs causing such a buzz right now, even among the mainstream news outlets? One reason is the surge in popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are meant to play a larger role in the governance of the DAO and who can participate.

DAOs meet all the requirements of a purpose-driven organization as set out by EY Ireland: active leadership, integrated purpose, clear communication, aligned incentives, empowered employees, established core values, performance metrics and beliefs. DAOs can even use KPIs to incentivize performance. The Joystream client already includes a fundraising module that takes crowdfunding beyond any geographic or legal barriers, and as the world moves towards a more focused economy, this combination of human and technological factors is a particularly powerful dynamic for raising and allocating capital.DAOs are especially useful in areas where current incentive models actively work against societal goals. The best example of this is the field of intellectual property (IP), which is a veritable ‘dark forest’ of mismatched incentives. Inventive companies can often run into trouble from professional “patent trolls” who file a large number of patents for the sole purpose of enforcing annoying claims despite not using the patented technology themselves. It is a perverse fact in the pharmaceutical industry that since natural products cannot be patented, researchers are interested in focusing their energies on creating new compounds rather than discovering naturally occurring ones. Not only is this highly inefficient, but it also means that rainforests are only valued as timber.History proves once again that bureaucracy, with its information deficit and rules, will always lose out to conflict-free alternatives. Plumbers have a saying that “water always wins” and the DAO proves that if anyone tries to control the liquidity of ideas, they will eventually burst.

Investment DAOs are another emerging trend as some believe that DAOs will completely disrupt the traditional venture capital funding model. These DAOs allow groups of Web3 natives to pool and allocate capital in such a way that individuals can now compete with traditional financial institutions.

In addition, many tools have recently appeared to ensure the functioning of the DAO (Colony, Snapshot, Tally, Syndicate, Coinshift and others), which undoubtedly make the life of the DAO easier and more convenient.

I think that today’s DAOs are still at an early stage, we are waiting for a long way of their evolution, after which DAOs will become truly DAOs in the broadest sense of the word.
