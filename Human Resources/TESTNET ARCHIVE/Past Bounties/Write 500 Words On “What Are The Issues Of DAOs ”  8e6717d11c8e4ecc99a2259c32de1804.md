# **Issues of DAOs**

What’s DAO?

DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization in the blockchain, which is controlled by program code and does not depend on the human factor in any way.

The main feature of the DAO is that it does not have a central node — the “boss”, which manages the entire system without coordination with other participants. In other words, there is no hierarchical structure in decentralized autonomous organizations, and all ecosystem participants have the same rights and can vote for changes in the protocol on an equal basis with other participants, control is distributed among team members, and not concentrated around one authoritative person. In addition, the DAO uses smart contracts and governance tokens, just as in Joystream (Discord) the token it uses is known as tjoy, to enable participants to make consensus decisions about the allocation of the organization’s resources. In the absence of the need for human intervention or centralized coordination, DAOs are often referred to as trustless systems.

**Risks of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization**

**(DAO)**

One of the main disadvantages of decentralized autonomous organizations is the legal uncertainty that prevents their use. The problem is aggravated by the fact that once the system is implemented in a private or public organization, it will not be possible to establish control over it.

Another disadvantage is the controversial efficiency of the ecosystem. On the one hand, if we are talking about global changes to the DAO, then they outplay a huge bureaucratic system that requires huge investments in both time and finances. But in the case of small changes, a decentralized approach can be not only useless, but also harm the system. According to experts, a hybrid approach to management will be the most effective.

Partial centralization also presents a certain problem. The initial rules are pre-set in the code of the protocol by its creators, and, as a rule, they cannot be changed. But this problem can be solved if initially the contract provides for the possibility of modifying the original rules.

In addition, vote weight is determined by the number of tokens, not users. This plays into the hands of the “whales”, who have concentrated most of the funds, to manipulate the platform and take control of it into their own hands.

Despite the high potential of the blockchain in managing systems, it hides many risks associated with the security of the protocol. The infamous case with The DAO platform in 2016 is a clear example of

When all members are involved in every move within an organization, it can result in sluggish developments and progress. Members may take a long time to understand and decide on project changes and development. For example, if the DAO wants to buy a non-fungible token (NFT), they might need to explain the NFT to some members. Sometimes, other members don’t understand it, and members who are explaining it might have difficulty in explaining it to everyone. It creates bottlenecks that can potentially lead to them losing the NFT to someone else interested in buying it who can act swiftly.

Also, the program cannot read votes intuitively as with traditional voting with a human touch. Some might argue that automation dehumanizes and removes the aspect of critical thinking, which is crucial for some pivotal organizational changes.

Being democratized and decentralized, DAO members abide by the opinions and decisions of the majority. It may get rid of manipulation, but there is still a risk of conspiracy.

The developers cannot ensure the flawlessness and security of the code which is the foundation of the DAO. Codes may be imperfect and susceptible to hacking.

In 2016, an incident led to the demise of the DAO of German startup stock.it, where the code had loopholes in it for hackers to exploit. They ended up losing $50 million out of the $150 million funds that were raised for the creation of a decentralized version of Airbnb. Although a major setback, instances like this have led to the improvement of technology and increased the security and auditing standards of DAOs.

As Web3 expands and potentially becomes ubiquitous in the future, the DAO has an important role in driving growth and governance systems within blockchain ecosystems. Risks must be addressed, and benefits be enhanced to develop superior technology that can give way to optimized user experience, security and scalability within Web3.
