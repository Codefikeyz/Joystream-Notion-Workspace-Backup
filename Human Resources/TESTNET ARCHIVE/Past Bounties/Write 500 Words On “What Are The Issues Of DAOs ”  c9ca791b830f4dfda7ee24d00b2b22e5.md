# **“What are the issues of DAOs?”**

**Meaning of DAOs:**

Wikipedia defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

A DAO’s financial transactions and rules are recorded on a blockchain. This eliminates the need to involve a third party in a financial transaction, simplifying those transactions through smart contracts. The firmness of a DAO is a smart contract. The smart contract represents the rules of the organization and holds the Organization’s storage. No one can edit the rules without people noticing, because DAOs are transparent and public. Up to today we are used to companies backed by legal status, a DAO may perfectly function without it as it can be structured as a general partnership. Joystream is a typical example of DAOs and one of the best that I’ve witnessed so far and I recommend it for you.

**Issues of DAOs**

**Legal issues:** The laws make it such that DAOs render members to unlimited liability arising from other members’ actions, DAOs cannot hold property in its own name, DAOs create tax problems for members, DAOs’ voted resolutions may not have legal force, and DAOs may be regulated by investment laws. DAOs are effectively unincorporated associations. The law holds every person in the group to liability for everything the group does (through any of its members). This means that if one member purports to act for the group and gets into trouble, everyone else will be responsible and have to bear the debts.

It is not a separate legal entity and cannot sue or be sued in its own name. It would be a nightmare to have to administratively maintain a collective legal action represented by certain representative members.

It cannot own property (including intellectual property) or enter into contracts in its own name but only do so through certain of its members as trustees — meaning there’s a risk that such trustees could take off with assets and the other members have little practical recourse.

It probably would have difficulty maintaining a bank account for fiat money.

If the group receives income, each member would probably be taxed on income each receives.

The group exists by contract. So, the contract terms, whatever they may be, govern the relationships between the members. Depending on the terms of the constitution contract, decisions of the group recorded as resolutions may not even have binding contractual force. The mechanisms for decision making must be clearly spelt out in the constitutional contract.

**Other issues associated:**

Despite the huge potential of DAOs, there are also many associated problems. DAOs are particularly vulnerable to collusion and oligarchy. If a few members hold too much power, they can turn the virtuous cycle of DAO governance on its head. Instead of all users being incentivized to make the DAO more prosperous to make their own stake in it more valuable, powerful bad actors may abuse a DAO for their own financial gain.

DAOs also incentivize the economic development of a protocol, which dampens all non-financial motivations a certain DAO could have. For example, if a DAO focused on seed investing in green projects distributes its governance tokens and a majority of participants decide to simply invest in the most financially viable projects, there is nothing the DAO can do about it.

Another example of a problem could be a DAO focused on promoting new NFT artists where the community votes to buy certain artworks from those new artists. There is a risk that financial interests could take over human ones, with the community focusing on the most lucrative deals rather than promoting new artists.

While a clear framework and governing structure can be coded into a smart contract, some things like culture and social values are not the ideal candidates for code. In that case, it’s down to the prerogative of the community to evolve in a direction that matches its defining ideology. The fluidity of DAOs is a strength in a fast-evolving world, but it’s also one of its most important vulnerabilities as financial interests have a built-in advantage due to the governance model.
