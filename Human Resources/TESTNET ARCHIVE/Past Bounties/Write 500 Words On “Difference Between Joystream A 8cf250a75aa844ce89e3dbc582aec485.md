# **Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

**UNDERSTANDING DAO.**

Let’s understand how DAOs work. Within the DAO, all decisions are made collectively. That is, any member of the system can propose improvements for the decentralized protocol, and if the rest of the community votes for them, they will be accepted. Developers cannot implement changes without community approval, but only add new code when members have accepted the improvements.

In a decentralized autonomous organization, the role of the manager is played by the program, but it does not make decisions on its own! — this is done by the community, and the program only executes instructions.

Information about all transactions is stored in the blockchain, and any user can always check what is happening on the network. Therefore, DAO is not only decentralized, but also transparent.

In terms of internal architecture and management structure, DAO also differs from traditional companies. Ordinary companies have a multi-level structure. At the top level is leadership, and then there are several sublevels and the lower the level, the less authority. In our case, DAO has a single-level architecture, thereby removing the hierarchical structure.

I want to emphasize that DAO solves the age-old problem that is present in almost every industry and organization — the principal-agent dilemma.

When the system is structured in such a way that one person (the “agent”) has the ability to make decisions on behalf of another person (the “principal”), there is a risk of divergent goals, priorities, or access to important information by the parties involved. This is the principal-agent dilemma, which means that the agent can act in accordance with his own interests, and as practice shows, this problem can lead to disastrous consequences.

Currently this dilemma is common among a wide range of public and private organizations. To solve this dilemma by reducing or bypassing hierarchy or centralized coordination, DAOs are referred to as trustless systems. By ensuring that incentive structures and information flows within an organization are properly coordinated in the code, DAOs play a central role in mitigating typical problems associated with the principal-agent dilemma.

The DAO is needed in the joystreamDAO, crypto projects etc.

**Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

Now, there are a huge number of examples of DAO, but I have identified a few of the most popular organizations.

1.JoystreamDAO

2.MakerDAO

3.Uniswap

4.Ethereum etc.

Ethereum — Ethereum became one of the first fully autonomous platforms. Although ethereum lacks complex mechanisms for platform management and voting, it is its smart contracts that formed the basis of DAO platforms.

MakerDAO — One of the first platforms to launch DAI stablecoins, which are pegged to the price of the dollar, was MakerDAO. Maker is one of the largest DeFi lending protocols. The protocol was originally run by the Maker Foundation, but management later decided to step aside and put the protocol in the hands of the community.

Uniswap — The leading automated market maker (AMM) is the Uniswap platform, which combines the functions of a crypto exchange and a DeFi protocol, allowing users to become liquidity providers. The platform has strong support in the face of a huge community of users.

Amongst all the DAOs, there is a big difference between the JoystreamDAO and others.

The joystreamDAO is video oriented unlike most DAOs , it makes use of a video cum NFT platform known as Atlas.

Members of joystream community use this platform to showcase their wonderful videos as well as mint them as NFT

Publishing of videos into the atlas uses a minumum cost of the Joystream native token known as the Joystream tJOY.

The JoystreamDAO works with polkadot extension on PCs and the Polkadot security is more trusted security to the public.
