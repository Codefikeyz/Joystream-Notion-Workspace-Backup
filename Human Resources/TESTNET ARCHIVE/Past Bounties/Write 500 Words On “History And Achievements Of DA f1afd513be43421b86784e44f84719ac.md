# **History and achievements of DAOs**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations — is an effective way to work with like-minded people from all over the world. Think of them as an Internet organization that is collectively managed and owned by its members. Many projects are well known to you, UniSwap, BitDao, Joystream, but few people realize that they are full-fledged DAOs. If enough people are willing to work toward a common goal, they can organize and work to change and shape the future as they see fit.

# **The birth of the DAO**

The first references to DAO appeared in the 1990s to describe multi-agent systems in the Internet environment. The modern meaning of the DAO can be traced back to the concept of the Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC), which has emerged almost as a synonym for Bitcoin. The DAC model was used as a concept in early forums and chats by early crypto enthusiasts and referred to a governance model that used tokenized shares as a means of paying dividends to shareholders. Because the term was associated with a corporate governance model, it was considered too restrictive and was therefore dropped.

At the end of 2013, this concept resurfaced thanks to an article by V. Buterin, in which he proposed the term “decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAO) to describe the “holy grail” of types of organizations, “an entity that lives on the Internet and exists autonomously, but also in relies heavily on hiring people to perform certain tasks that the machine itself cannot perform.”

It was believed that the most important and basic characteristics of the DAO in this sense are “decentralization” and “autonomy”.

**“Decentralized”** reflects a “code is law” organization whose day-to-day operations are based on a decentralized infrastructure where the community is not controlled by a small group of shareholders or an individual.**“Autonomy”** is expressed in the fact that its daily operations are programmed and automatically performed when certain conditions are met.

While some may argue that Bitcoin is actually the first DAO, the term is today understood to refer not to the blockchain network per se, but rather to organizations deployed as smart contracts on top of the existing blockchain network.

# **Evolution of the DAO**

In May 2016, several members of the Ethereum community announced the creation of the first DAO called The DAO, which quickly became one of the biggest spectacles in the Ethereum blockchain community. Prior to launch, The DAO had an initial creation period during which people could send ether to a unique wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens on a scale of 1 to 100. The DAO ended up raising 12.7 million ether ($150 million at that time). moment or $44.4 billion according to today’s estimate). Essentially, the platform will allow people to submit their ideas to the community and receive funding to implement them. However, the experiment was short-lived when, a month after its launch, The DAO was hacked.

# **The largest DAO today**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations have gained popularity over the past few years and are now fully incorporated into many blockchain projects. For example, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space uses DAO to allow applications to become fully decentralized.

A few examples of the largest DAOs today and the areas they cover

**BitDAO** — is a decentralized investment fund backed by PayPal founder Peter Thiel, designed to allow anyone to buy a stake in web3 and de-fi related startups and initiatives.

**Uniswap** — is a decentralized financial protocol used to exchange cryptocurrencies. The protocol facilitates automatic transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts.

**Joystream** — it is an open source video decentralized platform that is controlled, owned and operated by its users. Users can download, view, rate, comment, add to favorites and share certain videos.

# **Near future of DAO**

As Internet organizations, DAOs have the potential to completely change the way corporate governance is run. As the concept matures and the legal gray area they operate in clears up, more and more organizations can adopt the DAO model to help manage some of their activities.
