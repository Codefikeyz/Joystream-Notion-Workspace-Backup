The global pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of work and the work experience. Stranded at home, millions of workers across the globe replaced daily commutes, office desks and watercooler chats with Zoom calls. Cue the next evolution in the virtualization of work, the metaverse; essentially an application of spatial computing that will see us using our avatars to work, meet, learn, socialize, play, trade and transact in fully immersive virtual environments. Media hype notwithstanding, the metaverse is already here. It’s difficult to understand just how revolutionary Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are unless you’ve attempted to navigate financial regulation, set up a payroll or establish a charity. The latter can take years and involve recruiting trustees, choosing an organizational structure, writing a governing document and getting approval from the national Charity Commission with supporting documents and proof of income. In contrast, a fully-operational Aragon DAO with a transparent treasury and direct democracy of all members is a sovereign digital jurisdiction, which can be funding projects within 5 minutes. DAOs are not government-subsidized like charities, but what might be added by subsidies can be subtracted multiple times over in time and administration costs. As society grasps just how easy it is to self-organize in this way, we will see a Cambrian explosion of activity that will do for organizations what the internet did for communication. the DAO space is evolving at an incredible pace. This article can only cover a fraction of the projects that exist and even fewer of the novel use cases that are being built out every day. Aragon began as a dream to increase the iteration rate of governance and we can clearly see that happening today.

Web3 aims to do what the internet has failed to do until this point: promote open services powered by decentralized protocols instead of centralized applications controlled by tech behemoths. Web3 can be seen as the “read/write/own” version of the internet — users can link programs and content directly, bypassing central intermediaries. Open services built on Web3 promote permissionless entry, optimize value and guarantee verifiability. These services are far more resilient, fair and ethical. Rather than accessing tech platforms in exchange for monthly fees and personal data, users participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. Participants are true network stakeholders rather than just customers or products exploited by economic pressures. In this environment, tokens or cryptocurrencies represent accessibility, governance and ownership of decentralized networks. Whereas in Web2 you are the product, in Web3 you are the owner. Charitable organizations are a prime example of businesses that stand to benefit greatly from the DAO structure. Often, the amount of money and time that is spent on administrative tasks and decisions on fund allocations surpasses the amount of time spent completing charitable activities. Through DAO implementations, funds can be distributed to the proper channels quickly and effectively. The result: charities unlocking higher impact of their end causes.

DAOs can also serve as a direct avenue for investments and the accelerated adoption of DeFi (decentralized finance). DAOs utilizing cryptocurrencies allow for low costs and near-instantaneous peer-to-peer transactions that are not subject to stipulations of traditional finance institutions. Through lending or transaction fees, members are able to generate better returns compared to those they would receive if they had held assets in a traditional financial institution. This space is rapidly growing with no signs of any slowdown in the near future.

With this generation’s heavy focus on social media and content creation, NFTs and the adoption of DAOs to purchase and store these digital assets further enable the creator economy. Creators directly benefit from their works of art since the value of their product is tied to their brand, fan base and organization.
