# **“History and achievements of DAOs”**

Do you really want to dive into the world of DAO? Then I will lead you by the hand into this beautiful, new world. A world where our future lies. Cryptocurrency, DAO, NFT, that’s all there is now and what will accompany us in the coming decades. And the sooner you figure it all out, the better off you’ll be. Don’t be left on the sidelines of history. Take action! Welcome to the world of DAO.

Let’s get this straight, what is DAO? DAO stands for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation. This system is based on a blockchain and is controlled by a special digital code, and the code works in such a way that it does not need any external assistance.

The key feature of the operation is that there is no main node controlling the whole system, without discussion with the other participants. There is no hierarchy in such projects. Each user has absolutely equal rights, and each of them is able to vote for this or that change equally with the others.

In essence, DAO is a kind of online community, a club or organisation, the key to get into which is a token. It’s like replacing a secret handshake, said Wired author Gilad Edelman, who created his own DAO, lmaoDAO, dedicated to coming up with funny captions for cartoons in The New Yorker magazine (like Wired, part of Condé Nast Publishing).

Many DAOs are simply groups on the Discord messenger, in which a user needs a certain token to join. In other words, only a user who has a cryptocurrency wallet can become a member of a DAO. Edelman also refers to DAO as blockchain-based crowdfunding, which uses cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currencies — the same tokens that need to be purchased to become part of a particular community.

The most famous example of the technology functioning is The DAO, which was launched in 2016 by German startup Slock.it as a new model of corporate finance and governance. It was created as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which by then was only a year old. The DAO raised more than $160 million (ETH 12.7 million) from about 20,000 people. The investors of the project were going to collectively vote with DAO tokens (they were given in exchange for ETH) where to spend the money. It was supposed to be invested in new startups, whose ideas anyone could come up with: if the startups were successful, The DAO investors would get their share in them; if they failed, the money would simply be “written off”.

Nevertheless, the experiment failed — hackers stole 3.6 million ETH due to a vulnerability in the smart contract, and the creators had to “roll back” Ethereum to a time when The DAO did not yet exist. There is still Ethereum classic, a version of the currency that is being developed by those who disagreed with the rollback of the blockchain in 2016. ETH classic has a capitalisation of $5.4bn compared to ETH’s $388bn.

Hundreds of DAOs have since emerged, many of which have become successful and transcended the crypto-world. All DAOs have a capitalisation of $10 billion, with eight projects’ tokens already included in the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Last year, Jenny DAO bought the rights to DJ Steve Aoki’s NFT track for $1 million. The organization’s charter allows for an equal split of revenue from the sale of the work. Investors have invested $7m in the organisation.

Another DAO, Metafactory, creates craft clothing brands: any designer can send them their sketches and, if successful on the ballot, receive money for production, which begins with the creation of digital clothing. These are sold as NFT tokens, with the added bonus of the real thing. The company said it wants to bridge the real and virtual worlds. Their DAO allows aspiring designers to become popular without touching the complexities and downsides of the fashion industry.

Also a breakthrough in video platforms is DAO Joystream. In this project, the founders believe that media platforms have an obligation to be accountable to the people they impact, whether it be their end users, content creators, third-party developers or in-house employees. Joystream’s main thesis is that two main challenges need to be addressed to achieve this goal, and the path to getting them right is the use of modern distributed systems technology, including blockchain, as well as smart contracts and tokens. For this reason, there must be a complete break with the organisational structure in favour of joining an alternative or creating your own alternative. The effectiveness of this approach depends on comparing the cost of disengagement with the cost of joining an alternative or creating your own alternative. To date, the cost of leaving platforms has been very high.

Creating platforms based on open source, protocols and public data, as in the case of blockchain-based systems, can dramatically reduce this cost. Because users control their own information, account and assets, they can easily join a new platform, even taking all their friends with them.

Open protocols and the availability of open data will lead to the development of opportunities to participate in several platforms simultaneously without even switching between them, which will facilitate competition at the platform level .

Moreover, the use of open source implies that all platform developments can easily be reused, and since the entire organisational structure and its state is public, an entire ecosystem can be cloned and an alternative platform with alternative goals and policies can be created.
