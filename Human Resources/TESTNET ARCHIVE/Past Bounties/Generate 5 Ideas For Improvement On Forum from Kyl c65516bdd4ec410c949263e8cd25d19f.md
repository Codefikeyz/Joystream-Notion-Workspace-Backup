# **Improvement On Forum**

What’s Forum?

Forum channels provide a space for organized discussions. With forums, you can discuss specific topics and not worry about talking over each other. Since discussions are contained in posts, it’s easier to jump in on an existing one or start a new one without worrying about your message getting buried.

The following are the improved features on forum discord channels.

1. Firing of inactive members and hiring of new members into the working groups

2. Increased pay to the member of the working groups in order facilitate the effectiveness of the group.

3. Segregation, abuse and harassment of members is strictly prohibited.

4. Scamming, spamming are outlawed activities in the forum which helps to increase security of members.

5. A detailed investigation into reasons why bounties are moved elsewhere.
