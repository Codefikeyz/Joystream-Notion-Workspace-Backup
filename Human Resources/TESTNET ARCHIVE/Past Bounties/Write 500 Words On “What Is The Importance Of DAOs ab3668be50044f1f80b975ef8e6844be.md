# **What is the importance of DAOs?**

Today I would like to talk about DAOs, and more specifically about their importance in the world of the future. But before revealing the topic of this article, let’s figure out what DAO itself is.What is DAO?

Following the example of Uniswap, TheDao and Joystream already known all over the world, If we parse the abbreviation, we get the following:

D — DecentralizedA — AutonomousO — Organization

By the way, an interesting fact, the word DAO in Chinese means “way” “road” “path”. But back to our DAO of the 21st century. In fact, this is the same organization that exists in the world, OJSC or LLC, the only significant difference is that it is autonomous. What does it mean? In simple words, it can exist on its own, like an application that runs on a server, and it is also completely independent of human intervention, including even the organizers themselves.

DAO — is a program code, a smart contract, which is based on a set of rules while this code works on the blockchain.

# **Background of DAOs**

The first thing you need before reflecting on the top DAO benefits is a clear understanding of what a DAO actually is. Take note of the fact that even if DAOs have turned out on almost every crypto discussion forum in recent times, they have been around since 2016. The design of the first-ever DAO showcases an overview of the definition of decentralized autonomous organizations. Developed as an automated and decentralized organization, the first-ever DAO worked as a venture capital fund.

However, the organization did not have headquarters in any posh locality or a board of directors. On the contrary, the DAO was developed on the basis of open-source code without the conventional centralized management structures. Why build a DAO in the first place? While the pros of DAO can set clear reasons for using them now, what could have inspired the first-ever DAO?

**Let’s analyze the topic of the article using the example of one of the most successful DAO — Joystream**

## **So what is the importance?**

We understood what DAO is, but why is it needed, because everything works fine anyway, you might say. The term DAO says a lot about the reasons it came into being. The “decentralized” and “autonomous” DAOs are not linked to any country in order to ensure complete decentralization. In essence, the developers of the first DAO sought to transfer decision-making power to members of an organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

But in this article, I would like to focus on the most important thing that the DAO influences. Namely, problems called the “principal-agent” dilemma. We will devote a separate paragraph to it.

## **Principal-agent Problem**

The dilemma is that when an individual or legal entity (agent) is given the opportunity to make a decision or act on behalf of another legal entity (principal), there is a risk of divergent goals, priorities, access to important information, and, of course, a conflict of interest.

A striking example is politics, we vote for deputies to whom we delegate our powers to make further decisions for us in the management of the state apparatus. As we all well know, the interests of deputies often diverge from the interests of voters.

In turn, in the DAO, in order to perform any action related to the spending of funds or the adoption of important decisions, an open vote of the DAO participants takes place on the blockchain, and the distribution occurs automatically using a smart contract, without the participation of people.
