# **History and Achievement of DAO’s**

Decentralized autonomous organizations(DAO’s) such as Joystream are entities that operate through smart contracts. Its financial transactions and rules are encoded on a blockchain, effectively removing the need for a central governing authority — hence the descriptors “decentralized” and “autonomous.”

DAOs are created when a person or group creates a new smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain and distributes it to others. The code defines how funds are raised, how voting works, what happens if someone wants to leave the DAO, and other important details. Anyone can create a DAO, but there is no guarantee that other people will join or buy into it. If the DAO is successful and popular, then smart contract owners can earn rewards in the form of Ether for their work on behalf of the DAO.

At the beginning of May 2016, a few members of the Ethereum community announced the inception of The DAO, which was also known as Genesis DAO. It was built as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The coding framework was developed open source by the Slock team but it was deployed under “The DAO” name by members of the Ethereum community. The DAO had a creation period during which anyone was allowed to send Ether to a unique wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens on a 1–100 scale. In essence, the platform would allow anyone with a project to pitch their idea to the community and potentially receive funding from The DAO. Anyone with DAO tokens could vote on plans, and would then receive rewards if the projects turned a profit.

However, on June 17, 2016, a hacker found a loophole in the coding that allowed him to drain funds from The DAO. In the first few hours of the attack, 3.6 million ETH were stolen, the equivalent of $70 million at the time. Once the hacker had done the damage he intended, he withdrew the attack.

In this exploit, the attacker was able to “ask” the smart contract (DAO) to give the Ether back multiple times before the smart contract could update its balance.

**Achievements of DAO’s**

1.) One of the biggest achievements of DAO’s is that they’ve created a more efficent and secure way of making transactions , there are no middlemen or third parties involved in transactions between members and customers thus making transactions more secure.

2.) DAO’s such as Joystream has also provide improved transparency through their use of open-source software, which allows anyone with internet access to view all transactions made within an organization at any time. This makes it easier for people to see how their money is being spent and where funds are going.

3.) DAO’s have also achieved a lower cost structure due to the fact that they do not require employees or other overhead expenses such as office space, utilities, and so forth.

4.) Finally, decentralized autonomous organizations like Joystream are less vulnerable to hacking attacks because they don’t have a central point of failure. If one part of the network goes down, then others will still be able to operate as usual with no interruption in service for users or customers who rely on them for their business needs and transactions.
