ARTICLE ON CURRENT STATE OF JOYSTREAM DAO.

While Jsgenesis is the team currently building the technology behind the Joystream project, which will not be around forever, and hence, the Discord Joystream community entrusting the future operation of the Joystream DAO to our community members.

Now, the Discord Joystream community has launched a program formally know as FOUNDING MEMBER PROGRAM (FMP) to allocate tokens among some of their highest quality community members in recognition of their contributions to the project and ensures that a sufficiently large, effective and motivated community of users is ready to occupy all the different roles required to run, evolve and grow the platform on mainnet.

This Joystream Founding Member Program was formally launched on 12th February 2021. To be formally admitted to the program you will be contacted and screened by a Jsgenesis representative once your community contributions have met our internally determined threshold for admission. The program is intended to run at least until the platform is ready to go live on mainnet, possibly even after.

However, before this mainnet launches the Discord Joystream Server is about to launch the final testnet known as Carthage, this will be the final testnet before the mainnet go live.

Now everybody in the Discord Joystream Server, want to qualify to become an FM, for the reason that only the FM are eligible to work and receive all tokens after the mainnet is launched, but if you have not reached to status of an FM, it is bound that the non-FM’s tokens might become worthless.

Conjunctionally, the Discord Joystream Atlas program will also go live, there are multiple gateways that are attached to this program such as content creator and content curator, where you can post videos NFTs and have them minted and also have them auctioned, and sell these NFTs.

It is also known that when the mainnet launches, 1million of native ktjoy token will be approximated to $20,000, if the market stability remains the same, otherwise it is bound to the dynamics of the market.
