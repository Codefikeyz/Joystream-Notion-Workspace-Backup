# **History And Achievements Of DAOs**

**When DAO was launched?**

The DAO launched in late **April 2016** thanks to a month-long crowd sale of tokens that raised more than **$150 million in funds**. 3 At the time, the launch was the largest crowdfunding fundraising campaign of all time.

**What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?**

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

After a year-long crypto bull market, millions of new people introduced to crypto, and thousands of projects launched and generating fees — let’s just say things are different today:

We currently measure DAO stakes in millions. It doesn’t stop here — the widespread crypto protocols that have been created in the last year control huge hoards of native tokens, sometimes reaching billions in value of these assets. An example of this is Uniswap, a hugely successful protocol that enables decentralized permissionless asset trading on Ethereum. Their treasury? Approximately 7,200,000,000 US dollars; or more than seven billion dollars mostly in UNI tokens. (we can check this amount together with the movements in the cash register whenever we want; the data is completely transparent and can be requested by anyone!)

# **The new properties of organizations built as a DAO**

A lot of DAOs implement a function in their smart contracts called ragequit. This function serves simply to let any DAO member call it, and immediately remove themselves from the DAO, receiving their pro rata assortment of assets. This is remarkable in a number of ways! Let’s think of a real-world example where a partnership agreement specifies in writing how a member could leave and take their share of money out of the company. Traditionally, if all goes well, paperwork is signed, and in a few days, all is well and on its way. Some of the assets might be hard to liquidate or split up, but it’ll get sorted. In another scenario where there is a dispute on the terms, lawyers involved and all, leaving a partnership might take months and be very expensive! The ragequit function is agnostic to all this. The second it’s called, assets are transferred according to the rules, no papers are signed, no one even has to check! This can all happen within a few seconds. Most importantly, it’s agnostic to how anyone feels. An unruly member can’t get in the way.

# **Benefits of DAOs**

There are several reasons why an entity or collective group of individuals may want to pursue a DAO structure. Some of the benefits of this form of management include:

- **Decentralization**. Decisions impacting the organization are made by a collection of individuals as opposed to a central authority that is often vastly outnumbered by their peers. Instead of relying on the actions of one individual (CEO) or a small collection of individuals ([Board of Directors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp)), a DAO can decentralize authority across a vastly larger range of users.
- **Participation.** Individuals within an entity may feel more empowered and connected to the entity when they have a direct say and voting power on all matters. These individuals may not have strong voting power, but a DAO encourages token holders to cast votes, burn tokens, or use their tokens in ways they think is best for the entity.
- **Publicity.** Within a DAO, votes are cast via blockchain and made publicly viewable. This requires users to act in ways they feel is best, as their vote and their decisions will be made publicly viewable. This incentivizes actions that will benefit voters’ reputations and discourage acts against the community.
- **Community.** The concept of a DAO encourages people from all over the world to seamlessly come together to build a single vision. With just an internet connection, tokenholders can interact with other owners wherever they may live.
