# **What are the issues of DAOs?**

Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and delivers food, but also uses that money to order products. This machine also buys cleaning services and pays its own rent. In fact, as you put money into the machine, you and other users have a say in what the machine will order and how often it will be cleaned. It has no manager, all these operations are written in its code.

That’s more or less how the Decentralized Autonomous Organization called DAO works. The idea of such a governance model has been circulating in the cryptocurrency community ever since Bitcoin removed the middleman in financial transactions. Similarly, the main idea of the DAO is to establish a company or organization that can function without hierarchical management.

It is important to distinguish between DAO as an organization type and “The DAO” as the name of such an organisation. The project was one of the first attempts to create a DAO and failed before it even started due to a bug in its code.

**How and why to become a DAO shareholder?**

Investing in a DAO is pretty easy, especially if you know how to buy Ether or Bitcoin and have a wallet. All you have to do is buy the tokens of a DAO, which is like buying shares of a company.

Once the funding process is over, you’ll be able to submit proposals, vote on proposals, and maybe even make a profit. The amount of tokens you receive will be proportional to the voting power you will have.

However, before you invest, know where you are investing your money. DAOs are completely transparent and their code is open-source, so you can look it up yourself to make sure there are no issues or errors.

**Disadvantages and Criticism**

DAOs, like everything related to cryptocurrencies, are a fairly new, even somewhat revolutionary technology. Naturally, such projects are the focus of criticism. For example, entrusting important financial decisions to the masses is a bad idea and unprofitable, according to the MIT Technology Review. In their article, they say a lot must change in the world for DAO projects to be successful.

There are other concerns with DAOs, aside from the highly controversial view that ‘the masses cannot be trusted to invest’. The most prominent problem, especially after The DAO incident, is a security problem related to the ‘unstoppable code’ principle. During the attack, investors and observers watched helplessly as funds were siphoned off The DAO, as it technically followed offensive rules. Of course, such incidents can be avoided if the code is well-written and error-free.

First, DAOs can be less efficient than traditional organizations. Since decision making in a DAO is based on consensus, decisions may take longer to be made. This can delay the completion of tasks and reduce the productivity of the organization.

Second, DAOs may be more susceptible to fraud and hacking than traditional organizations. Because a DAO is decentralized, no central authority is responsible for security. If hackers can gain access to the organization’s computer systems, they can steal funds or user data.

Third, DAOs may be less democratic than traditional organizations. In a DAO, all members have an equal say in making decisions that may result in decisions that do not reflect the preferences of all members.

Fourth, DAOs may be less able to adapt to changing circumstances than traditional organizations. Because a DAO is decentralized, it does not have a central mandate to respond quickly to changing conditions. This can limit the organization’s ability to respond to new challenges and opportunities.

Finally, DAOs may be less likely to survive than traditional organizations. Since a DAO is decentralized, it may cease to exist if any member leaves the organization. This may limit the organization’s ability to continue operating over the long term.

An additional concern shared by those who are not natural proponents of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is that communities cannot make the best management decisions for an organization. However, this cannot go beyond personal belief to a large extent.

Finally, the main concern with DAOs is the lack of a clear regulatory structure. Most governments around the world have not clearly defined their legal view of DAOs. This may hinder the rapid development of organizations.

Since joy stream is also a DAO, all these risks also apply to joy stream without distinguishing one community from another. Never forget to do your own research before investing money in projects.

Me? yes, I did my own research and I would like to state that Joy stream is my favorite project among crypto platforms.
