# **Transformation of DAOs**

Transformation of DAO

We are still in the early innings of this revolution in DAO infrastructure. Ideas regarding DAOs and their governance mechanisms have been around for quite a while, yet we are just beginning to experience the proliferation of these organizations. Alongside the growth of technically-oriented DAOs, we have lately experienced the rise of a different, socially-oriented approach to them.

Even though there is no hard line that separates these two segments, as DAOs exist on a spectrum of decentralization and autonomy, socially-oriented DAOs primarily exist to bring people together, find new ways for them to interact, assemble and collaborate.

Examples of these types of DAOs include collectives and pseudo-anonymous groups that manage funds, share their passion for artists and NFTs (JoystreamDAO, PleasrDAO & FlamingoDAO), or even create media, social, and culture DAOs (BanklessDAO & FWB).

In this sense, it can be claimed that contemporary DAOs are communities of people who decide to align their ideas, values, and vision, and devote their time to creating organizations that are based on the core values of the blockchain world (openness, transparency, and decentralization).

As mentioned above, DAOs represent a shift from traditional companies in that they can be global and geographically decentralized from the start, permissionless in their access and contribution, and able to minimize frictions around employment, contracts, and identity.

While everything looks like we are moving towards a new era in regards to the structure, the functionality, and the products of a modern DAO, there is one thing we can say for sure- the types of social coordination, the degree of innovation, the flourishing of creativity, and the new ways of relating to one another that the DAOs have unlocked, is here to stay and will revolutionize our world!.

**How to Start a DAO**

 Create a Mission Statement and Define Goals

 Build a Community

 Use Your Community Tools

 Establish Funding Goals

 Discover Governance

 Determine Ownership

Starting a business can be so rewarding with the right amount of know-how and dedication. Which type of business entity you go with will determine how it’s run and how you’ll make money. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a relatively new model that’s attracting a lot of attention. If you’ve never heard of this type of business entity, then let’s go over it and discuss how to set one up.

A DAO allows groups of people with similar interests (businesses, non-profits, etc.) to operate their organization without a hierarchal authority figure and, instead, through decentralized governance. The DAO’s members can cooperate and run the entity

with full transparency.

The organization’s rules are encoded into a transparent computer program and members can control the code without the worry of outsiders influencing it. This freedom sets DAOs apart from traditional organizations and makes them an attractive model to make a profit.

**How to Launch and Run a DAO**

DAOs are nothing like traditional organizations. They run on a unique model that may sound a bit far-fetched, but many DAOs currently operate and are making profits.

**Step 1: Create a Mission Statement and Define Goals**

As with any business type, you’ll first have to draft a mission statement. This is arguably the most important step in the process since this is where you’ll establish how the DAO will be run and what its goals are. It’s almost like a business plan you’d see in more traditional business entities.This is the

perfect opportunity to be as transparent as possible.

**Be Specific**

The great thing about a mission statement is that you can draft it however you want and include whatever you’d like. Make sure the DAO’s goals are realistic and achievable given the resources at your disposal. Also be sure to specifically detail how the members should act and what should be done if changes to the DAO are ever needed down the road.

**Step 2: Build a Community**

Building a DAO’s community may be the hardest step in the process. You’ll first need to decide if your DAO will be large or small and open to the public or exclusive. Your mission statement in the first step will also have to address this.The following communities exist in the joystreamDAO:

ScaryTeacher, Sport War, Rotten Egg etc.

**Choosing Members**

If you’re looking to build your DAO to have

thousands of members, then you’ll need to put in some serious work to grow the community. On the other hand, if your DAO aims to have a membership that extends to only a specific number of people or audience with a specific interest, then you’ll need to limit who joins.

Building a communication hub to attract people interested in decentralized organizations is where the hard work comes in. There are plenty of community channels out there where you can attract this crowd, like social media groups or even chat platforms like Discord.

**Open Communication**

Having open communication with members is vital for the DAO. Remember, DAOs have no managerial hierarchy, meaning that its members will have to be open with each other in order to make the organization work. You can also use different platforms to keep in touch with your members, which takes us to our next point.

**Step 3: Use Your Community Tools**

Going off of what we mentioned earlier about finding potential community members, use tools to keep in touch with them about DAO-related duties, like voting or talking about changes to the organization.

Chatting services like Discord and Telegram are great ways to safeguard your DAO’s duties. Forums can also offer a great form of communication.

Discord, for example, gives server owners the ability to restrict who joins the server, potentially eliminating the risk of having outside parties know what your DAO is up to, especially if it’s one that has membership stipulations.

**Step 4: Establish Funding Goals**

The DAO’s treasury is what really makes the organization valuable. This part of the DAO allows the community to use capital to achieve its mission. It’s important to really take the time and establish how the organization’s treasury will be structured. As mentioned above, the ScaryTeacher platform creates a mean of rewarding their members for participating in some events like the RUMBLE Royal game, Scary- Gartic etc.

**Structuring the Treasury**

The treasury’s structure depends on the type of DAO. For example, if your DAO has a fee for usage, then you can put this money into the treasury. DAOs that sell membership access through other means, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), work the same way.

**Purchasing Tokens**

Individuals or entities looking to join the DAO can purchase the organization’s native token, which is a form of digital currency. Members with tokens can be given voting rights that are proportional to their holdings. They can also own equity in the organization to shape its future.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you should put as much capital into your treasury as possible since this empowers the organization’s community. This brings us to our next step.

**Step 5: Discover Governance**

Members of DAOs will need to chime in on discussions

and proposals that can affect the DAO’s growth. Changes and actions will need to be voted on in order for the organization to move forward. Let’s take a closer look at how these organizations are governed.

**Formal Governance**

Formal governance falls into two categories: off-chain and on-chain. Off-chain governance involves discussions that eventually lead to formal governance voting. On-chain governance involves token votes.

A DAO’s typical governance flow involves:

 Discussions about organization-related matters through chatting and video calls.

 Reaching a soft consensus through forum proposals.

 Reaching a hard consensus through a token vote.

 Executing proposals if they’re passed.

**Delegated Governance**

DAOs can also practice delegated governance. The community grants certain rights to a group of individuals or working groups. When these groups should step in is crucial. The last thing you and your community will want is to go through a formal governance process that can last weeks just to make a single decision.

Working groups with specific powers can allow the organization to move forward at a faster pace while also allowing the community to have its say in matters.

**Step 6: Determine Ownership**

Distributing ownership in a DAO is how you allow members to vote on decisions and represent membership access. Two ways to distribute ownership are with NFTs and fungible tokens (ERC-20 token). Some DAOs use NFTs as governance weight while others uses ERC-20s. Both have advantages and disadvantages that vary depending on the type of DAO you have and how it operates.
