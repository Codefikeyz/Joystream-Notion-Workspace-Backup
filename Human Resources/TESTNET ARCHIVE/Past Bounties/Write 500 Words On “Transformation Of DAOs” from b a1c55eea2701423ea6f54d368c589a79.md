# **Transformation Of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*LEccc88uT-mvHEv-.jpg)

DeFi emerged from the desire among the blockchain community to create an open, permissionless, decentralized financial system. As such, DAOs offered an attractive way for projects to demonstrate their commitment to decentralization through community governance.

As a result, during 2020, when DeFi began to gain rapid ground, governance tokens became vastly popular. Flagship DeFi apps including Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) launched tokens allowing users to participate in decentralized governance, while newcomer DeFi projects have taken to launching their governance tokens from the start.

So why are DAOs now making such a splash even among mainstream news outlets? Part of the reason is the surge in popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which are set to play a more significant role in DAO governance and who gets to participate.

Another emerging trend is investment DAOs, as some believe that DAOs are set to disrupt the traditional VC model of funding entirely. These DAOs are allowing groups of Web3 natives to pool and deploy capital in such a way that now allows individuals to compete with traditional finance entities.

In addition, many tools have recently appeared to ensure the functioning of the DAO (Colony, Snapshot, Tally, Syndicate, Coinshift, and others), which undoubtedly make the life of the DAO easier and more convenient.

I think that today's DAOs are still at an **early stage,** we are waiting for a long path of their evolution, undergoing which DAOs will become **truly DAOs** in the broadest sense of the word.

“In the future, it’s likely that the average person will not work for a company,” [Ben Schecter](https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-work-daos-crypto-networks/), who works at crypto platform RabbitHole, writes at *Future a16z*. “Instead, people will earn income in non-traditional ways by taking actions such as playing games, learning new skills, creating art, or curating content.”

If that sounds like the sort of post-capitalist utopia that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels dreamed of in the 1840s — well that’s intentional.

That’s because Schecter’s vision of the future of work is being built on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These are a set of crypto protocols which are emerging as new ways of coordinating, measuring, and rewarding contributions.

“The idea that most people would be employed by large corporations would have seemed crazy to someone in the year 1800,” he says. “This shift is already beginning to unlock new earning potential for individuals, and it is leading toward a growing transfer of value capture from organizations to people participating as individuals in crypto networks.”

It would be interesting to see how far the DAOs can go in the future!

There are no easy answers to many questions, but now that crypto, NFTs and DeFi have found a foothold to reach the mainstream consciousness, it seems natural that DAOs will follow. Furthermore, as they become more mainstream, it should become easier to identify smother means by which communities can decentralize governance.

If you are interested in DAOs I would recommend you check one interesting DAO. It is Joystream DAO ([https://www.joystream.org/](https://www.joystream.org/)) — the streaming platform (but not only this!) owned by community.
