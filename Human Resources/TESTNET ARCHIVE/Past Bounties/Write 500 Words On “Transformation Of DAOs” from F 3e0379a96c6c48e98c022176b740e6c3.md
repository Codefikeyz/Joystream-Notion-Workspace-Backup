# **Transformation Of DAOs**

In order to cover the topic of transformation of the DAOs , it is necessary to answer the question of what these organisations are. A DAO is a decentralised, autonomous organisation that is governed by smart contracts. Smart contracts are responsible for voting, financial management and workflow functions.

Dan Larimer, the founder of EOS, came up with the concept of DAO itself. He theorised this new concept to the world. And Vitalik Buterin, in turn, developed this idea further. He took a risk and created the DAO project with the token name of the same name and raised over $150mn to launch this project. It was the biggest crowdfunding project ever. But, as always, crooks don’t sleep and managed to steal most of the amount, thus damaging the reputation of the whole idea of DAO for years to come.

But in the cryptocurrency world everyone is used to things often going wrong. Crypto-enthusiasts didn’t stop there and developed the DAO theme further. And at the moment, all the DAOs can be divided into eight different groups:

Infrastructural (Aragon, Colony, DAOhaus);

Protocol (Uniswap, MakerDao, Copmound);

Service (LexDAO, Kleros, VectorDAO, GovernorDAO);

Social (BrightMoments, FiatLuxDAO, KrauseHaus);

Investment (CSPDao, The Lao, Flamingo);

Grants (Audius Grants, MolochDAO, MintFund, UkraineDao);

Collector communities (APEDao, HerstoryDAO, PartyDao );

media (BanklessDAO, Mirror, Joystream).

Infrastructural DAOs

These organizations allow people to create their own DAOs. They offer templates, frameworks, off-the-shelf smart contracts and APIs that simplify the operational process in blockchain.

In other words, even users with limited technical skills can set up a decentralised community thanks to such projects.

There are more than 20 infrastructure DBAs on the market, offering various solutions for organising communities in different networks. Among the brightest representatives of the segment:

Aragon, an open-source project offering a range of solutions for creating and managing DAOs based on Ethereum, Polygon, Metis Andromeda or Harmony;

Colony is a blockchain platform that runs exclusively on the Ethereum network. Its set of smart contracts is designed for groups of people to work together — it enforces certain rules without a hierarchical structure;

DAOhaus — a kind of browser for decentralized organizations that allows joining existing communities and creating own ones based on Moloch framework. The project works on networks ranging from Polygon to Ethereum and related L2 solutions.

Protocol DAOs

The main goal of protocol DAOs is to put the management of the project into the hands of the community. Organisations issue digital tokens whose holders can propose, vote and make changes to the mechanics of the protocol.

Such entities typically introduce different models of liquidity mining and revenue farming in order to attract new users and increase decentralisation.

Protocol MAOs include, among others:

Uniswap is the largest decentralised exchange based on an automated market maker mechanism. The project is driven by UNI control token holders.

MakerDAO is a DeFi platform based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows the issuance of DAI Stablecoin against digital assets. The control token here is MKR, which also participates in DAI’s sustainability mechanism.

Compound is a decentralised lending protocol in which interest rates are generated algorithmically based on supply and demand. It is also based on the Ethereum network.

Service DAIs

As mentioned above, decentralised organisations manage assets with a combined value of $10bn and represent a significant sector of the cryptocurrency industry. Service MAOs are a B2B segment of the market. They provide other distributed communities with services within their purview.

In some jurisdictions, MAOs can obtain legal personality; in others, they need an affiliated classical structure to interact with traditional companies and partners. This creates a demand for specialist legal services.

In most cases, VAOs accept proposals under which these issues are handled by legal advisors. However, in some cases, the legal aspect can be provided by smart contracts.

Distributed organisations like LexDAO offer tools that DAOs can use instead of expensive and often unaffordable legal services.

In addition, there is a growing segment of “decentralised courts”. If a dispute arises between two MAOs, they can use a platform like Kleros, which is a kind of arbitration service. Conflicts within the organisation can also be resolved in a similar way.

There are many more varieties of service DAOs, from outsourcing services (VectorDAO) to delegating project management (Governor DAO).

Social DAO

Social DAOs can be considered a product of the evolution of forums and group chats. First of all, such communities focus on the social interaction of people and therefore can be created around their common hobby.

For example, the Bright Moments project is an NFT art gallery organised as a DAO. To join the community, the user needs to purchase a non-exchangeable token from the Crypto Citizens collection.

FiatLuxDAO is an alumni community at the University of California, Berkeley. DAO focuses on funding scientific and technological innovation.

KrausHaus — an association of basketball fans who decided to create a DAO to fundraise, buy and manage an NBA league team.

Investment DAOs

The first representative of this group was the aforementioned The DAO. Such organisations focus on generating profits — their members pool capital, knowledge and expertise to form an investment portfolio in line with common goals.

Such DAOs can fund decentralised projects in the early stages of development or invest in digital tokens.

CSP DAOs target development teams that use blockchain technology. The structure is managed through NEBO tokens, which are also responsible for the distribution of investment shares.

Grant DAOs

As in the previous case, participants in such organisations pool capital to achieve common goals, but do not aim to maximise profits.

In most cases, they are “distributed” grants that focus on sustaining the ecosystem of a particular protocol:

Audius Grants provides funding for projects and initiatives in the Audis ecosystem;

MolochDAO, a community whose members fund the development of EIP.

However, there are other examples — the Mint Fund grantees are digital artists interested in creating NFT. The DAO subsidises the costs of issuing tokens (gas commission) as well as providing consultancy and other support.

Charities like the Ukraine DAO can also be included in this group.

DAO collectors.

The rapid development of the NFT segment and the growing value of digital works of art led to the appearance of decentralized organizations aimed at collecting non-exchangeable tokens. The members of such FAOs usually own a share in the community’s treasury.

Some DAOs focus on specific collections. For example, an APE DAO supports the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem. Others select collectibles based on different principles — herstoryDAO acquires digital works by black women.

There are also organisations that buy NFTs in order to shard them and then fractionally own them. PartyDAO is an example of such entities.

Standing apart are DAOs that are set up to acquire physical items or fund some community initiative. For example, in February 2022 AssangeDAO raised more than $32 million to help facilitate the release from prison of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

MediaDAO

The purpose of the decentralized organizations in this group is to disseminate news and other information.

Some media-DAOs resemble community-driven traditional media. For example, BANK token holders of Bankless have the right to submit various proposals and initiatives to a vote, as well as to be content creators, subject to proof of appropriate skills.

Organisations like Mirror are community-owned blogging platforms. They allow authors to publish content and monetise content.

Another member of the group, Global Coin Research, is a hybrid community of authors and investors focused on the Web 3.0 industry. GCR token holders gain access to a co-investment platform and unique analytical content. Creators of the latter earn tokens for writing content.

Joystream is a video platform that is controlled, owned and operated by its users. According to PolkaProject, Joystream is a decentralised organisation (DAO) running on its own blockchain based on the Substrate framework. Joystream offers a modern and experimental solution to the problem of digital media management. The project aims to create a user-driven video platform with a strong sense of community and freedom.
