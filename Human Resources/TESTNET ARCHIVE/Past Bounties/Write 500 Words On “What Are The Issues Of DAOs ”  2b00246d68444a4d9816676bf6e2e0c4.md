# **ISSUES OF DAOs**

First came the creation of cryptocurrencies. Since no one wants to accept BTC or ETH for a loaf of bread, NFTs were created. The COVID pandemic having led to a loneliness crisis, NFTs helped foster online communities, that grew, evolved, and came to need organization. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are the logical next step. DAOs are how humans come together as a group to make decisions in the digital world. They do so with the help of two key tools. Firstly, the rules that govern the organization are expressed as a series of digital “IF/THEN” statements, that are then coded directly into a blockchain (thus rendering them both auditable and permanent). Secondly, voting shares are issued to stakeholders in the form of “digital governance tokens” — also recorded on a blockchain. Doing things this way replaces, in theory, both the legal mumbo-jumbo of today’s organizations (rules are coded) and their hierarchical nature (everyone has a voice).

**1. In DAOs, your pay is decided by your peers**

DAOs are trying to innovate on the way people get paid. Having one entity (the market, a team, a committee, leadership…) decide on salary would be centralization, and thus unacceptable for the crypto crowd. There are interesting ideas being tested instead, but the way communities are doing it highlights the privilege of the people working on decentralized projects.

Today, pay revolves around a set of key questions. Should salaries be market-based? Role-based? Value-based? Employment-based? Ethics-based? Are they guaranteed? Localized? Negotiable? Secret or transparent? Singular, variable, tiered? Annually adjusted? market-adjusted? Are raises possible? If so, should they be tenure or experience-driven? Linked to performance? Inflation? DAOs fail to answer most of these questions.

**2. In DAOs, decisions are reached by vote**

Tokens given to DAO stakeholders for services rendered have 2 functions. They act as valuable shares which can be traded, and as ballots to make decisions within the organization. I just described the concept of a public company’s shares, but don’t tell the Web3 crowd; they get upset.

Proposals are usually made along the lines of “should we invest in G or J”, “should we build on blockchain B or E”, “should we let person Y participate”… A majority is generally needed for a proposal to pass. Those who own the most tokens have a louder voice, as DAOs tend to use a “1 token = 1 vote” system instead of a “1 man = 1 vote” one. In principle, this means people who own the most tokens stand a chance of losing more due to poor governance decisions, and are thus more engaged. In practice, I think this is just a way for founders to keep control.

**3. DAOs have no HR, Health Insurance or legal status**

DAOs are new concepts, with a blurry legal status in most countries in which they operate. They also do away with well-defined roles, preferring the idea of “emergence” to that of a job description. These two facts ensure that a large part of society is unable to participate in DAOs (too risky). This leads to a handful of externalities.

- Without the equivalent of Human Resources, the organization lacks arbiters. Conflict may thus thrive, and factions can easily be formed. This is why DAOs struggle to reach a large number of people, on top of the topics mentioned above. The trust and transparency needed to work together can only happen when peers have the same value system. In comparison, a corporation doesn’t need trust. It has contracts.

**4. DAOs force absolute transparency**

I’m sure having an organization’s decisions and work recorded on blockchains for all to see has loads of advantages (?). But I can also see two immediate downsides to pursuing transparency at all costs.

Firstly, linking a wallet to a DAO means that anyone and everyone can see every transaction made with that wallet. Put another way: imagine if all your co-workers could see every transaction going in and out of your bank account because that is also the one your company sends your salaries to. This would lead to chaos. One could solve this by having different wallets, but that seems like a hassle we don’t have today.

Secondly, and more importantly, the nature of DAOs means that their stakeholders are vulnerable to off-chain coercion. Crypto proponents are primed for scams. They often showcase poor judgment, low social literacy (if my DMs are anything to go by), high tolerance for risks, and are highly persuadable.

I believe that DAOs have a future, as they allow us to experiment with new concepts that are sorely needed if we are to save capitalism. We need to learn from them and from the people that aim to build them.
