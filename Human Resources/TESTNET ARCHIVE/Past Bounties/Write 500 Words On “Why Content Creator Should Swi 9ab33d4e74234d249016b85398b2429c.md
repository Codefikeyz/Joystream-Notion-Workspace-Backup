# **Why Should Content Creators Switch To Atlas**

A key principle that I think we have to really think about, is, I would say the shift from automation to autonomy. There’s been a lot of discussion about the power of automation, robotic process automation.It seems like magic, doesn’t it?You know, you can take software and you can replace people and processes and really cut costs and get greater levels of efficiency. But there’s a more interesting trend beginning. Which is the rise of autonomous organizations.

Have you ever wanted to buy the United States constitution? Or what about a fast food franchise? Exactly those items were attempted or purchased by a new type of organization known as a DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organization. Think of it as kind of an internet community with a shared bank account.

The [**Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/)** it serve as a base template for others to build their own product offerings on top of Joystream. This innovation is uniquely unlocked by the open permissionless infrastructure of a blockchain system, and a forthcoming subsystem called the gateway system which provides a built in business-model for developers and entrepreneurs to build their offerings on top of the Joystream system.

And DAOs, which are built on the blockchain, are a key emerging infrastructure. Which is going to be part

of this new Web 3.0 world of decentralized communities essentially with new types of governance protocols.DAO on Ethereum was the first implementation of DAOs. So what they did was basically it was this group of people who decided they wanted to put money into a fund as an investment. It was just a fund that invests in different projects and things.They do it in this decentralized way where people get to choose and so it’s a little bit different from a traditional fund. But a bunch of people who came together decided that they were all co-owners of this investment fund and ultimately what happened was there was a hack.Actually ended up costing the DAO i think tens of millions of dollars in ETH and so there was a sort of big problem with the DAO that was a technical problem. Ultimately it sort of made it all fall apart and also resulted in the forking of the ethereum blockchain so the ethereum blockchain as it is today was not actually the original blockchain it was a fork.

But what I think is really interesting when you think about the history of dao’s is that we’ve had daos mostly serve as investment type funds where you have this crypto native way to invest. By crypto native way to invest i mean instead of having a fund that manages all this money you have the people who actually put in the money.As essentially being able to decide where they want that money to go they own like a very specific stake in the fund um but for quite a while that was the main use case of DAOs. It’s sort of the most clear about pooling resources to create value and one of the simplest ways to do that is by investing capital slowly though as DAOs have become more of this essentially like an interesting part of web3. We’ve begun to uncover new ways to create value together that aren’t just about investing money and so now you start to see a lot of different projects becoming DAOs and all these different things.

Essentially we’re finding new ways to collectively create and own things together and so that’s where i think DAOs were and now we’re much more in the space of DAOs can create media DAOs can invest DAOs can build product DAOs can govern public goods we have all these new interesting aspects of how we can collectively create value together which i think has been quite good an evolution from the original dao.

Joystream is a decentralized platform so there can’t be a permissioned backend for all Atlas persistence query needs. Instead, Atlas uses the following sources for its data.

This also applies to the field of video streaming. Recently, before the popularization of blockchain technology, we can see how the development of video streaming services stopped, except for a few monopolists. Joystream really brings something new to this area, it is a logical
