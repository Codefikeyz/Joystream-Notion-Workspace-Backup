# **Psychological substantiation of the effectiveness of management according to the DAO approach**

As you know, Joystream is one of the most difficult projects in terms of DAO. In this connection, it is worth analyzing the DAO principle itself, which will follow below, taking into account the psychological context of the effectiveness of this phenomenon.Digital media platforms have become key institutions organizing this area and activities. Therefore, it is very important how it is funded, distributed and paid for in the large scale Joystream project.DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a complex form of smart contract in which the rules of a decentralized organization are written into the contract code, while management occurs through tokens. That is, the DAO is an organization that operates autonomously and decentralized, the work of which is coordinated exclusively through a distributed consensus, in which anyone can participate. There is no centralization and no third party, however growth and profits are assumed.The idea has been around for quite some time and is being actively implemented in the blockchain industry.It is worth noting that the DAO phenomenon has similarities with the philosophical position of Taoism (a powerful direction of ancient Chinese philosophical thought).The Taoist system is based on the concept of “Tao” (“way”) — the first principle, an impersonal world law, the way of comprehending nature and its laws. Within the framework of Taoism, the concept of non-action arises — the denial of centralized and purposeful activity that runs counter to the natural world order. Taoists substantiated the idea of universal equality and social justice. In the Middle Ages, a network of Taoist monasteries was created throughout China, however, outside of their community, the Taoists had no influence (also in projects — having some functions in one of them, outside of which they are erased if a person enters into another project ).Can’t find any similarities? Consider this management style through the prism of psychology and the likely effectiveness of DAO.Let us take into account that the object of study of management psychology is people who are in financial and legal relations in independent organizations, whose activities are focused on corporately useful goals.At the same time, an organization can be considered as a social group that unites a certain set of people with common aspirations to achieve a common goal.Management psychology can be viewed as an interdisciplinary scientific and practical direction, the purpose of which is to research and provide psychological support for solving the problems of organizations, mainly in a market system.So a comparison.Organizational management is a specially organized type of management activity for the implementation of management functions in an organization, carried out by management personnel, endowed with appropriate powers and responsibility for this. The main goal of organizational management is to ensure the effective functioning of the organization and the optimal solution of its tasks.Decentralized governance. An organizational structure in which top management exercises minimal (strategic) control and management of operations and rules for clearly delineated activities and operations. Decentralized governance gives more freedom to make decisions at the lower levels of responsibility centers. This allows you to free up centralized levels of control.DAO disrupts traditional governance that is always centralized. In this case, there is a vote to govern the system, and each vote is counted in an impartial manner.In this case, all employees are covered (if they themselves are interested), with centralized management, many people go just to work somewhere without interest, which can adversely affect the effectiveness of the quality and quantity of activities. Lower-level workers may not be privy to the goals, objectives and strategy of the organization, and, therefore, decisions will not be made or will be made incorrectly. Decentralization can weaken control over the activities of the grassroots units, which will affect the efficiency of the entire organization.It also helps to simplify the system and allows for incremental expansion.Benefits of decentralized structures:- it is impossible to manage large organizations centrally due to the huge amount of required information;- decentralization stimulates initiative and allows the individual to identify with the organization;When designing an organization, the following factors can influence the choice between centralization and decentralization:1) the capital intensity of the decisions made, many enterprises document the specific amount within which the manager can make certain decisions;2) uniformity of policy;3) organizational culture;4) management philosophy;5) the desire of parts for independence. The separation of a part from the whole organization is accompanied by the desire of this part to turn into a new whole.

Interesting to know. Decentralized companies are, on average, more efficient than firms where the CEO tries to keep things under his own control.Reasonable delegation of authority is one of the essential principles of successful management. It also works in the situation of managing large firms and corporations. This is confirmed by the research conducted by Irina Levina among firms operating in Europe and Russia.In the course of the study, results were obtained that describe the factors that affect the possibility of centralization or decentralization of company management. There are many such factors — the size of the company, the quality of human capital, the socio-demographic characteristics of the CEO, the presence of kinship or family ties between the CEO and the owners of the company.According to the results of the study, firms with a decentralized management system are more often involved in international trade, innovation and research activities, and are more likely to train their employees. Meanwhile, as Irina Levina noted, decentralization is not an easy process for a company, since it is associated with many costs and depends on a number of factors.This is interesting (psychology). The personal characteristics of the CEO also partly influence the nature of management. Male leaders tend to be more centralized than female leaders. In some countries, there is a relationship between the age of a company leader and the choice of management style (centralized or decentralized).Thus, the obtained psychological analysis can be used by companies to improve the efficiency of their activities.
