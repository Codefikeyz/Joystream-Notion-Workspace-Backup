**What’s DAO?**

DAO is simply a decentralized autonomous organization, is like any traditional organization like JoystreamDAO, Google, uber etc. but the big difference is that it is autonomous, which means that the activities and decision-making powers are handed to the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of fund. It is completely transparent, autonomous and works without the involvement of human intervention, including its original creators.

**How does it work?**

DAOs operate **using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met**. Smart contracts are deployed on numerous blockchains nowadays, though Ethereum was the first to use them. These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules.

**IMPORTANCE OF DAO.**

The term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. first, we have it “decentralized” and “autonomous”. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete decentralization. Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs leverage blockchain for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

DAOs don’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business and entity is vested in the group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens ( for instance the token name for Joystream is known as tJOY), which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals. Multiple DAOs with popular examples such as JoystreamDAO, Curve DAO, MakerDAO, and others have encouraged many developers and business owners to opt for DAOs.

So, DAO is a modern and streamlined approach to operating a business because the problem that those who use dials do risk running into legal issues and all of the laws around businesses and their corporate structures really are not made to fit into the decentralized organizations until recently DAO exist, giving the accountability and structure of the business.

**Examples of DAO.**

There are various groups in business that operate as DAOs. Each group has a unique mission, rules, and guidelines. Here are examples of well-known DAOs:

 **PlearsDAO**: Gather multiple digital collectibles and engage in various investments.

 **HerStory** DAO: Contributes finances to fund various programs by Black women.

 **Komorebi Collective DAO:** It funds women and bigender crypto founders.

 **Friends with Benefits DAO**: It’s a unique community where you pay to join.

 **MetaCartel Venture DAO**: it’s an NGO whose focus is to invest in early-stage crypto dApps.

**Conclusion**

Although DAOs may not be a fit for each business, they have multiple features that can make processes in a company more efficient. Transparent, immutable, and trustless smart contracts make the DAO model the best for many organizations. Each day this Ethereum development project keeps improving, and its future looks bright.
