# **History and achievements of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1136/1*adIwexvb3aqdyqJ6tlVDGQ.png)

DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), first launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain. After raising $150 million worth of Ether (ETH) through a token sale. But after that, DAO was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base.

How did it happen?In early May 2016, several members of the Ethereum community announced the creation of The DAO, also known as the Genesis DAO. It was built as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The coding platform was developed open source by the Slock.It team, but it was deployed under the name “DAO” by members of the Ethereum community. The DAO had a creation period during which anyone could send ether to a unique wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens on a scale of 1 to 100. The creation period was an unexpected success as it managed to raise 12.7 million ether (at the time it cost about $150 million), making it the largest crowdfunding effort ever. At one point, when Ether was trading at $20, total Ether from the DAO was worth over $250 million.

But on June 17, 2016, a hacker found a loophole in the code that allowed him to withdraw funds from The DAO. In the first few hours of the attack, 3.6 million ETH was stolen, which at that time was equivalent to $70 million.

While traditional organizations are run by specific leaders, DAOs are run by computer code. Blockchain-based governance ensures that no single person is in control of the community, as in Joystream, where everyone can offer ideas to improve the project, and thus all investors make decisions faster and more transparently. An experienced blockchain development company can help you develop a DAO and include smart contracts in it for faster operation.

DAOs obtain their consensus through digital contracts that exist on the blockchain. Virtual contracts are executed automatically and contain immutable data protected from unauthorized access. Algorithms integrate complex data and get rid of the requirements of human guidance. At the same time, making decisions through DAO is faster and more convenient. Joystream uses the DAO method for decision making which makes it faster and better, you don’t need the physical presence of people to vote on an issue.

The best thing about developing DAOs is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for organizations to focus on achieving their collective interests. Participants do not need to know each other as the participation rules are built into a transparent, secure open source blockchain record.

According to the latest report from Messari, one of the trends in the crypto industry in 2022 is DAOs. During the year, we may see the restructuring of such organizations, the emergence of child DAOs and a new distribution of roles between participants. Autonomous decentralized organizations will have better collaboration tools, which will allow the community to get rid of passivity and become more efficient. DAO tools will help them with this. This is a trend that we can see throughout the existence of Joystream.

DAOs are moving towards official recognition. In April 2021, Wyoming passed a law recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations as a new form of company. A few months later, the first DAO was approved. But in November 2021, the SEC suspended token registrations from the first legally recognized entity, saying it provided “misleading information” to potential investors.

In 2021, there was a wave of investment DAOs where token holders could invest their money in NFTs, Web3 projects, cryptocurrencies, or other DAOs. An example of such an organization is Joystream, which allows video creators to monetize their work through the Atlas platform.
