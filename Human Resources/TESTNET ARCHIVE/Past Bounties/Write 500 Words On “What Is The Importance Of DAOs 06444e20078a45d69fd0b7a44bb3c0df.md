***Understanding Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)***

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization built on a computer program that is transparent without central authority, all member within a DAO usually shares a common goal and make effort to act in the best interest of the entity. Promoted through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and block chain technology, DAO are member owned organization with no central leadership. A good example is Joystream a video platform in comparison to known video platforms that are centralized, it is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its user. A platform for streaming and sharing video content governed by DAO. The goal of Joystream is to focus more on content creators, creatives and also consumers.

As a DAO the reward distribution is fair and transparent, censorship resistance and immunity to interventions by global entities compare to known centralized video platforms that requires a lot of trust in the people behind it especially on behalf of investors but with DAOs, there is room for transparency since it decentralized. All action on a DAO has to be approved by the community, this makes it completely transparent and verifiable.

The rapid growth and advantages of DAOs presently have encouraged a lot of interest in DAO. The diverse phases of evolution in the [block chain](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/) and [crypto](https://101blockchains.com/what-is-cryptocurrency/) space have been responsible for spurring many new practice cases. [Decentralized finance](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-finance-defi/) services and [non-fungible tokens](https://101blockchains.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft/) or the [metaverse](https://101blockchains.com/metaverse-technology/) are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to block chain and crypto. Among the many prospects developing in this space, [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao/) have been achieving a lot of adhesion.

# **Importance of DAOs**

Here are a number of reasons why DAO is important

**Decentralization**: Resolutions affecting the organization are made by members, a DAO can spread out authority across a vastly larger range of users.

**Participation:** Individuals feel more relevant and attached to the body when they have a direct say or ability to vote on matter affecting the entity which is often confined on certain individual in a central entity.

**Transparency:** DAO, votes are cast through block chain and publicly viewable to all. This encourage good conduct and discourage acts against the community.

**Globalization:** The model of a DAO emboldens people from all over the world to effortlessly come together to build a single vision. With just an internet connection, token holders can network with other owners wherever they may live.

Summarily the list of DAOs is broad. it has turn out to be a clear concept that has been gaining power. Some projects are still looking to reach whole decentralization through the DAO model, but it’s worth indicating they are only a few years old and have yet to achieve their final goals and objectives.

As internet-native organizations, DAOs have the prospect to change the way corporate governance works totally. While the concept matures and the legal gray area they operate in is cleared, more and more organizations may adopt a DAO model to help govern some of their activities.
