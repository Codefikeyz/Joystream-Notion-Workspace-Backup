# **What is the importance of DAOs?**

As we know, DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. It is also a system that is controlled by program code and does not depend on the human factor.

The DAO does not have a central node or chief executive. All participants in the ecosystem have the same rights and can vote for various changes inside on an equal basis with other users. And this means that all activities are transparent to everyone.

As an example — **the [https://joystream.org](https://joystream.org/) platform**. It is a decentralized DAO blockchain platform that is managed and owned by all of its users.

One of the main goals of DAO is to reduce the influence of people on the company’s processes. Accordingly, the number of intermediaries is reduced, and the work becomes better and more efficient.

DAO originated from the crypto industry, but according to the same laws, it can be applied in offline business. For example, a DAO can control hiring, salary increases, and other functions of any organization.

Any decisions in the DAO cannot be made independently. All this is done by the community. Any member of the organization can propose an improvement, and if other members vote for this improvement, it will be accepted. Conversely, the proposal may be rejected.

The time allotted for making a decision is determined by the minutes, and it can also be changed by voting.

Also, developers cannot make changes without community approval.

Information about all transactions is stored in the blockchain, and any user can always check what is happening on the network. Therefore, DAO is not only decentralized, but also transparent.

In any offline business, decisions are made by a small group of leaders. The decision made cannot be challenged by employees. But in DAO, all decisions are made jointly. And this is an important feature that could be applied in offline business. But unfortunately offline business is not yet ready for this.

The meaning of the DAO economy in the crypto space is to involve users in the active management and development of the ecosystem of a particular platform. As a rule, users, participating in voting, can receive rewards. There are many ways to vote on the network, but often in favor of the chosen offer, the user needs to freeze their coins or sign a transaction from their address.

The second plus of DAO is autonomy. Once launched, the protocol works without intervention from management. Users perform transactions, and the smart contract monitors the fulfillment of the obligations from each parties. In the event that one party does not fulfill the terms of the transaction, it will not be completed.

DAO, like any other thing related to crypto, is a new technology. Some experts are inclined to believe that DAO is a revolution for which the infrastructure and people are not yet ready. In 5 years, it is indeed possible to see something like this, including the use of DAO in the real world and offline business.

And, I hope, then organizations in offline business will become more transparent and more efficient in their activities.
