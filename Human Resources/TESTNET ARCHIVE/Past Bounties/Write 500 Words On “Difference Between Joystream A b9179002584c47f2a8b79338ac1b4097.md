# **Difference Between Joystream And Other DAOs**

In our dynamically developing world, more and more new projects appear every day in different areas of life, and more and more the world is immersed from offline to online and organizes, no matter how loud it sounds, future metauniverses.

Today we will talk about one of the leaders of the future web 3.0, namely the DAO called Joystream and its features. Joystream is a video platform managed by DAO, which means there are all sorts of ways you can join and earn by contributing to the project. Sounds cool, doesn’t it? Let’s dive into its distinguishing features next.

Joystream is often compared to YouTube. And it is not for nothing that these two platforms are compared as the largest representative of web 2.0 and the representative of web 3.0. Yes, globally these are two video platforms, but fundamentally they are two different products. When Joystream is controlled by users like other DAOs, YouTube is an example of the old corporatocracy that pursues the interests of shareholders and is afraid of losing an extra penny of profit, therefore, monitors users everywhere, introduces new and new types of censorship, takes into account the whims of the state apparatus in different countries, thus thereby driving users into the frame and assigning their content to your site.

Now let’s talk about Joystream! This is a representative of the new web 3.0 generation, where all content belongs to the user, who receives all the profit from his work, moreover, is controlled and managed by the users themselves. They can make important decisions, suggest ideas for development, and vote on user initiatives. Yes, Joystream has the same hierarchy of top management and field managers, but they all work for the good of the community and create an ecosystem both inside and outside the company.

**Another distinguishing feature of Joystream is 2 dApps, these are Atlas and Pioneer.**

Let’s take a look at Atlas — it’s a video platform where community members publish videos, monetize them, connect with the audience, engage the audience in small communities around the author, and even sell the video as art, next we’ll look at two cool features.

The first is to sell your videos like NFT, thereby monetizing your creativity in this way and creating a collection from it.The second is the release of their own tokens, which the author can share with the audience and unite his fans into groups.

Now a little about **Pioneer** and best described by the words of the developers:“It’s a management application that was created with one goal in mind: to make Joystream a fully decentralized autonomous organization. This means we had to create features that most other DAO management apps don’t have, such as our online forum, in-depth suggestion system, and workgroup structure”

Summing up the results of a short digression, you need to understand the following. When we talk about web 3.0 and Joystream, we mean that the content belongs to the user, as well as the rights to use it and monetize the content. Only you decide what to do with it and how.
