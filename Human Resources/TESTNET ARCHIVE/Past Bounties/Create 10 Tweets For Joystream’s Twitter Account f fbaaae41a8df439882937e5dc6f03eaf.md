Hello everyone, today I want to touch on the topic of [@JoystreamDAO](https://twitter.com/JoystreamDAO). Joystream is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Let's take a look at the main points

Its difference from popular centralized solutions is that Jotstream is focused on those who create content, in particular video

Atlas is a video platform with a wide range of options for creators and video producers. You can get paid for uploading quality videos on this platform.

The big benefits of Joystream are fairer distribution of rewards, resistance to censorship, and immunity to interference from global organizations.

You can also monetize your NFT sales videos. Video producers can create their videos in NFT and put them up for sale

The Joystream DAO is a hierarchy of people who have come together to build the future of this decentralized video platform. Working on the Joystream DAO rewards everyone with [$JOY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JOY&src=cashtag_click) tokens based on their contribution.

The [$JOY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JOY&src=cashtag_click) token will gain value on the platform as it will need to be burned to access key network features, and the more these features are used, the more [$JOY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JOY&src=cashtag_click) tokens will be burned.

The main part of Joystream is Pioneer. It is a management application that gives Joystream users the ability to create their own decentralized autonomous organization ecosystem.
