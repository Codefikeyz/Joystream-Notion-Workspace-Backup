## **WHAT İS THE İMPORTANCE OF DAO?**

My First article will be about a project i like to be part of. I hope you like it too. The Joystream DAO. New video streaming platform and governed by its own users. Enjoy…

Let us start with defination of DAO. We see it everywhere around these days and many pople don’t konow about it. In a more simple way, DAOs are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, and they refer to any collectively-managed, blockchain-based organization that functions autonomously. Instead of having a central management team or hierarchy, DAOs provide their members with the collective power to run the organization using smart contracts, autonomous blockchain protocols that perform actions according to their defined program.

So far DAOs are being used for many purposes such as investment, charity, fundraising, borrowing, or buying NFTs, all without intermediaries. The Web 3 spreads and continue to adapt many more sectors from the real life. Decenteralisation for governance and transparanciy for blockchain are the keys of this improvement.

In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratized organization. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented, instead of implemented changes by a sole party (depending on the company’s structure). The funding of DAOs is mainly based on crowdfunding that issues tokens. The governance of DAOs is based on community, while traditional companies’ governance is mostly based on executives, Board of Directors, activist investors. etc. DAOs’ operations are fully transparent and global, meanwhile, traditional companies’ operations are private, only the organization know what is happening, and they are not always global.

Now you can imagine a World full of new organisations with other people around the world, without knowing each other and establishing their own rules, and making their own decisions autonomously all encoded on a Blockchain. DAOs are making this real.

We can list the importance of DAOs in 4 categories:

1-Decentralized autonomous organizations are changing the way we think about how organizations work, and how they may work in the future. Because of their unique structure, DAOs offer the promise of enabling a focus on community, rather than just profit, and might offer a more socially-conscious structure.

2-Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires much trust in the people you’re working with. But it’s hard to trust someone you’ve only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs, you don’t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAO’s code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.

3-It is possible to have a rich, connected experience without a central operator: enabling markets to set pricing and quality, and enabling the participants whose labour and choices support the experience to profit directly on DAOs.

4-Web3 describes the shift from a centralized, community-focused internet to a decentralized, individual-focused internet. Web3 aims to improve privacy, protect data, and provide more autonomy to users. DAOs are an important part of the transition from the Web2 to the Web3 paradigms

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations model the increasingly popular values of the Web3 paradigm. DAOs may not be a fit for each business, they have multiple features that can make processes in a company more efficient. Transparent, immutable, and trustless smart contracts make the DAO model the best for many organizations. Each day blockchain tecnology keeps improving, and its future looks bright.

Joystream DAO is one of the project that show us how blockchain tecnology can adap tp real life and Web3. Now we can stream videos no our own channels with Joystream’s Atlas application and we can control it with DAO. Not others. If you are interested, yo can wisit and join (DYOR!)
