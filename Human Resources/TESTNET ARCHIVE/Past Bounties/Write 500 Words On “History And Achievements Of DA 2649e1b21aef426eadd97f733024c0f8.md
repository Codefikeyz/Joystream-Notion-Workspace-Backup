Society is an endeavor in human coordination and organization. Governments organize people and the state to serve and provide for the welfare of its citizens. Politicians organize the constituents they serve. CEOs organize workers and resources to satisfy their customers. However, most of us will never sit in these positions of power, responsible for coordinating humans at scale. This divide between the coordinators and the coordinated has resulted in a disconnect in values and goals between the two groups. This is exactly why, when we try to change things around us it feels like we do not have the power to do so.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are an effective way to work with like-minded people from all over the world. Think of them as an internet-native organization that is collectively managed and owned by its members. DAOs provide the tools necessary to effectively organize people and resources, making them accessible to everyone. If enough people want to work towards a common goal, they can organize themselves, and work towards changing and shaping the future as they see fit.

**ORIGIN OF DAOs**

The concept of a DAO has been around for quite a while but has flourished in earnest.

The first references to DAOs emerged in the 1990’s, to describe multi-agent systems in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment and non-violent decentralized action in the counter-globalization social movements. The contemporary meaning of DAOs can be traced back to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC), which appeared almost synonymously with Bitcoin. The DAC model was used as a concept in early forums and the chats of early crypto enthusiasts and referred to a governance model that used tokenized shares as a means of providing dividends to shareholders. As the term was linked to a corporate governance model, it was seen as too restrictive and thus was abandoned.

In late 2013, the concept re-emerged due to an article by V. Buterin, in which he suggested the term Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) to describe the ‘holy grail’ of organization types, an ‘entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do.’

Because of their unique structure, DAOs offer the promise of enabling a focus on community, rather than just profit, and might offer a more socially-conscious structure; one designed to help individuals everywhere prosper instead of focusing only on the desires of a few large shareholders. This could have ramifications not only for businesses, but also in terms of how we address the causes that are important to us today as a society. While DAOs are not without their own challenges, they have the potential to improve upon a style of corporate organization that hasn’t meaningfully changed in hundreds of years. In fact, most US corporations today are structured in essentially the same way as they were in the 1600s: companies accept investor funds in exchange for the responsibility of maximizing shareholder value as their primary (and sometimes only) mission. It is this profit-minded directive that has been the fuel of capitalism — both the good and the bad. The good has led to significant improvements in business efficiency, while the bad has frequently manifested itself in the pursuit of profits above all else; even at the cost of employee benefits and quality of life, increases in income inequality, and damage to our environment.
