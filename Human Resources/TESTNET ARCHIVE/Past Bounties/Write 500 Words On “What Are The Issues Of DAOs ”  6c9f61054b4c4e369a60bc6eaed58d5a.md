# **Write 500 Words On “What Are The Issues Of DAOs?”**

Joystream is a decentralized platform for streaming and sharing video content governed by DAO. The main goal of Joystream is to focus more on content creators, creatives and also consumers. With fairer reward distribution, censorship resistance and immunity to interventions by global entities.

Joystream ([https://www.joystream.org/](https://www.joystream.org/)) is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. In comparison to known video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its users.Challenges with DAOs

Joystream is one of many decentralized autonomous organizations and is also faced with a lot of challenges and issues which sometimes restrict their growth in general.

While DAOs look promising, they are still a young invention with several uncertainties that need to be addressed. In no particular order, the five challenges that rock most DAOs currently are:

Poor Infrastructures

Since DAOs are purely digital and decentralized, they often lack a well-developed and efficient infrastructure their traditional counterparts enjoy. Many DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’. DAOs suffer from having the right infrastructures for reporting, treasury management, governance, payroll, communication, identity management, etc. Without the right infrastructure to handle these duties, many DAOs may lose members and eventually fail to gain traction. However, the increased rate of innovations and collaborations in the Web3 space is gradually helping to solve some of these problems.

Legal Battles

DAOs share similarities with many organisations of today like corporations, non-profits, partnerships (both general and limited liability), and cooperatives. But these organisations are all regulated and governed by the rules of the different terrains they are rooted in.

DAOs, on the other hand, are purely decentralized without a particular location, and the rules governing them are not specific to that of any existing legal framework. In many regions of the world today, DAOs battle with regulatory issues such as taxation of DAO tokens, treasuries, and investments, how to get insurance on investments, implementing AML and CFT policies, and who takes responsibility for a DAO’s actions. Without a clear system to solve these legal challenges, it’ll be hard for DAOs to gain ground in the physical world.

Navigating Blockchains and Contracts — Risks & Un-immutability

Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security.

Many smart contract networks have faced a series of attacks with some protocols drained of millions of dollars sometimes. For example, the first DAO known as “The DAO” is a typical example of the impact of such vulnerabilities. A more recent event is the $120 million hack of BadgerDAO. Division within a DAO can lead to fragmentation and result in splits.

All these situations break the censorship resistance feature which attracted many to the web3 space. On the flip side, this can help in scaling many projects beyond the limits Web3’s “good feature” of immutability has placed on them.

Effective Coordination or Complete Decentralisation

The governance structures in most DAOs are the typical democratic system of one man, one vote. While this structure has many advantages, it’s not the best way to actively manage corporations especially when decisions that need to be taken require expertise.

Traditional organisations function with certain hierarchies because getting every employee or member to vote on decisions is highly ineffective and can prove disastrous. Imagine if everyone in an organisation needs to vote on the SEO strategy that needs to be employed or the code base a developer needs to use. A large token holder without adequate experience can negatively influence decisions. People with experience are needed to make hard and technical decisions. However, many DAOs didn’t anticipate the challenge.

People (Community) Over Profit or Just a bunch of rich folks combining to increase their earnings

Even with the possibilities DAOs are bringing to the web3 space, some critics argue that many DAOs are just a bunch of average rich folks combining wealth to increase their earnings without any regard for the fundamentals of decentralisation and community.

According to web3 proponents, DAOs are supposed to remove the barrier of entry in hierarchical organisations by democratising their structures so that the average individual can participate in the decision-making process and receive the same empowerment as the traditionally rich class.

But the minimum capital that qualifies one for membership in most DAOs of today serves as a barrier for many average individuals. Some DAOs set the requirements for membership at $100,000 or more as the case may be. And such figures may be quite expensive for some people to afford.
