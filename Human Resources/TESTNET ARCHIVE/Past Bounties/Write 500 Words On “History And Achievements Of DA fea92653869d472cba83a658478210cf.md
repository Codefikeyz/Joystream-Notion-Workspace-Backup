# **History and Achievement Of DAO**

DAOs will impact how businesses are structured, how individuals lead and how a company operates internally.

You have probably heard about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) by now, which have become a dominant force in the news and have emerged in various industries. They have emerged in the blockchain, sports, politics, and entertainment industries.

DAOs unite people around a common goal or interest. If looked at more closely, DAOs show how large groups of people can be organized as a decision-making entity — something that will ultimately disrupt the way businesses work.

DAOs will have an impact on how businesses are structured, and the way individuals lead and are recognized within companies. Ultimately, DAOs will provide a happier and healthier work environment for all those involved.

**History of DAO**

The starting point for the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations can be considered the emergence of Ethereum, the first blockchain platform in which the logic of smart contracts was implemented. Smart contracts made it possible to create autonomous systems controlled by a program, and not by a person, which eliminates the possibility of data manipulation, thus there is no dependence on the human factor.

Thanks to smart contracts, it has become possible to create various decentralized systems that allow users to perform transactions without the participation of intermediaries. These include DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXes), applications (DApps), and autonomous organizations (DAOs).

The DAO protocol, launched in 2016, became the first platform that embodied the principles of decentralized autonomous organization. However, in the same year, hackers found a vulnerability in the service’s smart contract and withdrew approximately 3.6 million Ethereum coins from it, which at that time was about $60 million.

This incident led to a hard fork (a hard fork is a

fundamental change in the operation of algorithms and the code itself) in the Ethereum network and the emergence of a new branch in the form of Ethereum Classic. The hard fork was necessary to eliminate the vulnerability and restore the funds of Ethereum coin holders. The “new” blockchain that arose as a result of the hard fork retained the name Ethereum, while the “old” one was named Ethereum Classic. After the separation, the networks began to function as separate ecosystems with their own blockchains, and users became owners of coins in both networks.

**How DAOs Have Evolved — And What’s Next**

**Decentralized autonomous organizations are changing how we collaborate — but to realize their potential they need to become easier to set up and use.**

DAOs are often described as “group chats with a wallet,” but that’s something of an understatement: DAO treasuries across all networks currently hold over $10 billion in total, according to DAO analytics tracker DeepDAO.

The new organizational structure that DAOs represent is better thought of in the wider context

of crypto. Just as cryptocurrencies seek to replace fiat currencies or traditional asset classes like gold, DAOs offer an alternative to traditional business structures.

DAOs are strictly online with no physical HQ, operate on a flat management structure (meaning no c-level executives) and are “token-aligned,” meaning members propose and vote on governance decisions according to their token holding just as in the joystreamDAO which is know as tjoy. Some DAOs automatically enforce decisions, while others take it as a binding decision on the core contributors or paid team members to execute those decisions.

But just as DAOs come with a new ethos, structures, and tooling, they create barriers to entry for those without the appropriate skillset; it’s not easy to start a DAO if you aren’t a smart contract whiz.

Nader Al-Naji, founder of social blockchain DeSo, says his team has created a solution for those who need a low-cost, convenient way to launch DAOs to address the current “lack of DAO tooling.” It’s called DAODAO, and as the name suggests, it’s a DAO that wants to give birth to new DAOs.

“DAODAO is for people who want to focus on scaling their ideas rather than fumbling with the tech,” Al-Naji told *Decrypt*. “With DAODAO you can launch a DAO as easily as creating a social media account.” With mainstream interest in the benefits of DAO structures growing, he added, DAODAO is positioned to be “the keystone for the next chapter of DAO evolution.”

Decentralized autonomous organizations differ from traditional ones not only by their location on a blockchain. DAO is a form of collective business conduct, in which the rights and obligations of the participants are programmed by means of smart contracts. They are also exempt from the need for paperwork or record-keeping. For a DAO to function properly, several mandatory tools must be in place:

 A robust smart contract. This is a program through which DAO participants can propose ideas, vote, and manage the organization.

 A set of rules. These are spelled out in the smart contract and can only be changed through voting by DAO participants. The rules specify the provisions of the vote, the time of

 the vote, the required ratio of votes to win, and the distribution of the organization’s profits among the participants.

 Organization Assets. Each DAO issues its own tokens. With these, participants vote and influence the development of the project. Everyone who wants to join a DAO will have to redeem these tokens.

Achievement

We are still in the early innings of this revolution in DAO infrastructure. Ideas regarding DAOs and their governance mechanisms have been around for quite a while, yet we are just beginning to experience the proliferation of these organizations. Alongside the growth of technically-oriented DAOs, we have lately experienced the rise of a different, socially-oriented approach to them.

Even though there is no hard line that separates these two segments, as DAOs exist on a spectrum of decentralization and autonomy, socially-oriented DAOs primarily exist to bring people together, find

new ways for them to interact, assemble and collaborate.

Examples of these types of DAOs include collectives and pseudo-anonymous groups that manage funds, share their passion for artists and NFTs (JoystreamDAO, PleasrDAO & FlamingoDAO), or even create media, social, and culture DAOs (BanklessDAO & FWB).

In this sense, it can be claimed that contemporary DAOs are communities of people who decide to align their ideas, values, and vision, and devote their time to creating organizations that are based on the core values of the blockchain world (openness, transparency, and decentralization).

As mentioned above, DAOs represent a shift from traditional companies in that they can be global and geographically decentralized from the start, permissionless in their access and contribution, and able to minimize frictions around employment, contracts, and identity.

While everything looks like we are moving towards a new era in regards to the structure, the functionality, and the products of a modern DAO, there is one thing we can say for sure- the types of social coordination, the degree of innovation, the flourishing of creativity, and the new ways of relating to one another that the DAOs have unlocked, is here to stay and will revolutionize our world.
