**What are the problems of DAOs?**

DAOs are here to stay, and their influence on conventional working environments and relationships can already be felt. But, as they are still something new, most of their strengths and weaknesses are still being discovered. We have a lot to learn about how to get the best out of them.

The good news is that they thrive in a highly adaptive environment and are controlled by people willing to innovate and find better solutions whenever necessary. In this article, you will understand the main problems faced by DAOs. So, keep reading!

# **Governance**

The main characteristic of DAOs is the fact that they have decentralized governance. It means that the decisions taken by the organization pass through the scrutiny of teams or individuals and are taken democratically. But including too many people in decision-making can make the process time-consuming and inefficient.

In addition, there are technical complications. The distribution of tokens that give voting power is the subject of study by several DAOs worldwide. Many have already found ways to serve the organization’s and contributors’ interests, but most are still struggling to reach a consensus on this issue.

# **Capital**

And money is the root of yet another problem faced by DAOs. It is necessary to maintain an inflow of resources for organizations to develop, just like any other business. After all, the time dedicated to them needs to be reciprocated so that contributors can continue to do their work sustainably.

However, when the money flows into the cash register, there can also be problems related to the distribution of governance. After all, in addition to financial retribution, people who contribute to DAOs want to have the power of decision. They don’t like to be subjugated in votes by people who only made significant financial contributions.

# **Contributors**

As you may have noticed, people are at the heart of the problems facing DAOs. It is very positive because it shows a constant concern of organizations to find ways to produce value and give people back in abundance, offering a better alternative than what they find in the conventional market.

And they must keep looking for it because it’s common for contributors to report great tiredness. After all, intellectual work can be extremely exhausting, especially for people who have relationships with different organizations and have different commitments and tasks to fulfill.

But if you join a DAO such as Joystream DAO you will choose when and which tasks you will pick. If you please and commit enough, you can even be invited to participate in Working Groups, with a constant remuneration, besides the freedom and space to expose your ideas and influence the management. It is something you rarely find in the mainstream job market.

If you still don’t relate to any DAO, be sure to give it a try. You will have the opportunity to meet amazing people and participate in the creation and development of something, and you can even find fantastic opportunities for personal and professional development.
