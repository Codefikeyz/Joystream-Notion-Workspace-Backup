# **Transformation of DAOs**

One of the earliest DAOs, a project called The DAO, illustrates one of the most straightforward use cases of a DAO and also happens to be pivotal in the history of DAOs. The Genesis DAO, as it was also known, was an investment contract allowing Ether (ETH) holders to deposit their funds. Projects could apply to The DAO for funding, and if DAO token holders agreed to the investment terms, the smart contract would disburse funds. However, inJune 2016, within weeks of launch, a hacker found a bug in the underlying smart contract code and managed to drain The DAO of around $70 million worth of ETH.

At the time, the incident wreaked havoc in the Ethereum community, and as a result, DAOs made little progress over the subsequent two or three years. However, once the touch paper of the DeFi movement was lit, the idea of DAOs took off once again. These events are what gave birth to Current DAOs of our time like Joystream DAO,Uniswap , Bitmont and so many others.DeFi emerged from the desire among the blockchain community to create an open, permission less, decentralized financial system. As such, DAOs offered an attractive way for projects to demonstrate their commitment to decentralizationthrough community governance.

As a result, during 2020, when DeFi began to gain rapid ground, governance tokens became vastly popular. Flagship DeFi apps including Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) launched tokens allowing users to participate in decentralized governance, while newcomer DeFi projects have taken to launching their governance tokens from the start. These transformation and events still take roots in the likes of Uniswap, Joystream and even ether. So why are DAOs now making such a splash even among mainstream news outlets? Part of the reason is the surge in popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which are set to play a more significant role in DAO governance and who gets to participate.

In September, Andreessen Horowitz invested $5 million into “Friends with Benefits,” a Discord chat comprised of various crypto enthusiasts, artists and NFT collectors. The group raised a total of $10 million when it decided to operate as a DAO, demonstrating the value to be generated from the vast online communities that have formed — even without economic incentives — on platforms like Facebook and Telegram. Joystream among others is one of the fastest growing and Talked about, the use of social media as a means of communication and promotion is key as seen in the case of Joystream which has multiple channels such as the Joystream Discord server, Twitter handle and even the Joystream Telegram .DAOs are governed by smart contracts.

DAOs are governed by the terms of smart contracts. Most recently, DAOs have gone beyond buying digital art or setting up online projects, to address wider global concerns. Ukraine DAO, set up by members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot and others, has raised $1.7 million towards humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, as the country battles the Russian invasion.

U.S. domestic politics is slowly entering the world of DAOs, too. Andrew Yang, a former candidate for U.S. president and New York City mayor, set up the Lobby3 DAO so that “people can see the benefit of these technologies” in the real world.

DAOs, Yang told Decrypt’s gm podcast, “could be a feature of a 21st century democracy… liquid democracy where people are assigning their voting rights on certain issues to other people who might have more expertise or more time.” It could, he argued, present an alternative to “floundering” democratic institutions that are “not truly representative.”
