Hey (blogger name)!

My name is (your name), I am (your position) at (company name, link to website). I recently discovered your blog and now enjoy following it.

I like your style, the subject of your resource and the presentation of the material. I would love to work with you and suggest content for your blog about our video platform.

In short, Joystream is a video platform that is controlled, owned and operated by its users. That is, a distinctive feature of the platform is decentralization. Joystream should be considered as an analogue of Vimeo, Rutube, or YouTube developed and maintained by the community. Users can upload, view, rate, comment, add to favorites and share certain videos.

Today, many sites for posting content are not honest enough with both users and other structures. There are many facts of collusion between streaming sites, market sharing, jurisdictional arbitration and sheer savings on everything. Also, if you are watching the political situation in the world, you might have noticed that the problem of censorship, blocking and harassment has sharply become actual. The reason for the existence of this decentralized platform is to remain honest and open to all people, without harassment of citizens of individual states, to give more freedom in self-expression (whether it be political or other views), not to bother with advertising and, if possible, compensate for the negative experience from advertising with various incentives. At the moment, the project is at the stage of open testing.

Now there is an opportunity both to upload and publish content, and to take part in the development of the project by helping in every possible way (graphics, design, terms of reference). Your contribution to the project will not go unnoticed, because a reward system has been developed for people who are really useful to the project. If you are interested in our offer, we will be happy to help you take the first steps on our platform and assign you a person who can become your Joystream guide. Thank you very much for your time, and let me know if you are interested! And, of course, if you have another suggestion, write. Thank you!
