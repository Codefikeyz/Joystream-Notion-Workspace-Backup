**What is DAOs?**

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

Joystream is a typical example of DAOs and one of the best that I’ve seen so far.

DAOs have replaced the classic centralized organization management model.

The direction and role of the company are predetermined and written into the smart contract. Anyone interested in buying into the DAO must agree to those terms before making their purchase. This means that a singular entity, whether a person or a committee, can’t buy into a DAO and make decisions driven primarily by self-interest. Rather, everyone who buys into a DAO is doing so to further the mission and goals of that organization.

For example, the Friends with Benefits DAO is a community of people who are passionate about decentralization and want to help shape the future of the technology.

**Importance of DAOs**

The term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clearly evident answers for your doubts. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-government/). Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs leverage [blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/) for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

DAOs don’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business and entity is vested in the group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals. Multiple DAOs with popular examples such as Curve DAO, [MakerDAO](https://101blockchains.com/makerdao/), and others have encouraged many developers and business owners to opt for DAOs.

· The diverse phases of evolution in the [blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/) and [crypto](https://101blockchains.com/what-is-cryptocurrency/) space have been responsible for spurring many new use cases. [Decentralized finance](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-finance-defi/) services and [non-fungible tokens](https://101blockchains.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft/) or the [metaverse](https://101blockchains.com/metaverse-technology/) are just the tips of the iceberg when it comes to blockchain and crypto. Among the many opportunities evolving in this space, [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao/) have been gaining a lot of traction.

Developed with the vision for creating internet-native organizations under the ownership and control of the members, DAOs offer favorable prospects for capitalizing on the benefits of crypto and [benefits of blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/benefits-of-blockchain-technology/). The advantages of DAO speak loads of the value they bring to the table.
