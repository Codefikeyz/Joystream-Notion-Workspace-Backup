[HISTORY OF DAO.](https://medium.com/@imafidonwisdom222/history-of-dao-da973dfe2a1c)

# **HISTORY OF DAO.**

The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that was launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain. After raising $150 million USD worth of ether (ETH) through a token sale, The DAO was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base.

When were DAO invented?

The DAO launched in late April 2016 thanks to a month-long crowd sale of tokens that raised more than $150 million in funds. 3 At the time, the launch was the largest crowdfunding fundraising campaign of all time.

At the beginning of May 2016, a few members of the Ethereum community announced the inception of The DAO, which was also known as Genesis DAO. It was built as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The coding framework was developed open source by the Slock.It team but it was deployed under “The DAO” name by members of the Ethereum community. The DAO had a creation period during which anyone was allowed to send Ether to a unique wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens on a 1–100 scale. The creation period was an unexpected success as it managed to gather 12.7M Ether (worth around $150M at the time), making it the biggest crowdfund ever. At some point, when Ether was trading at $20, the total Ether from The DAO was worth over $250 million.

In essence, the platform would allow anyone with a project to pitch their idea to the community and potentially receive funding from The DAO. for instance Joystream it allows the members to share their ideas about the project also in Joystream decision making is for all ,Anyone with DAO tokens could vote on plans, and would then receive rewards if the projects turned a profit. With the financing in place, things were looking up.

However, on June 17, 2016, a hacker found a loophole in the coding that allowed him to drain funds from The DAO. In the first few hours of the attack, 3.6 million ETH were stolen, the equivalent of $70 million at the time. Once the hacker had done the damage he intended, he withdrew the attack.

In this exploit, the attacker was able to “ask” the smart contract (DAO) to give the Ether back multiple times before the smart contract could update its balance. Two main issues made this possible: the fact that when the DAO smart contract was created the coders did not take into account the possibility of a recursive call and the fact that the smart contract first sent the ETH funds and then updated the internal token balance.

# **ACHIEVEMENTS OF DAO.**

# **1. Operate via a computer code**

Whereas traditional organizations are run by specific leaders, DAOs operate through computer code. Blockchain-based governance ensures that no single individual controls the community just like Joystream where they is a room for everyone to pitch in ideas for the betterment of the project and for all investors this way decisions are made faster in a transparent manner. An experienced [blockchain development company](https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/blockchain-development-how-to-hire-the-right-company/) can assist you to develop a DAO and incorporate intelligent contracts into it for faster operation.

# **2. Use of smart contracts**

DAOs derive their consensus via digital contracts that exist on the blockchain spine. The virtual contracts are self-executing and contain immutable data that are tamperproof. The algorithms integrate sophisticated data and do away with the requirement for human direction. That said, decision-making through DAO is faster and more convenient. Joystream uses a DAO method for decision making which makes it faster and better, you don’t need the physical presence of individuals to vote over an issue. A blockchain developer who is good at ethereum contract development can help you create smart contracts for DAO. The [DAO smart contracts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/?sh=59668ac17305) have the following information:

- Rules and regulations
- Guidelines
- Functionalities
- contract address

# **3. Instant trust and Transparency**

The best thing about DAO development is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe, and open-source blockchain record. Because blockchain ledger is tamperproof, no participant can alter the practices without a majority vote. So, the only role of a DAO entity is to advance the collective interest of a group or project like Joystream.

# **4. Community-based**

Unlike traditional organizations, DAOs have an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At DAO development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code.

Initially, individuals meet at various social networking sites and decide to contribute funds using ethereum contract development. After collecting funds, the group agrees on achieving its mission as a single entity.
