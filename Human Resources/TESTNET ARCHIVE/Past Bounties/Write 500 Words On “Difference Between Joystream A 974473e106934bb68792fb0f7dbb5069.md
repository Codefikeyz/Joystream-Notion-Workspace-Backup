# **Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

Firstly we need to understand what is a DAO. A decentralised autonomous organisation, also known as a DAO, is like any traditional organisation, like, say, Uber or Google. The big different is that it’s autonomous. It operates completely transparently and independent of any human intervention, including its original creators.

DAO’s are run by a programming code, written on a collection of smart contracts written on Ethereum.

Imagine an autonomous Uber-type transportation company. Let’s call it DAO Uber. DAO Uber has been created by a group of developers and entrepreneurs as an alternative to centralised transportation companies.

And let’s turn it up a notch further by saying that the cars this DAO will use are self-driving. So in this scenario, there’s no people involved once the DAO is released. When they get started, the creators a set up a series of interconnected and automated smart contracts on an open blockchain like Ethereum. A series of smart contracts will trigger invoices and collect payments from the people who ride in DAO Uber’s cars. And the smart contracts running the DAO would also use the money collected to maintain the cars, buying parts, arrange and pay for cleaning services and adjust prices according to its cost.

Again, you’ll notice one important element missing here — Humans!

There are some categories of DAOs: DAO operating System, Investment DAO, Protocol DAO, Grants DAO, Service DAO, Social DAO.

DAO operating systems now this is the starting block for a DAO ecosystem they offer the resources for people to start their own DAO. Next we have Grant DAOs and these were the first real use case for DAOs. This act is a form of venture capital funds communities can donate funds and also use DAOs to vote on how the capital is allocated to various contributors in the form of governance proposals. One of the most common is Protocol DAOs. Protocol DAOs really give the voting power back to the community. These tokens are used to vote on and also implement changes. We have investment DAOs. Investment DAOs allow members to pull capital and also invest in projects at the early stages although these do come with some more legal restrictions than typical VC fund. Next up we have social DAOs and these are really the natural evolution of group chats where friends can become co-workers and really interact on a decentralized platform. Service DAOs which are used to create decentralized working groups for individuals and also talent agencies so as more and more blockchain companies come into the market this helps bridge the gap between the talents and the communities collector dials really

Also we have media DAOs. Media DAOs incentivize content creators and consumers and both give them a reward ecosystem. The important notions are discussed proposed and implemented with all of the community’s

Most DAOs differ from each other in various ways. DAO joystream is very different in its organizational structure and video based plan. DAO joystream uses a platform known as Atlas to produce NFTs from videos, which means these videos can also be made as NFTs. Sharp, right? Another difference is that Joystream DAO also has a structural composition of different Working Groups, in which there are chiefs and their deputies, and members are also recruited into these working groups. In the DAO, votes are cast through the blockchain and become public. This requires users to act as they see fit so that their vote and their decisions are public. This encourages activities that will benefit the reputation of voters and discourage action against the community. Community.
