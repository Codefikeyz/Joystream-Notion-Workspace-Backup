# **Issues of DAOs**

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are gradually gaining traction in the Web3 space and even beyond as many are beginning to explore possible ways of investing in one.

Considering how bitcoin and DeFi have rewarded early investors handsomely, web3 enthusiasts are looking to jump on the DAO ship with the aim of making huge returns on their investments in the near future. Joystream a cool example of a DAO has rewarded its members, keeping in mind that the JOY mainnet will possibly launch in September 2022.Since DAOs are purely digital and decentralized, they often lack a well-developed and efficient infrastructure their traditional counterparts enjoy. Many DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’. The Joystream DAO and other notable DAOs take their rising stance through these beginning steps.

DAOs suffer from having the right infrastructures for reporting, treasury management, governance, payroll, communication, identity management, etc. Without the right infrastructure to handle these duties, many DAOs may lose members and eventually fail to gain traction.DAOs share similarities with many organizations of today like corporations, non-profits, partnerships (both general and limited liability), and cooperatives. But these organizations are all regulated and governed by the rules of the different terrains they are rooted in. Joystream on the other hand is well equipped on infrastructural basis.

DAOs, on the other hand, are purely decentralized without a particular location, and the rules governing them are not specific to that of any existing legal framework. In many regions of the world today, DAOs battle with regulatory issues such as taxation of DAO tokens, treasuries, and investments, how to get insurance on investments, implementing AML and CFT policies, and who takes responsibility for a DAO’s actions. Without a clear system to solve these legal challenges, it’ll be hard for DAOs to gain ground in the physical world.Even with the possibilities DAOs are bringing to the web3 space, some critics argue that many DAOs are just a bunch of average rich folks combining wealth to increase their earnings without any regard for the fundamentals of decentralization and community.

According to web3 proponents, DAOs are supposed to remove the barrier of entry in hierarchical organizations by democratizing their structures so that the average individual can participate in the decision-making process and receive the same empowerment as the traditionally rich class. Although the fear of domination by the rich doesn't necessarily affect most DAOs . Joystream for instance has its members connected through working groups where all Joystream members contribute interchangeably.The governance structures in most DAOs are the typical democratic system of one man, one vote. While this structure has many advantages, it’s not the best way to actively manage corporations especially when decisions that need to be taken require specialization.Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security.

Many smart contract networks have faced a series of attacks with some protocols drained of millions of dollars sometimes. For example, the first DAO known as “The DAO” is a typical example of the impact of such vulnerabilities. A more recent event is the $120 million hack of Badger DAO.

Division within a DAO can lead to fragmentation and result in splits which we have seen with popular crypto networks:

The Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split was caused by disagreements in responding to The DAO attack. The response of the Ethereum community puts the immutability of blockchains in question. The Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hardcore was caused by a disagreement in block sizes.

Additionally, DAOs can stand against the “code is law” crypto ethos many enthusiasts project. An example is the JUNO Network DAO which voted to revoke the tokens of a whale. While the decision was to safeguard the future of the project, it breaks the foundation of immutability on which Web3 is built .Being democratized and decentralized, DAO members abide by the opinions and decisions of the majority.

The developers cannot ensure the flawlessness and security of the code which is the foundation of the DAO. Codes may be imperfect and susceptible to hacking.

In 2016, an incident led to the demise of the DAO of German startup stock.it, where the code had loopholes in it for hackers to exploit. They ended up losing $50 million out of the $150 million funds that were raised for the creation of a decentralized version of Airbnb. Although a major setback, instances like this have led to the improvement of technology and increased the security and auditing standards of DAOs.

As Web3 expands and potentially becomes ubiquitous in the future, the DAO has an important role in driving growth and governance systems within blockchain ecosystems. Risks must be addressed and benefits be enhanced to develop superior technology that can give way to optimized user experience, security and scalability within Web3.

Through its pool of specialized talents, Gigster provides guidance on Web3 technology and applications, as well as the technical execution of an enterprise’s Web3 strategies whether it be in blockchain, NFTs, or DAO, among others. If you plan to launch your own DAO for whatever purpose, let Gigster help you better, seamlessly develop and execute your DAO plans, and do away with trial-and-errorBeing democratized and decentralized, DAO members abide by the opinions and decisions of the majority. It may get rid of manipulation, but there is still a risk of conspiracy.
