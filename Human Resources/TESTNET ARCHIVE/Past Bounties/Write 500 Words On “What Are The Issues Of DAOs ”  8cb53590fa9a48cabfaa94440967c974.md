# **Issues of DAOs**

DAO is short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. By definition, a DAO is a program or code-governed organization. As a result, it can work autonomously without a centralized authority.

Now in the sections that follow, we’ll look at actual or potential DAO issues to date.

**Legality:** The legal situation in DAOs is not entirely clear. It is not yet known how different governments will regulate these new organizations. However, the continuing uncertainty of regulatory rules can pose a significant barrier to adoption of DAOs.

**Regular attacks:** The preferred features of DAOs (decentralization, immutability, non-trust) can inherently create performance and security challenges. While some of the potential organizations that could emerge in DAO form are undoubtedly very exciting, DAOs can face many risks that are not available in traditional organizations.

**Centralization status:** It can be said that decentralization is not a situation but rather a range, and different levels of decentralization are more appropriate for different areas of use. In some cases, complete autonomy or decentralization may be meaningless or even impossible. DAOs can allow a much larger community of participants to collaborate than before, but the governing rules set in the protocol will always be a central point. The argument can be made that centralized organizations operate much more efficiently but fail to reap the benefits of open participation.

**Inadequate Infrastructures:**Because Daos are decentralized by nature, they may lack an efficient infrastructure compared to traditional ones. Daos have to design many arrangements and infrastructures themselves before launch, and they are often very different. Reporting, payroll, communication, identity management, and treasury management are all issues faced by DAOs. Doğru altyapının olmaması, bir DAO’nun üyelerini kaybetmesine ve nihayetinde çekiş kazanamamasına neden olabilir.

**Hacking:** The fact that existing codes cannot be easily changed by one person or a minority group has increased the interest in DAOs. However, it also brought with it a structure that could have bad consequences. If there is an error in a code, the prolongation of the process cannot be avoided to intervene in that code.

The problem with The DAO attempt was at this point. In June 2016, a hacker caught a vulnerability in a DAO where he could bypass the smart contract and withdraw tokens multiple times. So he quickly drained all the funds. Founders and investors watched 3.6 million Ether go away at that time. Thanks to this vulnerability, the hacker was able to perform this operation with the rules in the code without any restrictions.

**Differences in Complete Decentralization:** The governance structures in most DAOs are the typical democratic system of one man, one vote. Although there are many advantages in this structure, there are also disadvantages. For example, if the decision to be taken requires expertise, this structure may not be appropriate.

There are certain hierarchies in traditional organizations because having every member vote on every decision would be highly ineffective and potentially disastrous. Let’s put it this way, the people in the structure need to vote on the SEO strategy and the critical actions the team uses. Inexperienced and malicious people can affect decisions in the wrong direction, voluntarily or unintentionally.

Experienced and well-intentioned people are needed to make complex and critical decisions. But this is one of the issues that most DAOs ignore. Namely the human factor.

Joystream DAO was built and continues to be built away from most of these problems. It cares about the most important user experience and listens to the ideas and suggestions of the internal contributors and implements them in the best way. Together with Josytream, you can find the best in this structure and implement your ideas and solutions.
