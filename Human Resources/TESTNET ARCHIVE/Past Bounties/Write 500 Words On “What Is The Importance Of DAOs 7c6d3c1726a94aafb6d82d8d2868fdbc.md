**What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?**A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

**KEY BENEFITS OF DAOs**

1. Operate via a computer code

Whereas traditional organizations are run by specific leaders, DAOs operate through computer code. Blockchain-based governance ensures that no single individual controls the community. So, decisions are made faster in a transparent manner. An experienced blockchain development company can assist you to develop a DAO and incorporate intelligent contracts into it for faster operation.

2. Use of smart contracts

DAOs derive their consensus via digital contracts that exist on the blockchain spine. The virtual contracts are self-executing and contain immutable data that are tamperproof. The algorithms integrate sophisticated data and do away with the requirement for human direction. That said, decision-making through DAO is faster and more convenient. With DAO, you don’t need the physical presence of individuals to vote over an issue. A blockchain developer who is good at ethereum contract development can help you create smart contracts for DAO. The DAO smart contracts have the following information:

Rules and regulations

Guidelines

Functionalities

contract address

3. Instant trust and Transparency

The best thing about DAO development is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe, and open-source blockchain record. Because blockchain ledger is tamperproof, no participant can alter the practices without a majority vote. So, the only role of a DAO entity is to advance the collective interest of a group.

4. Community-based

Unlike traditional organizations, DAOs have an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At DAO development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code. Initially, individuals meet at various social networking sites and decide to contribute funds using ethereum contract development. After collecting funds, the group agrees on achieving its mission as a single entity.

5. Democratization

All members of a DAO can vote on moves and changes, which encourages accountability and careful thinking among members. This creates a flat, fair and equal organization without the hierarchy hurdles. DAO members vote directly to make moves, changes and developments within the organization rather than electing members to make decisions on their behalf.

6. Automation

DAO rules are embedded codes in the blockchain. As the program runs, the rules are enforced without the labor, manipulation, discrimation, or errors associated with human intervention.

7. Removal of Third party institutions

Members can carry out transactions without the help and cost of outside institutions such as regulatory bodies, law practitioners, and other middlemen.

If for example members want to invest in a start-up or change the code of the program they run, DAOs can directly execute these plans via voting and subvert the need for banks, legal counsels and other mediators

## **Conclusion**

Although DAOs may not be a fit for each business, they have multiple features that can make processes in a company more efficient. Transparent, immutable, and trustless smart contracts make the DAO model the best for many organizations. Each day this ethereum development project keeps improving, and its future looks bright. If you wish to benefit from DAO Development, an experienced blockchain development company can help you.
