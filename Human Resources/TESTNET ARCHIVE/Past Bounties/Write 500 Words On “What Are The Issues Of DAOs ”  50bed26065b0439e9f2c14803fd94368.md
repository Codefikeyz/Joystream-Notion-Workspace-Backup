As the world of crypto and blockchains continues to mature, many compelling use cases are naturally being put to the test.

One such opportunity which has recently gained traction is the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. While DAOs show a lot of promise, the approach has both pros and cons like other hierarchies of communication and management.

And in this article will talk about the challenges that the DAO has to solve.

The first problem is security.

Creators of decentralized autonomous organizations can make mistakes in the code that can lead to big losses. A striking example is the story of the emergence of Ethereum Classic. In 2016, hackers found a vulnerability in the code of the Ethereum project’s decentralized autonomous organization — The DAO — and gained access to its money. To solve the problem, the developers organized a hard fork. As a result, the project’s blockchain was split into two chains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (the original blockchain).

Also, under the guise of a decentralized autonomous organization, a fraudulent project can be concealed. Before you decide to enter the DAO, you should study the platform yourself.

Second issue — the decision to develop a project can take a long time.

Particularly, as a DAO scales, getting everyone to vote on proposals in a timely manner can be a challenge. With different time zones and investor priorities, keeping DAO participants up to date and engaged can be challenging.

While there are ways around this, if every decision needs to be voted on by the majority of stakeholders, the extra coordination can be a challenge. Those who choose a DAO as their organization’s business vehicle must be well versed in making decisions based on their specific structure. Especially in a fast-paced Web3 environment, speed is critical in long-term success. Sometimes, having leadership make a decision quickly is the best path forward.

I also want to highlight an important issue of regulation of DAO.

The outline of various disadvantages of DAO would be incomplete without referring to the regulatory concerns. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations can turn out to be regulatory nightmares, especially due to the lack of any definite rules and regulations for taxation and management of DAOs. The common aspect in advantages and disadvantages of DAO points out the critical implications of decentralized governance.

A community-based model not only imposes the burden of an extended transaction time and voting process but also takes away a bit of accountability. How? Isn’t accountability an important advantage of decentralized autonomous organizations? Well, DAOs don’t have any single entity accountable for all decisions of the organization. Therefore, it is quite difficult to implement any rules and regulations for decentralized autonomous organizations.

So, DAO is a new approach to managing an organization that helps overcome the shortcomings of traditional business structures. And despite the inevitable setbacks that DAOs will face over the upcoming years, dozens of incredible projects and businesses have launched using this promising structure.
