**HANDBOOK IMPROVEMENTS**

After carefully going through the handbook I noticed a few areas that might need improvement

1. Accessibility: firstly the handbook itself isn’t accessible to everyone, being that it’s a single document that contains detains on everything about joystream, it should be located in a place easy to find, I didn’t even know such document existed even after watching the on boarding videos and spending time on the discord server, I only found out such document existed a few days ago, being such a big project, presenting newcomers with it at the first introduction would help ease them into the community. Another improvement that can be done under accessibility is maybe making the handbook downloadable, maybe as a pdf file or an ebook, I think people would prefer to be able to refer to it at any given time even when they don’t have access to their computer or internet connection, they can pull it up on their smart phones
2. Size reduction: while researching for improvements that can be made I decided on readin the entire handbook, I fell asleep in the middle of it twice and that too for a voracious reader like myself, now imagine a regular guy who just want to get the basics on the project, he or she would probably give in the first few topics, I think there should be a few things that can be taken out without compromising the message or information, identifying those unnecessary details should make the handbook should make it less scary for people not use to reading.
3. Use of visual effects: most people get bored having to read pages and pages of books unless there’s a juicy story or scandal written in those, on that note I think adding pictures and maybe some of those informative videos included in it or at least putting links to the videos as alternative would be refreshing to readers. Also videos of some processes involved would be quite educational to newcomers, I basically had to have a video chat to one of my recruits to show him how to register for membership even though I gave him links to where he can read about it.
4. Steady updates: I think the handbook is something that should be updated at most weekly, from my research some information hasn’t been updated in months, that shouldn’t be the case, it should be a document to refer to anytime without wondering if what you have is out-dated
