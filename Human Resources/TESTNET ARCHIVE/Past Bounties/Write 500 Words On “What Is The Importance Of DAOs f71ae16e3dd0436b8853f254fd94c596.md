# **What is the Importance of DAOs?**

A decentralized autonomous organization, DAO is often explained as an internet community with a shared bank account. But what are DAOs really, and why are they important? Let’s understand!

Web3 is changing the way people work and redefining how things are done, and DAOs are the vehicle that’s leading that. Humans have always organized themselves in various forms of groups, tribes, teams, or companies to get work done. DAOs are not different from that. DAOs represent a group of groups working towards the same goal with shared crypto wallets or treasuries.

Now, let’s understand why they are important. There are a lot of flaws with the way traditional companies work, and DAOs tend to overcome many of them.

- **Traditional Jobs vs. Web3:** In the conventional world, there is a ladder that you have to climb to grow in your career. While in DAOs, ability matters more than age, and output weighs more than credentials. Outcome matters the most. If you have an idea, go out and build it.
- **Ability to choose what you work on:** Traditional jobs need you to do one thing at a point in time. While in Web3, you get to be everything that you want to/can be. You can be an employee on a project, running another project as a founder, and investing simultaneously.
- **Uniqueness is celebrated:** Being weird/different in the traditional world can make it hard to get a job. While in DAOs, having a diversity of interest is acceptable; what matters is whether you can get stuff done consistently or not.
- **Ownership:** Most of the employees in a traditional company don’t have an equity stake which means that one’s growth potential is financially limited. While in DAOs, if you contribute to a project, you are rewarded with tokens that will grow in value as the DAO grows. Hence, the upside potential to grow financially has no cap, which is not the case while working for a traditional company.

Apart from the points mentioned, here’s a brief comparison chart from [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/#why-dao), which explains the difference well:

Joystream is a video platform and blockchain that is controlled, owned, and managed by its users. Consider Joystream as any other video platform you use, such as Youtube, Vimeo, etc., but it’s on the blockchain. It doesn’t just let you upload your videos to the channel and build up your subscriber count. But it also enables you to sell your videos as NFTs and even create tokens for your channel so that people can invest in you.
