The different phases of elaboration in the blockchain and crypto space have been responsible for prodding numerous new use cases. And among the many openings evolving in this space, decentralized autonomous associations have been gaining a lot of traction.

So, in this article I will tell you about the importance of DAOs and I want to do it through revealing they benefits.

**1.Decentralization**

Whereas traditional organizations are run by specific leaders, DAOs operate through computer code. Blockchain-based governance ensures that no single individual controls the community. So, decisions are made faster in a transparent manner. An experienced [blockchain development company](https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/blockchain-development-how-to-hire-the-right-company/) can assist you to develop a DAO and incorporate intelligent contracts into it for faster operation.

The concept of complete decentralization generally loses value in other endeavors. However, the equation changes in the case of DAOs which rely on collective participation rather than depending on one individual.

**2. Active involvement**

Speaking of community involvement, you can round up on another notable mention among DAO benefits with the active stake of each member. The mechanisms underlying DAOs primarily focus on the idea of allowing members to exert their stake in the organization. First of all, DAO governance tokens imply the necessity for burning or spending the tokens to earn voting rights. Therefore, members are more likely to be considerate and thoughtful of every vote. In other words, governance tokens on DAOs introduce the ability for all users to influence the future of the DAO project.

You should also note that every vote on the DAO blockchain is completely public, thereby ensuring that users are accountable for their votes. For example, a DAO can more likely identify the customers who wish for changes in a product. At the same time, the literal thought behind the design of DAOs ensures a foolproof system. Most important of all, DAOs can prevent spamming of the community with bad ideas.

**3. Community-based**

Unlike traditional organizations, DAOs have an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At DAO development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced Ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code.

In addition, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also reflect how DAO participants can have a sense of ownership. As a result, they can drive members for innovation and set new precedents for financial rewards in return for participation.

**4. Instant trust**

The best thing about DAO development is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe, and open-source blockchain record. Because blockchain ledger is tamperproof, no participant can alter the practices without a majority vote. So, the only role of a DAO entity is to advance the collective interest of a group.
