# **What Are The Issues Of DAOs**

Before we start answering the question of what are the issues and problems of an DAO, we first need to define for ourselves what an DAO is? AАО stands for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation. In simple terms, an DAO is an organisation that is managed by means of computer code and a specific set of programmes. On this basis, it has the ability to function autonomously, without the need for intervention by the governing bodies.

Using smart contracts, DAO can also handle external information and execute commands based on external information, all without the need for human intervention. Basically, such decentralised organisations are managed by a community of stakeholders whose work is stimulated by some kind of token.

The DAO mechanism came to us from free people, from crypto-enthusiasts who believe in equality, transparency, honesty, ease of running projects. State institutions always hamper the development of various initiatives. The DAO is designed to become a tool for acceleration, a tool of trust. After all, as you know, we do not trust state bodies very much. Get into bureaucratic offices, in order to bring your initiative is not so easy. That’s why clever people have created the DAO system. But we have already understood the advantages of DAO, but what are the disadvantages, problems and questions to DAO?

Answering this question, first of all I would like to point out that both socialism and DAO are utopian stories in many respects. Why am I being so harsh? Well let’s be honest, behind any project, even the most decentralized one, there is a team. One way or another this team has a lot of power, a lot of opportunities to influence the so called “decentralisation”. Not that I’m a sceptic, no. I’m just a realist. Let’s imagine a situation where you are one of the developers of a project and you don’t like the decision of, let’s say, the token holders (think of the shareholders). But you have a controlling stake and they have less than 50% and you can manipulate. You can overturn a certain decision that you frankly don’t like. You can change the way the project is run and move away from decentralisation altogether.

Secondly, among the problems of DAO, I would categorise the inability of projects to ensure the safety of their DAO counterparts. Since there is no legal and regulatory framework for FAO, there are no levers to regulate and no levers to protect against hacker attacks. This was clearly demonstrated in 2016, when the first powerful DAO based on Etherium was created by crypto-enthusiasts, led by Vitalik Buterin. And as a result, a third of the funds were stolen. First, it was the largest crowdfunding in the world, and second, it was the biggest hack since the advent of cryptocurrencies. That’s the result of decentralisation and you have to take that into account too.

And thirdly, we can say that decentralized autonomous organization in some way challenges state structures. And as we know, the roller of bureaucracy demolishes everything in its path. And the lack of regulatory leverage on the part of the state may prevent DAO projects from developing to their full potential.

Bottom line:

DAO exists. An example is the video platform Joystream. This young project is already challenging established bureaucratic giants like YouTube, Vimeo and so on. DAO It’s a great alternative to lumbering bureaucratic machines. Stock up on popcorn, Let’s follow this exciting journey called DAO ! We are just at the beginning of the journey! Peace be with you all!
