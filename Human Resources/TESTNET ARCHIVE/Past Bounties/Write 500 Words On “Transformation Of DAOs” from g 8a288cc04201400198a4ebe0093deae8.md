# **Transformation Of DAOs**

# **A Prehistory of DAOs**

“A Prehistory of DAOs” is an essay that Gnosis Guild cofounder Kei Kreutler wrote. As its name implies, this piece traces the DAO’s ancestry from its organizational roots to its digital infancy.

The history of DAOs began inauspiciously in 2016 when Slock.it launched ‘The DAO’ on Ethereum as a way to coordinate investment in, and governance of, a treasury of $theDAO tokens. By the end of the 4-week sale, $150m worth of $ETH had been deposited in exchange for 1.2bn tokens, priced at 0.01 $ETH each. With hindsight, this was an unbearable weight to be placed on such young shoulders: Solidity — the language that TheDAO smart contract was written in — was only a few months old and lacked the documentation and battle-testing needed to be production-ready. On June 17, 2016, attackers used a recursive call to execute a ‘reentrancy exploit ’ and drained 30% of the treasury funds. In the aftermath, the Ethereum community decided to fork the blockchain from block 1,920,000 — a point prior to the hack — and learn from the experience.

I read this last week as a reference while I work on an analysis about CabinDAO. I had to leave out a lot of information to keep it tight, so I’m publishing this blog post to capture ideas from the essay didn’t make the cut. So this post is less of a fleshed-out essay, and more of my notes and thoughts on the essay.

***A short message before we dive in:** If you’re into DAOs, you’ll probably enjoy my weekly newsletter on web3, creativity, and the creator economy.*

This essay reaches into the past and weaves in ideas from cooperative networks and gaming to help us better understand DAOs. The hope is that learning DAOs’ history will help us build a “syncretic theory of organizations” so we can pull from a variety of sources, including culture, historical patterns, and even political and mental biases to build the next generation of blockchain-native communities.

Kreutler, borrowing from [Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/), describes DAOs as organizations where a software protocol sets the rules for how the DAO operates, “placing **automation** at its center and humans at its edges.”

They go on to describe the latest iteration of DAOs as “a voluntary association with the operating principles of digital cooperativism.“ The only difference between DAO contributors and church volunteers is that the former get rewarded in token and the latter in ethereal, congregational brownie points.

Even if DAOs wouldn’t describe themselves as hippie co-ops, they definitely subscribe to the principles of one, particularly when they highlight **member ownership**. One interesting reference in the essay was to the [Rochdale Principles from 1844](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles). Modern cooperatives still use these 7 principles that can serve DAOs, as well:

1. Voluntary and Open Membership
2. Democratic Member Control
3. Member Economic Participation
4. Autonomy and Independence
5. Education, Training, and Information
6. Cooperation among Cooperatives
7. Concern for Community

In the DAO structure, things are typically more visible, meaning all [individual contributions](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290803) are seen and recognized. Individuals that do an outstanding job but are modest and quiet are often not recognized in the traditional company structure as a lot of their efforts go unnoticed.

Everything is visible in Joystream, meaning that individuals don’t get overlooked and they get well-deserved recognition for bringing value to everyone else on the team.

Imagine a workplace where employees are a community of people, where individuals are more self-directed and openly recognized for the work they do. The result is a happier and more productive workforce. If workers have a genuine interest in the company’s success, they will produce work of the highest quality. This culture of fairness and transparency in the workplace is supported by DAO.
