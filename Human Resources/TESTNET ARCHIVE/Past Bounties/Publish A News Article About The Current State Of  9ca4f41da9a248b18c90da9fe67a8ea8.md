**Meaning of DAOs**

Can you imagine a way of organizing with other people around the world, without knowing each other and establishing your own rules, and making your own decisions autonomously all encoded on a Blockchain? Well, DAOs are making this real. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles. Some of today’s internet users and the next generations are looking forward to starting social organizations, searching for an answer to: “How can we exchange values in a trusted environment?” Blockchain enables automated trusted transactions and value exchanges, but even so, internet users around the world want to organize themselves in a “Safe and effective way to work with like-minded folks, around the globe”, according to Ethereum. Bitcoin is generally considered to be the first fully functional DAO, as it has programmed rules, functions autonomously, and is coordinated through a consensual protocol. Of course, not every DAO has been as successful as Bitcoin. In May 2016, German startup slock.it launched the creatively named “The DAO” in support of their decentralized version of Airbnb. At the time it was a great success with a crowdfunding campaign that raised over $150 million worth of Ethereum.

## **Joystream Video Platform**

Joystream is a substrate-based video blockchain that aims to formalize a shared content platform. Compared to the video platforms we know today, Joystream is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is operated and governed by its users. Atlas, the consumer-facing video dApp, lets creators upload videos to their channel, build up subscriber count, enable selling videos as NFTs, or tokenizing their channel, which can help people to engage and share the revenue of the upside.

The main Objective of this article is to update and enlighten you on the current state of Joystream DAO.

## **Current State of Joystream**

The Joystream team are about to launch their final testnet(Carthage) before mainnet.Carthage will be a new chain, where we push as close to mainnet as we can in order to test that everything runs smoothly before launching.The Snapshot for the upcoming Carthage will be on the 14th Of this month September 2022.

Our mainnet will also soon be launched on October 14th through the Contributions of most members of the team.And during this new Carthage some things will be wiped like;

- Channels
- Video uploads
- Comments & reactions
- NFTs
- Proposals
- Bounties
- Forum posts & threads

These will be wiped so that there will be further growth in the project.Any questions about the DAO can also be asked in the next upcoming AMA session.

## **Here i will list some few Advantages of DAO**

**1.Use of smart contracts**

DAOs derive their consensus via digital contracts that exist on the blockchain spine. The virtual contracts are self-executing and contain immutable data that are tamperproof. The algorithms integrate sophisticated data and do away with the requirement for human direction. That said, decision-making through DAO is faster and more convenient. With DAO, you don’t need the physical presence of individuals to vote over an issue. A blockchain developer who is good at ethereum contract development can help you create smart contracts for DAO. The DAO smart contracts have the following information:

- Rules and regulations
- Guidelines
- Functionalities
- contract address

**2. Instant trust and Transparency**

The best thing about DAO development is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe, and open-source blockchain record. Because blockchain ledger is tamperproof, no participant can alter the practices without a majority vote. So, the only role of a DAO entity is to advance the collective interest of a group.

**3. Community-based**

Unlike traditional organizations, DAOs have an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At DAO development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code.
