# **Transformation of DAO’s**

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO’s) unite people of like minds around a common goal or interest. If examined closely, DAOs show how large groups of people can be organized as a decision-making entity ,something that will ultimately disrupt the way businesses work.

DAO’s will have an impact on how businesses are structured and the way individuals lead and are recognized within companies. Ultimately, DAO’s will provide a happier and healthier work environment for all those involved.

Joystream which is an example of a DAO with a transparent treasury and direct democracy of all members is a sovereign digital jurisdiction, which can be funding projects within 5 minutes. DAO’s are not government-subsidized like charities, but what might be added by subsidies can be subtracted multiple times over in time and administration costs. As society grasps just how easy it is to self-organize in this way, we will see a Cambrian explosion of activity that will do for organizations what the internet did for communication.

DAO’s began inauspiciously in 2016 when Slock launched ‘The DAO on Ethereum as a way to coordinate investment in, and governance of, a treasury of $theDAO tokens. By the end of the 4-week sale, $150m worth of $ETH had been deposited in exchange for 1.2bn tokens, priced at 0.01 $ETH each. With hindsight, this was an unbearable weight to be placed on such young shoulders: Solidity — the language that TheDAO smart contract was written in — was only a few months old and lacked the documentation and battle-testing needed to be production-ready. On June 17, 2016, attackers used a recursive call to execute a ‘reentrancy exploit ’ and drained 30% of the treasury funds. In the aftermath, the Ethereum community decided to fork the blockchain from block 1,920,000 — a point prior to the hack — and inarguably learnt from the experience.

DAO’s are still very early on the adoption curve — equivalent to 56k dial-up modems on the internet timeline. This is not just because of how generally alien crypto can be, nor the complexity of choosing a DAO framework — which can be considerable — but in large part because of how legally uncertain the space is. At present, jurisdictions such as Wyoming do permit DAOs to be registered as LLCs but founders still risk the ire of securities laws if they promote a token to unaccredited investors. In theory though, any DAO that manages to fully decentralize all decisions to token holders would hold the same status as Bitcoin or Ethereum: not currently counted as securities by the SEC because of a lack of substantive control by any one person or company. Apart from that (understandable) hesitation on the part of developers to tackle the financial authorities, there are significant technical hurdles to overcome before transactions can be executed entirely collectively and be confidently beyond the scope of securities laws.

Despite these uncertainties, the DAO space is evolving at an outstanding pace. This article can only cover a fraction of the projects that exist and even fewer of the novel used cases that are being built out every day. Aragon began as a dream to increase the iteration rate of governance and we can clearly see that happening today.

# **Developer Collectives**

Developers are tutored in remote collaboration through tools like Github and are the most critical resource for building Web3 infrastructure, so it’s no surprise that developers have been among the first to structure themselves

DAOs satisfy all of the requirements of [purposeful organization as identified by EY Ireland](https://www.ey.com/en_ie/consulting/9-steps-to-become-a-purpose-led-organisation): engaged leadership, integrated purpose, clear communication, aligned incentives, empowered employees, established core values, performance indicators, and belief. DAOs can even use [KPI options](https://blog.aragon.org/kpi-options-the-future-of-daos/) to incentivize performance.

DAO’s are especially useful in areas where the current incentive models are actively working against the goals of society. The best example of this is the realm of intellectual property (IP), which is a veritable ‘dark forest’ of misaligned incentives. Inventive companies can often find themselves challenged by professional ‘patent trolls’, who register large numbers of patents with the sole intention of enforcing vexatious claims, despite not using the patented technology themselves.Implementing a decentralized governing structure means you are giving many people a voice in the company’s future, all of whom have different perspectives. Ensuring the smooth sailing of the platform

In the DAO structure, things are typically more visible, meaning all [individual contributions](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290803) are seen and recognized. Individuals that do an outstanding job but are modest and quiet are often not recognized in the traditional company structure as a lot of their efforts go unnoticed.

Everything is visible in Joystream, meaning that individuals don’t get overlooked and they get well-deserved recognition for bringing value to everyone else on the team.
