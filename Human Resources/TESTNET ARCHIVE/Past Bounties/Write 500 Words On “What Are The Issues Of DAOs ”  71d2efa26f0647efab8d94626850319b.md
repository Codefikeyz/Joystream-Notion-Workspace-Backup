**What are the issues of DAOs?**

A decentralized organization (DAO) is a business structure where control is distributed among team members rather than around a single authority figure. Most crypto currencies are created by decentralized organizations. They are often spread all over the world and work from different locations. Crypto companies operate differently from conventional traditional companies. Instead of one central person, everyone can contribute to the management of the organization. Why do these companies choose this way of working and does this method work well? The DAO can be thought of as a running machine, and the work it is tasked to do is determined by pre-written smart contracts.

A decentralized organization has many advantages over classic traditional business models. Such as: transparency, savings, giving each private owner the right to access and many others. At first glance it may seem that the DAO is an ideal business structure, but in reality the DAO has a number of problems. Below we will reveal all the problems of the DAO.

**Security issue.**

DAOs, like many other crypto projects, are constantly online. This means that they are not immune from hacker attacks that can steal funds from the project or break the system. There are significant performance and safety deficiencies in DAO.

**Legal problem**

The legal status of the DAO is completely uncertain, the formation of a regulatory framework by various state jurisdictions remains in question. DAOs are so innovative that modern legislation could not predict and create regulations for them. At the moment, the DAO is not legally supported by anything.

**Vulnerability in a smart contract**

Quite a serious problem. If mistakes were made when creating a smart contract, then it takes a lot of time to correct them. After discovering a vulnerability, it is necessary to propose a way to fix it to the community, announce a vote and hold it. Only when the participants support the changes, it will be possible to eliminate the error in the smart contract code. If the vulnerability is noticed by fraudsters, they will have time to use it before the end of the voting.

**System imperfection**

It can also be said that the DAO system is not yet perfect. Although, on the one hand, an autonomous decentralized organization does not have a hierarchical structure, therefore, a separate group or a control center cannot make decisions, ignoring the interests of other participants, but at the same time, in some DAOs, those who have more tokens still make decisions, therefore management is very similar to traditional organizations. And decisions are often made by more powerful members of the organization.

**Speed and controversy**

The lack of a clear hierarchy can cause a split in the community and slow down the decision-making process.

In conclusion, DAO allows organizations to free themselves from the shackles of traditional institutions, takes into account a large number of mistakes of traditional organizations, but at the same time, DAO also has a number of its own problems. Instead of a central governing body, all governance rules are automated and guide participants towards the most beneficial outcome for the network. The key to designing good, efficient decentralized organizations like Joystream is to create an efficient set of consensus rules that will solve the complex problems of coordinating the activities of all participants. Correct DAO systems, such as Joystream, take into account all of the above problems and continue to work effectively and develop rapidly.
