# **Write 500 Words On “What Are The Issues Of DAOs?”**

## *Hello to all crypto friends! Let’s continue our conversation about DAO! Today we will talk about the problems and disadvantages of DAO.*

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are created as an alternative to traditional business models that are controlled by a small group of people, and sometimes by one person. This approach has a number of disadvantages, including the inability to take into account the views of all participants in the organization.

However, DAO helps to “hear” everyone’s opinion. Full automation of blockchain systems allows you to simultaneously vote and implement the decisions of the members of the organization.

## **DAO has its drawbacks:**

1. Developers cannot guarantee the security of DAO. The creators of decentralized autonomous organizations can make mistakes when creating the code, which can lead to big losses. A striking example is the history of the emergence of Ethereum Classic. In 2016, a hacker managed to find a vulnerability in the code of the decentralized autonomous organization of the Ethereum project — The DAO — and gain access to its funds. To solve the problem, the developers organized a hard fork. As a result, the blockchain project was split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (the original blockchain).
2. Members of the organization are obliged to obey the opinion of the majority. A decentralized approach to project organization reduces the likelihood of public collusion, but at the same time does not completely eliminate these risks.
3. Making a decision on the development of the project can take a long time. The system is not always able to collect votes quickly. Automated systems lack critical thinking, which means that in the event of a crisis or non-standard situations, they are not always able to properly manage the project.

Thus, DAO is a new approach to managing an organization that helps overcome the shortcomings of traditional business structures. Unfortunately, the developers have not yet created tools that could completely replace the traditional form of managing organizations, consisting of people.

## **Modern DAOs have two problems: limited powers and the fact that control over them is very easy to seize.**

The first problem is the most difficult to solve. Many projects actually manually regulate the “agenda” of the DAO. That is, often the control over the critical issues of project development remains with the team, despite the “cloak” of the DAO.

The second problem is not only related to the proportional voting mechanism (the more coins you have, the more your vote weighs). Even in a situation where each user has only one vote, the DAO can be controlled by a very small number of people.

These problems can only be solved by strengthening the autonomy of the DAO. The more power the community has and the less control the team has over the organization, the closer the decentralized dream will come.

What sounds great in theory doesn’t always work in practice. Let’s start with the fact that people, no matter how wonderful goals they share, do not always know how to negotiate with each other. Experienced managers are often unwilling to leave decision making to the majority. Participants not associated with the DAO by any formal obligations may don’t do your job. Too many discussions can slow down the decision-making process. It is difficult for beginners to understand the structure of the organization and the technical aspects of its work — without proper onboarding, they quickly lose interest.But if the human factor is also present in ordinary companies, then some problems are typical only for DAOs. For example, recognition of the legal status of such organizations by the authorities. In some US states, DAOs are recognized as legal entities, as has been the case in the Marshall Islands since the beginning of this year. A number of other countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Singapore, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Bahamas, Panama) recognize DAO mechanisms. At the same time, the first U.S.-registered DAO, CryptoFed, was unable to formally list the tokens on an exchange after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intervened and blocked the issuance.

In addition, the crisis that hit the cryptocurrency market did not bypass the DAO either. It has become more difficult to attract investments, and the cost of tokens has fallen sharply even for popular projects. At the same time, as evidenced by a number of transactions, investors have not lost interest in strong DAOs: for example, over the past month, [Cabin raised a second round of investments for $2.5 million](https://creators.mirror.xyz/jXkZSB5VIfyeli-yy5P_QT-RjmQWT_UCIaA1I9yXXXI), and [Gnosis Safe, which provides the most popular DAO treasury platform, raised $100 million from investors in July.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gnosis-safe-rebrands-safe-raises-130000225.html)As you can see, along with many advantages, DAO also has disadvantages.
