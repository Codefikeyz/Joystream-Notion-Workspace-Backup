# **History And Achievements Of DAOs**

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is the hottest recent trend in the cryptosphere. This is a new way of managing companies (projects) that provides true decentralization. DAO is a decentralized body (a group of people) that discusses and votes on the most important issues of projects. DAO built on the following principles: Anonymity, there are no territorial boundaries, decentralization, the ability to influence the development of the project, openness, availability.

The organization and rules of DAO operation are prescribed in special smart contracts.

**Let’s take a look at the history of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization**

**The DAO** project is considered the first DAO, which in 2016 raised a record $150 million for its time. This project was based on the Ethereum blockchain and was conceived as a venture fund in which DAO members vote to invest in certain startups. Despite the cool idea, the project ceased to exist as a result of a hacker attack. The scammers managed to find a vulnerability in a smart contract and steal more than $50 million. This incident prompted subsequent DAOs to pay more attention to security issues.

In 2019, the renowned **MakerDAO** project began the process of handing over project management to the community. As a result, the Maker Foundation has transferred all MKR governance tokens to users. The MKR token performs the function of governance — it is used in voting. Each MKR holder has the right to vote and the opportunity to create a new offer.

Thus, MKR holders manage the system and participate in the distribution of profits, but are forced to bear losses if the decisions made are unsuccessful.

A truly large and accessible DAO was created by the **Uniswap** project in 2020. This fall, the protocol distributed Uni tokens, which are governance tokens, to all its users. This allowed a large number of people to take part in voting on the most important issues of Uniswap. The success of this protocol finally popularized the DAO, which began to be created in many projects. We can say that Uniswap created the DAO exactly in the form in which we see it now in various projects.

In 2021, [**the Joystream project**](https://www.joystream.org/) has taken the idea of DAO even further. He initially launched the selection of the most active members of the community in the DAO called Founding members and allocated part of the funds for this. In addition to the standard issues of distribution of funds, the DAO of the project organizes elections for positions in working groups. **In my opinion, this is currently the most developed DAO system.**

**Conclusion**

DAO is a new form of company governance that provides true decentralization. This form first appeared in 2016 and, despite being innovative, had security problems due to vulnerabilities in the smart contract. However, as time went on, more and more attention was paid to security issues, and the DAO form gained more and more popularity. **Now many large projects are moving to DAO and this is a real trend.**
