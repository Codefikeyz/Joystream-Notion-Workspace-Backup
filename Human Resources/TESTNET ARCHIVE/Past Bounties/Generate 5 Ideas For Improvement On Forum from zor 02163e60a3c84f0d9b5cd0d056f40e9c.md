1. I am writing this article for the second time since the first one was deleted after trying to copy a line in the text. Be sure to fix this bug. It is very difficult to restore what has already been printed earlier.
2. Make a user rating system for which additional rewards will be issued. By showing users what they can get for their work in this way, the community will be more active.
3. Create an algorithm that will find plagiarism, this will allow you to leave only the highest quality content in the community.
4. Make it possible to add images to the forum. Users themselves will create interesting and unique content for you, give them maximum opportunities for this.
5. Add a reward for more invited users. You will get a great community expansion rate.
6. You should divide the forum into an open part for all users, and a closed part in which the project admins will check tasks and improvements, so you get rid of people who just want to speculate on other people's ideas
7. Discord admins respond for a long time, make quality support, hire another admin or assistant to the current one. This will greatly speed up the development of your community.
