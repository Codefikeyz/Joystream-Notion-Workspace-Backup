# **Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

Joystream is like a decentralized Youtube.The first decentralized online video site! Why he is better than other video platforms?

As we know, YouTube removes a lot of different videos that a lot of people don’t like it. Therefore we need decentralization of Joystream. Also Joystream aims to give videocreators alternative ways to monetize their videos that is amaizing!

Has fast evolving apps for consuming content and governance activities. The main goal of Joystream is that media platforms are accountable to the people they impact, which are primarily their users, be it as consumers, creatives, third party developer or workers.

He is a video platform controlled, owned, and operated by its users! That are a significant plus. The Creators can mint their videos as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain, and each channel has its own native token. Unfortunately, due to network effects, there’s effectively a monopoly on video distribution and monetization.

The problem with a monopoly on the distribution of ideas is that if you as a creator are unfairly censored or demonetised, or consumer are unhappy about some aspect, such as the algorithm, you are unable to campaign for change with any success, and you also cannot leave for a better alternative.

There are 2 dApps built on Joystream you should understand: Atlas, and Pioneer.

# **Atlas**

— is a video platform, similar to ones you are familiar with, but with new and exciting opportunities to monetise.

There are 2 new exciting ways for creators to monetise their work.

# **Video NFTs**

— creators can list any of their videos for sale as an NFT, using 3 different types of auctions English (predefined end date), Open (no predefined end date), and “Buy now” (auction concludes immediately upon a bid matching apredefined asking price). NFTs can also be sold on the secondary market, where the creator can also be earning royalties on sales.

# **Creator tokens**

— In Atlas, creators can issue their own Creator tokens, this allows creators to align their most passionate community members around the future creative activities of the creator and the community, by pooling the resources of the community and sharing the upside. This is particularly impactful for creators with an ambitious plan for growing the scope and scale of their activities before they have garnered a big audience.

By sharing the upside, the community members become natural evangelists and collaborators on making the creator as successful as possible in the future.

# **Pioneer**

— is our state-of-the-art governance app, which has been built with one goal in mind: allow Joystream to be a fully functioning decentralized autonomous organization. This means we’ve had to build features that most other DAO governance apps do not have, such as our on-chain forum, in-depth proposal system, and working groups structure.

We see a future where lots of brilliant people are coming together and working on the evolution of Joystream, in a fully decentralized fashion.

The future of work, Joystream DAO is a hierarchy of people getting together to build the future of video!
