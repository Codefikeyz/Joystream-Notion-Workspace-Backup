# **What is the importance of DAOs?**

The DAO explanation comes from the name itself — “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”. It is a form of organization that is autonomous and decentralized.

The DAO can be used for almost all forms of collaboration like partnerships between individuals as well as cooperation between companies.

The biggest driving force behind DAO is a change in how we all live and work toward independence and self-determination. Whereas full-time dependent employment was “normal” in the past, free labor is increasingly common in the world of work today. Whereas the person’s radius of action was severely limited to office duties in the past, at least some part of the work can be done from anywhere today. Whereas it was perfectly normal to buy and own things in the past, the usage is more important than owning a product today. All of these changes require and promote collaborative and participatory structures, from which the idea of the DAOs was born. Joystream working groups are an example. We work for the DAO in these groups remotely.

Currently, the DAOs only exist in the cryptocurrency world. They are mostly used to coordinate the cooperation of individuals. But the principles of the DAOs represent a big opportunity, particularly for companies. The companies can often only provide services online, because of trends such as the sharing economy and the growing demand for connected services instead of individual products. However, there is a danger of platform monopolies dominating the market in the platform economy, because of data aggregation and the associated information asymmetry. The DAOs can offer a counter-model for this with their approach to mapping collaboration, which is not controlled or dominated by either participant or the operator of the digital collaboration solution.

The DAOs are taken for granted in the cryptocurrency world today, but they are hardly ever discussed outside of the cryptosphere. The DAOs must be understood not as a fixed construct (with blockchain, smart contracts, etc.) but as a way, if we want to change the situation. The attempts to find some new forms of collaboration are becoming more widespread, regardless of the means used. There are still some obstacles to overcome until it becomes the new order. As for me, the important aspect of working at Joystream is workflow. There is a clear structure for assignments, interaction rules between participants. And these aspects are very important for the real sector corporations.

There are also technical and social complexities that need to be solved. For example, it is not technically easy to lay out complex sets of rules in code. However, there are already mechanisms in place to create DAOs without extensive knowledge of blockchain for less complex issues. For example, we discussed the technical feasibility of streaming on the Atlas platform during the AMA session. And as a result, it would be very problematic to do this. At the same time, creating the conditions to attract creators is not a difficult task.

Social complexity is the biggest challenge on practice. Openness and active participation are required for all participants. The initiators of the cooperative or ecosystem must create incentive and control systems that are sustainable over the long term. Members must be willing to actively participate in its development once a cooperative is established. Such cooperative systems do not emerge overnight. Defining, creating and legally establishing the cooperative organization based on a common goal, that is a journey worth taking.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of the DAOs develop in the cryptosphere nowadays. The DAOs have enormous potential and influence on the development of the structure of ecosystems in the long run. But there is still a lot of work to be done before the DAOs can find application in the real sector.
