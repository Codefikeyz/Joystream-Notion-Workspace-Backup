# **History and achievements of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1374/1*i1wmZj6V57cCtwJp2nC8OA.png)

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that is managed through smart contracts. DAOs have no traditional hierarchy. They work transparently, according to the rules prescribed in the code. Joystream is a classic example of a decentralized autonomous organization. Therefore, Joystream users need to know the history of the formation and the main advantages of DAOs.

The concept of DAO (first name — decentralized autonomous corporations, DAC) was born in 2013. The key principles of DAC were:

- **the decentralization of companies,**
- **the tokenization of their shares,**
- **the openness of transactions with publicly verifiable code.**

Over the time, the community has refined the idea and adapted it to any organization of people with or without a profit motive. This is the concept of modern DAOs.

Blockchain can be seen as the basic infrastructure for building a DAO. In other words, a decentralized autonomous organization is an application deployed on the top of an existing network. For example, Joystream is similarly deployed on the Polkadot network.

In 2016, one of the first DAOs ever launched was called “The DAO.” Investors invested more than 14% of all circulating ETH at the time in it.The goal of The DAO was to create a community-driven venture capital fund that would invest in projects based on voting. We can see that the fundamentals of the DAOs governance by voting were established at the very beginning of their formation. Joystream also wasn’t an exception to the rule. Joystream’s council members are elected by voting.

However, just three months later, hackers hacked The DAO and stole $60 million in funds. Although this experiment with the DAO was unsuccessful, it opened the door for the development of decentralized communities.

**What are the achievements of the DAO?**

According to Messari’s latest report, one of the trends in the crypto industry in 2022 is DAOs. Over the course of the year, we may see a restructuring of such organizations, the emergence of subsidiary DAOs, and a new distribution of roles among participants. Autonomous decentralized organizations will have better collaboration tools, which will enable the community to get rid of passivity and become more efficient. DAO tools will help them do this. This is a trend we can see throughout the existence of Joystream.

DAOs are moving toward formal recognition. In April 2021, Wyoming passed a law recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations as a new form of company. A few months later, the first DAO was approved. But in November 2021, the SEC suspended the token registration of the first legally recognized organization, saying it had provided “misleading information” to potential investors.

In 2021, a wave of investment DAOs appeared in which token holders could invest their money in NFTs, Web3 projects, cryptocurrencies or other DAOs. An example of such an organization is Joystream, which allows video makers to monetize their work through the Atlas platform.

I would like to **summarize** that today’s DAOs have a fairly substantial background and the history of development. As platforms continue to develop and improve, DAOs could launch an era in which everyone is a consumer, an employee, and a manager of disparate decentralized firms. I am convinced that Joystream will play an important role in this direction.
