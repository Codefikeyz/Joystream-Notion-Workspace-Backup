# **History And Achievements Of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dPutM1xDmuk5PfPABC08xA.png)

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is one of the most interesting and progressive concepts that has been implemented using Blockchain technology. The transactions and rules of the DAO are encoded on the blockchain and run through smart contracts, thus eliminating the need for any central authority. The absence of such centralized management of the organization thereby transfers control over the project to users or investors of the project itself.

The idea of a DAO is relatively not new. In the spring of 2016, several members of the Ethereum community announced the start of work on The DAO project, also referred to as the Genesis DAO. And although the open source platform itself was developed by the Slock.It team, it was nevertheless called DAO. The platform proved to be very successful, as it managed to raise 12.7 million Ether (at the then exchange rate of about $150,000,000) and this made the DAO the largest crowdfunding in history.

Basically, the platform allowed anyone with a project to submit their idea to the community and be able to get funding from The DAO. Anyone with DAO tokens could vote on plans and then be rewarded if the projects were profitable.

However, despite a serious development team, The DAO was hacked on June 17, 2016. Within a few hours of the attack, 3.6 million ethereum was withdrawn from the protocol, which was more than $70,000,000 at that time. This became possible due to the fact that the smart contract first sent funds to ETH, and only after that updated the internal balance indicators. However, it is important to understand that the problem did not arise from the vulnerabilities of Ethereum itself, but from the vulnerabilities of one particular application that was built on the Ethereum system.

It was this hack that marked the beginning of the end of The DAO. To return the lost funds, Ethereum held a hard fork, and token owners were asked to exchange their coins at the rate of 100 DAO for 1 Ether. However, this did not save the situation. Many exchanges have delisted DAO tokens. The fatal blow was the ruling of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), published on July 25, 2017. This report says:

“The tokens offered and sold by the “virtual” entity known as the “DAO” were securities and therefore subject to federal securities laws. The report confirms that issuers of securities based on distributed ledger technology or blockchain technology must register offers and sales of such securities, unless an existing exemption applies. Persons participating in unregistered offerings may also be held liable for violations of securities laws.”

In other words, the DAO offering was subject to the same regulatory principles as companies going through the initial public offering process. According to the SEC, The DAO violated federal securities laws along with all of its investors.

However, despite the fact that The DAO project has closed, his idea lives on to this day and is used by a lot of developers. One example is the Joystream DAO.

Joystream DAO is an open source blockchain media platform that solves the problem of inflexible monetization, censorship of speech, unfair distribution of profits between content creators and audiences. It also increases the level of innovation and trust in third-party developers.

The Joystream team believes that media platforms must be accountable to the people they influence, whether they be their end users, content creators, third party developers, or staff members. The lack of such a form of reporting is the root of the problem that Joystream solves. Such theses are very much related to Joystream with The DAO, since the main goal is the maximum decentralization of the project.

I hope that the Joystream team will take into account the experience and mistakes of The DAO and be able to build a truly high-quality platform that will work and delight users for many years.
