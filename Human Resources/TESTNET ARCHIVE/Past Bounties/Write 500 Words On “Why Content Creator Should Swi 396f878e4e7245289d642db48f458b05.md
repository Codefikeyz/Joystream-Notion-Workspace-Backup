Atlas is an application for publishing and creating content. In fact, it is a media player, an analogue of YouTube, but with its own advantages and disadvantages. You can also download it on your phone or watch it from your computer’s browser, subscribe to channels, watch it, leave comments, and you’ll get native tokens for watching content, which you can then sell or share with the owners of the channels you watch and want to support.

The product is built entirely in the open, so all of our assets are public and transparent, and all assets exists under permissive licenses.

Atlas is primarily meant to show current and prospective community members what Joystream can enable as a platform. It, and in particular the deployment of it on the joystream.org domain, is not intended to be a value capturing asset for Jsgenesis the company, unlike the role of youtube.com or the YouTube mobile app for Alphabet. This is a very important, and perhaps unfamiliar, distinction between products in the Joystream project, and traditional startups.

Now, and in the immediate future, Atlas shows community members and creators what the system can enable in terms of familiar and unique Web3 features. The Jsgenesis instantiation also shows the state of the current creator community and content selection.

It serve as a base template for others to build their own product offerings on top of Joystream. This innovation is uniquely unlocked by the open permissionless infrastructure of a blockchain system, and a forthcoming subsystem called the gateway system which provides a built in business-model for developers and entrepreneurs to build their offerings on top of the Joystream system.

The Atlas web app itself has a relatively conventional web stack for purpose, perhaps with the exception of relying on an external extension for key management, as is customary for web applications in Web3. The much more important aspect worth understanding is all the different infrastructure pieces and roles interact to make Atlas a working product.

So, personally, I recommend to join this community and start doing simple actions to earn the first tokens. And since the project is built on DAO, as soon as Joystream is equal in popularity to YouTube — these tokens will be worth good money.
