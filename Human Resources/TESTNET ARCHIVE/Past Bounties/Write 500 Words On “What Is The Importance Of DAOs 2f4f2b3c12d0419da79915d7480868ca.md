***500 WORDS ON THE “IMPORTANCE OF DAOs”***

The acronym **DAO** which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization is an entity with no central leadership it gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clear evident answers to your doubts.

**DAOs** isn’t associated with any country as a means to ensure total decentralization. Basically, the developers of the first **DAO** aims at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds

**DAOs** doesn’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business and entity is vested upon the group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the **DAO** benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals. Multiple DAOs with popular examples such as Curve DAO, Maker DAO, and of course Joystream DAO have encouraged many developers and business owners to opt for DAOs.

DAOs operate through computer code. Blockchain-based governance ensures that no single individual controls the community. So, decisions are made faster in a transparent manner, for instant in Joystream DAO proposals are put up in front of the council to vote on and approved before any final decisions are made, this council in turn are voted in by the founding members.

There is also some kind of mental advantage in joining DAO. Since you are part of voting powers, you feel more inspired to contribute for the community, There will always be need for system changes and new ideas implementation as time goes by,also Joystream is at the stage of testnet were everyone can contribute to the community in other to get a perfect team and project.individuals can suggest some changes or updates regarding the project.

Another importance of DAO is that it’s less human dependent. Functions of of the community are embedded in blockchain through series of programs and smart contracts. As long as they are satisfied then function of the system is fulfilled without human intervention.

The best thing about DAO development is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each

other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe, and open-source blockchain record. Because blockchain ledger is tamperproof, no participant can alter the practices without a majority vote. So, the only role of a DAO entity is to advance the collective interest.
