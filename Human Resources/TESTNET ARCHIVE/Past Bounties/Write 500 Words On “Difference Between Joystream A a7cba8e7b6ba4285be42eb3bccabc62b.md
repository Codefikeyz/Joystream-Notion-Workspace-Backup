# **Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

Today, new initiatives in a variety of fields emerge on a daily basis, and the world is increasingly going online and setting up next metaclasses.

Before examining how Joystream differs from other DAO systems, let’s first look at what Joystream is.

One of the pioneers of our upcoming web 3.0 is Joystream. The fact that it is a DAO-driven video platform implies that there are numerous opportunities to get involved with the project and earn money by making contributions.

As a cool new alternative to Youtube, Joystream enables content creators to produce content and immediately monetize it.

What benefits does this video platform offer, then?

We are all aware of YouTube’s severe video content filtering policies and how frequently films are removed from the site. Users won’t tolerate that, so we can address this issue by decentralizing Joystream.

Additionally, the Joystream video platform has the fantastic goal of giving video producers other options for monetizing their works, which is a huge plus!

Making media platforms accountable to its users, whether they are customers, creatives, third-party developers, or staff, is Joystream’s primary objective.

The ability for artists to design their own tokens and have their video mining take the form of non-functional tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain is the second important advantage.The decentralized nature of digital currency is one of its main advantages. This indicates that they are scattered over numerous computers, networks, and nodes rather than being under the jurisdiction of a single entity like a government or central bank. Virtual currencies frequently make use of this decentralized nature to attain levels of anonymity and security that are not typically accessible to regular currencies and their transactions.

In the Web 3.0 age, DAOs represent a new kind of collaboration.

Organizations no longer have a corporate hierarchy, and any member is free to express their opinions regardless of their status, level of education, or identity.

The majority of DAOs differ from one another in a number of ways. A project based on videos and a new organizational structure are both present in Joystream DAO. Videos can also be mined as NFTs because Joystream DAO uses the Atlas platform to produce video-based NFTs.

Another distinction is that the Joystream DAO also recruits members for its working groups and has a structured makeup of various working groups with leaders and alternates.

Votes within the DAO are submitted via blockchain and are viewable by anyone. Users must conduct themselves as they feel fit because their votes and decisions will be made public. This promotes good deeds for the voters’ reputation and discourages bad deeds for the neighborhood.

**There are two ways to monetize your videos on the Joystream platform:**

1. You are able to design your own tokenBy issuing their own tokens in Atlas, video artists can rally the most ardent supporters of the community to support their ongoing creative endeavors and the community as a whole, pooling resources and splitting earnings. This is crucial for creators who have big scaling goals before they amass a sizable following.
2. You can produce your videos as NFTs.Video producers can place bids on any of their videos utilizing one of three forms of auctions for NFT sales. English (with a deadline), Open (without a deadline), and Buy Now (auction ends as soon as the bid matches the predetermined price). NFTs can also be purchased on the secondary market, where the creator may be compensated with royalties.

Community members become natural supporters and partners in optimizing the creator’s future success by sharing the rewards.
