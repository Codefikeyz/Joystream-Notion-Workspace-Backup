# **What are the issues of DAOs?**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are self-governing organizations with a decentralized structure. That is, management is organized by the community and users themselves. Organization operations are undertaken from a specific set of rules that is encoded in a smart contract.

As a result, DAOs eliminate the need for intermediaries to run an organization. DAOs depend on collective organizational decision making through decentralized governance.

# **The advantages of such a system include:**

- **autonomous structure** — centralized organizations face some management problems due to the top-down structure. DAO, with the help of an autonomous structure, ensures the independence of each member of the organization.
- **equal conditions for all DAO participants** — absolutely any DAO participant can submit their ideas for improving the protocol. It is also important that everyone in the DAO can see new proposals and ideas and vote for them.
- **neutrality of DAO** — at its core, DAO is a smart contract that has a certain set of rules written in the code. Once the smart contract is deployed, the DAO takes care of these rules without any outside intervention. Thus, a guarantee is provided for predetermined actions occurring at the right time.
- **transparency and accountability of the DAO** — every action in the organization is recorded in the blockchain forever and can be checked by any user at any time.

# **Cons of DAO**

- **concentration of votes** — the governance of the DAO is highly dependent on the ownership of the project tokens. Thus, a certain investor or group of investors can accumulate significant amounts of tokens and vote for unreasonable proposals. Therefore, despite the principles of decentralization, the DAO still does not completely eliminate the problems of hierarchy.
- **transaction time** — DAO voting mechanisms take time, so you may have to wait quite a long time for some decisions to be made. For example, it is necessary to urgently eliminate the identified vulnerability in the code, however, this is impossible without the consent of all members of the DAO. As a result, time is lost to address urgent security vulnerability issues. However, DAO Joystream has tried to solve this problem. In Joystream, any decisions regarding project management are made by Consuls, who receive payment for voting. The presence of pay should incentivize Consuls to vote faster and accept or reject as many decisions as possible.

- **regulatory implications** — The lack of any specific rules and regulations for taxing and managing DAOs makes decentralized autonomous organizations very difficult to regulate. In addition, the DAO model implies that the organization does not have a single person responsible for all decisions of the organization. Therefore, it is rather difficult to implement any norms and rules for decentralized autonomous organizations.
- **DAO code vulnerability** — Most DAOs focus on the idea that the smart contract code will take care of their security, however it is now clear that every code is vulnerable and even DAOs can deploy code with certain vulnerabilities. Thus, the code that manages the DAO can be a serious obstacle to its growth in the future.

# **Outcome**

When using DAO, both positive and negative aspects should be taken into account. In fact, most of the disadvantages of DAO are due to the advantages of DAO, such as decentralization and transparency. For example, the community-based model is responsible for limiting the speed of transactions and the time required to transmit urgent offers.

However, over time, developers successfully address some of the shortcomings of the DAO model and you can see many improvements in DAO design in the long run.
