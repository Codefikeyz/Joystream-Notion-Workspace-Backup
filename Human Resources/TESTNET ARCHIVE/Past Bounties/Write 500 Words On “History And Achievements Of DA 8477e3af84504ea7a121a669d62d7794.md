# **History and achievements of DAO**

Decentralisation is at the heart of creating a cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto, while creating the world’s first cryptocurrency called bitcoin, laid the foundations for decentralisation. Many crypto-enthusiasts happily picked up the decentralisation theme . Further this theme has only evolved more and more. So, let’s dive a bit deeper into the main points of the emergence of DAOs (digital decentralized autonomous organization).

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are peer based organizations that work via smart contracts. The financial transactions are encrypted in a blockchain, and this effectively eliminates the need for a central management apparatus .

Satoshi Nakao gave the impetus to all of us, which was picked up by other active people, one of them being Vitalik Buterin, the founder of the Etherium network. He and other crypto-enthusiasts decided in 2016 to create DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation on the Etherium blockchain platform. This project was conceived as an automated venture capital fund, as the largest crowdfunding platform, managed by artificial intelligence based on the Ethereum blockchain and using a smart contract system. According to the intention of the creators, investors themselves would have to vote on the platform for different projects that are looking for investors.

Fraudsters had spoiled the launch of the project by stealing a tidy sum of money because of a network vulnerability. But in time, developers have corrected this mistake. He who does nothing makes mistakes.

But despite the scammers who spoiled the idea of decentralization, the topic was and is still developing today.

Here are some well-known GAO platforms and projects:

Ethereum was one of the first platforms to implement a smart contract capable of functioning fully autonomously. Although Ethereum lacks complex mechanisms to manage the platform, it was its smart contracts that formed the basis of DAO platforms.

MakerDAO

One of the first platforms to launch the DAI staplecoin, which is pegged to the dollar. The peculiarity of DAI is that you can use ETH cryptocurrency and some tokens to generate tokens, unlike USDT.

Uniswap

It is widely regarded as the leading automatic market maker (AMM). The Uniswap platform combines the functions of a crypto-exchange and DeFi-protocol. Which allows any user to become a liquidity provider.

Compound

Another one of the largest lending protocols in DeFi. Compound charges COMP tokens to lenders to encourage the community to lend more crypto loans. The project also charges interest on loans issued against the cryptocurrency. COMP tokens allow their owners to decide on changes to the Compound protocol. This is the basis of decentralisation.

Dash

The Dash protocol was one of the first to introduce the concept of masternodes (supernodes) to the industry. These nodes have increased authority over conventional and full nodes, while at the same time being a point of centralisation for the platform.

And, of course, a revolution in the world of video is the Joystream platform.

Joystream is a video platform that is controlled, owned and operated by its users. That is, the hallmark of the platform is decentralisation. There is no single owner, we are all owners. Everyone has a say and can improve or change things. Also, you can not just watch videos, but you can encourage people who create content on this platform. Content that you like, that you watch. And of course, the differentiating quality of Joystream from YouTube is that none of the videos will be deleted at the request of a third party. That’s the thrill of decentralization. The truth, whatever it may be!
