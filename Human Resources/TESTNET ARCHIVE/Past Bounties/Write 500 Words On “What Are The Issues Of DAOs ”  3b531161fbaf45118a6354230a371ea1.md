# **WHAT ARE THE ISSUES OF DAOS?**

Because they are purely digital and decentralized, DAOs are often lacking a well-developed and efficient infrastructure. Many DAOs have to design their own tools and infrastructures before they launch, and most of these tools are rather ‘quirky’. It is difficult for DAOs to gain traction without the right infrastructure for reporting, treasury management, governance, payroll, communication, and identity management. Many DAOs will lose members without the right infrastructure. The Web3 space, however, is gradually helping to solve some of these problems through innovation and collaboration.

It is Wyoming’s intention to solve this problem by enacting the Wyoming Limited Liability Act, which lets DAOs operate like LLCs. According to this act, smart contracts govern DAOs. Other states or countries may follow Wyoming’s example. Other firms have proposed other legal approaches to regulating DAOs. The current crypto ecosystem, however, is the only place where DAOs can operate freely, since attempting to move outside can be highly regulated.

DAOs are governed by a democratic system of one man, one vote. Although this structure has many advantages, it may not be the most effective way to manage corporations actively, especially when expert decisions need to be made. In traditional organizations, hierarchies are in place because getting all employees or members to vote on decisions is highly ineffective. A large token holder with inadequate experience can negatively influence decisions in an organization. People with experience are needed to make difficult and technical decisions. Many DAOs did not anticipate the challenge. ENS DAO, for example, navigates this problem by ensuring members vote in qualified and experienced staff to handle critical decisions transparently. This compromises the decentralized vision of DAOs and may face strong criticism from hardcore web3 enthusiasts.

Inactive token holders can disrupt a DAO’s functionality. In addition to the issue of delegation, as mentioned above, it also poses the issue of centralization. As a means of resolving this issue, some DAOs are using incentives to reward active token holders and punish inactive ones.

DAOs are going to have a tough time figuring out how to get the right governance fix. The approach adopted by different organisations will be crucial.

In spite of DAOs’ potential, some critics argue that many of them are just a bunch of relatively rich. In contrast to what DAOs are supposed to represent, a large number of DAOs are currently financed by venture capitalists. While many DAO proponents claim that DAOs will replace venture capitalists by focusing on decentralization and community, venture capitalists are beginning to fund the DAOs that should replace them.

However, VCs can assist DAOs in navigating the legal terrains and challenges they may face in the physical world with the help of their operational expertise. In the article published by Coindesk, the author emphasizes that DAOs of today combine a community-driven ethos with venture capitalists’ deep pockets and operational expertise.

Conclusion

It is clear that DAOs are not as rosy as they appear on the surface. Even though some DAOs have given investors positive returns, DAOs are not typically investment properties. Instead, they facilitate effective coordination in a decentralized environment without much trust. While the problems and debates on this issue continue, Joystream DAO is trying to offer a solution to people by bringing freedom to video broadcasting, which is under the control of politicians and the wealthy, with its DAO built on video publishing, and by establishing the DAO infrastructure that allows people to direct their own business with their own decisions.
