# **What are the issues of DAOs?**

DAO is an acronym that means “decentralized autonomous organization”. It is a structure where there is no central authority that runs the system without consulting the common participants. In simple terms, all members of the ecosystem have the same rights and can participate in the management of this organization. Joystream is also a decentralized autonomous organization. Thats why I would like to show some disadvantages of DAO in this article to be prepared for some risks connected with these issues.

We are all aware of the prospects and benefits of DAO. But what is the other side of the coin? What could be the disadvantage of such a seemingly progressive system?

**The main issues of DAO are:**

- **the legal uncertainty;**
- **the questionable efficiency of the ecosystem;**
- **partial centralization;**
- **data protection.**

One of the main disadvantages of decentralized autonomous organizations is **the legal uncertainty** that can obstruct their functioning and slow down their development. Since the crypto industry is not properly regulated at this stage, unlike the banking sector, with all the ensuing consequences, DAOs can exist and develop quite successfully. But since the crypto industry tends to be transparent and regulated in the legal dimension, this may become a significant barrier to further development of decentralized autonomous organizations.

The next problem for DAOs is **the questionable efficiency of the ecosystem**. On the one hand, if we talk about global structural changes, DAO is superior by all parameters to the outdated inflexible bureaucratic system, which requires a huge amount of resources and time just for its maintenance. On the other hand, a decentralized approach can harm the system in the short term, if not be useless at all. Let us consider an example when there are no initiative participants in a decentralized system, in which case the DAO will be lacking new ideas and the opportunity to develop. And as we know, the absence of development is degradation.

The next problem is **partial centralization**. Any system is created by a small group of people who write the rules of the system. I mean, centralization is initially implicated in any decentralized autonomous system. But this problem is not so significant compared to the previous challenges, because it can be solved quite simply, if the opportunity is provided to make changes to these rules by participants of the system.

And in my opinion, the last important problem of decentralized autonomous organizations is **data protection**. In general, the properties of DAOs such as decentralization, immutability, trustworthiness involve significant disadvantages in terms of performance and security. While the potential of DAO is impressive, the system has many risks that are not present in centralized organizations. For example, hackers can monitor the presence of errors in DAO not only to fix them, but also to misuse those errors for their own purposes.

**I would like to summarize:** decentralized autonomous organizations have significant development potential and a lot of advantages. But if we look deeper, there are also many problems and errors of DAO. They can be structured according to their importance and influence, starting with legal uncertainty and ending with initial centralization. As we all are the part of Joystream, we should take on consideration these issues. The main aspect of these problems is that the simplest problem can have far greater consequences than it could have caused. That is why we do not forget about all possible risks and try to minimize the impact of such problems on the development of Joystream as the decentralized autonomous system.
