Dear [name and surname/nickname],My name is …..

I am reaching out to you on behalf of Joystream council. [Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/) is a decentralized video platform and blockchain. It's powered by the native $JOY token. There's also the video dapp [Atlas](https://play.joystream.org/) using the underlying Joystream blockchain, where you can upload videos to your channel, build up your subscriber count, sell your videos as NFTs, and even create your own token for your channel so that people can invest in you, and those token holders can earn a share of the revenue you generate, get early access to your videos, and all sorts of cool things that you control.

We are eager to develop a lasting partnership with you, believing that it will bear fruit for both of us. We would like to meet you with our Joystream council.

The meeting will give you an opportunity to know more about Joystream and create your own crypto blog.  Please let me know if such a partnership is of interest to you or if there are any questions. I'll be happy to provide more details.

Regards, [name], Joystream Community & Partnership Manager
