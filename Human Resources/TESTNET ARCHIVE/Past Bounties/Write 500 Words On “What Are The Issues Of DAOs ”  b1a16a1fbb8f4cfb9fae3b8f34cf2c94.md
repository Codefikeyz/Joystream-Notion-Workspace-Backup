# **Issues With DAOs**

A DAO or Decentralized Autonomous Organisation that is programmed on a distributed database is a relatively new concept — and thus since it is in an evolving space — it’s only natural that there would be problems. With regard to DAOs like Joystream-the best minds in the business are working on them and innovating as we speak to solve them. Some of the problems are the following :1. Risk of being Hacked: Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security. Many Protocols have been attacked and lost millions of dollars -for example, the case of Badger DAO which lost over 100 million.

2. Not Totally Decentralized: In many DAOs, selective topics are put to vote for example creation of a token is decided by community vote but the price of the token is unilaterally decided. Other such Information, despite the tenet of DAOS being full transparency, is withheld by the Founders, etc from the community.

3. Legal Issues: DAOs are not yet fully recognized in a legal sense. In fact, currently, there are only two states in the United States that do formally recognize a DAO as a legal entity with limited liability: Wyoming and Vermont. For the rest of the states, as well as most legal jurisdictions outside the USA, there are legal questions around DAO ownership and liability.

4. Poor engagement from the community: Without community engagement, you’re losing out on the core benefit of decentralizing in the first place: crowdsourcing wisdom and discernment. The building of a Community is integral to the success of a DAO.

5. Actual Discovery Of DAOS: How do you actually discover a DAO that resonates with you? So there needs to be a user-friendly directory that not only shows the different DAOS but what kind of activity is going on, Who are the people involved so that people can choose a DAO at the very outset which is on their wavelength and with which they share a vibe.

6. Onboarding DAOs: These can be a little overbearing and complex for a lot of people. I believe it should be an easier and more seamless process. Once onboarded, DAO core teams must decide on how to manage talent, which can be tricky in a flat structure, and even more loaded when an organization is trying to establish itself as highly decentralized.

7. Bounties: Many DAOS run bounties that compensate one and make many do the same task — this can be very frustrating for a lot of people and manywill just not attempt to do a task. Moreover, a lot of unnecessary man hours are being wasted.

Having said all this, we need to remember that not All DAOs are created equally so how each DAO approaches these issues will be different and will reflect the interest and value of its members .thus, we can conclude that as our world becomes smaller and we are able to connect with people across the world faster and more deeply, DAOs surely will represent a paradigm shift in how individuals organize themselves.
