what @JoystreamDAO is about, we are a decentralised video platform powered by the native joy token, this simply means that users and participants are part owners, by holding the joy token you are an official founding member of Joystream and can contribute in decision making

Introducing atlas.. atlas is the state of art video app @JoystreamDAO created that let's you upload your videos, grow your subscribers list, and even create your own token so the holders gets part of the revenue generated from your videos

Ways to become a founding member of @JoystreamDAO

Joining the council (board of directors)

Joining a working group (departments)

Work on defined bounties(contracts)

Making your own bounties

Explaining the concept of the council, the council is @JoystreamDAO equivalent of board of directors, they are voted by the token holders so once you are holding the joy token you can vote on who's in the council and can also apply to be a member

working groups are @JoystreamDAO equivalent of departments, there are different working groups for different tasks and each group is led by a working group lead just like a manager check out the working groups on our site to know which you're suited for

the concept of defined bounties, these are sort of one off tasks that @JoystreamDAO, like a gig in which our integrators put up a task with defined time of completion and the reward, a participant can accept the bounty, fulfill the task and if it's done properly receives reward

Did you know you can find a need that we didn't know we had, propose it to us, solve them are get really reward for it, check out our platform for anything you think will be useful to Joystream then propose it on the "new bounties" channel on discord

The decentralised nature of @JoystreamDAO separate us from others, problems like political disagreements, content sensorship, non alignment of purpose between the video creators and the people running the organisation doesn't exist as the users are practically owners too

Did you know you can earn millions in tokens by referring talents to @JoystreamDAO, that's right, for every active creator you refer to Joystream there's a reward to it, basically anything they can do, chances are there's someway that service can be useful to Joystream
