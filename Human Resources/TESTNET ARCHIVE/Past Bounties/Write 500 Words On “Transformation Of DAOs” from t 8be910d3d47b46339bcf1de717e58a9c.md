# **Transformation of DAOs**

As people around the world self-organize into the DAO, we will see the DAO do for organizations what the Internet has done for the world. The most famous DAOs are Uniswap, BitDAO, Joystream and others.

The DAO was born in 2016 when the first DAO, creatively named TheDAO, on the Ethereum network was launched as a way to coordinate investments and manage the $theDAO token hoard. But as we know, the DAO has not remained as a niche project, it has become a philosophy of running organizations around the world and is taking over it just like the Internet did in its time.

Yes, DAO is young, he is an elementary school student and can only dream of what he will become, but many predict a great future for him. We will look into this future with you.

# **Let’s look at DAO using the example of one of the most successful representatives — Joystream and their Atlas platform.**

## **The freedom of action**

As the DAO proliferates, instead of one employer and a 40-hour work week, we could spend a few hours a week on multiple DAOs. Monotonous work will be automated, allowing participants to become more free and allow them to spend more time on valuable activities and creative solutions.

## **More opportunities for decision making**

You can get an idea of the decisions that DAO members are already voting for, both within your organization and within another, because all protocols are open and available to all users. You will be able to monitor the number of participants, the speed and the desire to vote in favor of a particular decision. And most importantly, you will be able to influence what is happening on your own, rather than delegating authority to a politician in your district.

## **Bonuses for all DAO members**

While the DAO probably has a set of core contributors who perform activities on an ongoing basis, the DAO also generates tasks for all contributors, be it “chat message moderation” or “article writing”, for which the community will receive fiat currency. , or community tokens, or maybe both.

## **Work from anywhere**

As many traditional managers with obvious trust issues continue to hide behind a “team cohesiveness” mask, sending everyone back to the office after the pandemic, the DAO not only doesn’t care where you work, they also don’t care. when you work or what you look like when you work — in fact, many members are only recognized by their NFT profile pictures.

**DAOs create a shift in internal leadership**A traditional business structure appoints managers to take control of teams and as their title implies, manage people. Within the DAO structure, there is less people management. Seeing that they can no longer direct others by force, individuals need to educate, influence and motivate others. This ensures everyone feels informed enough to make decisions and galvanizes support around a given proposal that is being voted on.

This means that strong leadership skills will be critical for gathering support and having an influence in the community, similar to what we see in other democratically-run

Undoubtedly, there are many more positive aspects in the implementation of Tao, and they will appear with time and the development of DAO communities.
