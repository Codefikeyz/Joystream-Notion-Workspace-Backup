1- Member Notification System would be a good improvement:A memner notification system would be a good improvement, when some reactions happen to a members post, member can be notified via poineer so member can easily navigate and see what reactions made.

2- Archived Forums Tab:Search fonctions on the forum archive is not detailed and not working properly… For detailed search fonction, we can add category search and replied posts search options. These would be usefull.

3- When we first click the forum tab, it shows us the categories of forum, but it can be much more usefull if we show last forum topics insted of categories. when person click on the forum tab , can see some interesting topic and may want to enter the conversation.

4- Ranking System for Members:A ranking system for forum users can make them motivated to speak more…They can want to rise up their ranking points. More they get higher ranks, more pople can listen what they say about the topic they discuss. Also high ranked members can rise their audiences, more people can follow them on social medias and maybe watch their videos on atlas if they have a channel.

5- It looks we have limeted the categories of forum. We should enable the fonction that members can create new category. This freadom of speach may rise some good categories and speaches. A freedom of speach can improve our DAO further.
