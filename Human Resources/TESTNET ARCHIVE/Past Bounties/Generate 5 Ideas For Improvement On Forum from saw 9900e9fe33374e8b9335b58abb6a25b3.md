Ideas for improvement on Forum

Running the Joystream community or forum isn’t easy. The natural tendency for forums is to start strong when everyone is new and excited, but to dwindle over time as people lose interest and move on. So to keep the excitement on, I’lld like to recommend a few improvements.

1. Create an onboarding process for Joystream forum

If you want people to participate in Joystream community, you have to hold their hands and show them why it’s so important to you.

The best way to do this is with an “onboarding” process for new members. The goal is to create a series of touch points (probably an email campaign) that tells people why the community is important and guides them through creating a profile and posting their first message. An “introduce yourself” forum is a great place for people to start.

If you can, give people hard numbers. For example, we know that people who participate in our forums are more likely to succeed at building a business, and more likely to earn higher incomes from their businesses than people who do not participate in the forums. Basically, tell your new members what’s in it for them.

2. Create a guided video course about how to use Joystream forums best

Most forum software packages have advanced features that are key to getting the most out of participating in a community. Notifications, search, private messaging, signatures and other features might seem self explanatory to you, but many people have never used forums before.

You’ll also likely have unique forum features and sections you build in over time. We have sections for progress logs and finding mastermind group partners, for example. You’ll want to explain these sections to people so they know why they matter and how to use them.

A guided video course is a great way to do this, and it doesn’t have to be difficult to create. All you need to do is record your screen and voice, explaining the different features of the forums.

3. Encourage progress logs or other types of forums that require regular interaction

A real life progress log in Joystream.

A progress log is a great way to hold yourself accountable and get feedback from other people about what you’re working on.

This type of forum is great for building activity and engagement in the community. Create some kind of section for ongoing threads, where people are reporting on something over time. A daily or weekly progress log would be a great way for members to record and share how they’re doing.

4. Spend time in the community yourself

This one might sound simple, but you might be surprised how many people expect to install forum software and poof! have an active community just spring up without any additional work.

In the beginning especially, it’s absolutely crucial that people feel like it’s worth their time to participate in the forums. When someone posts in the forums and doesn’t receive a reply, it’s like the community gets a little cut. One cut doesn’t matter too much, but if this continues, the forum will eventually suffer death from a thousand cuts.

5. Promote members of the Joystream community to special positions

Eventually, a handful of members will stand out as leaders and daily active contributors. A great way to reward and encourage this behavior is to recognize it in front of the whole community.

You want members to take ownership of the community when possible. It ensures your long-term viability.( Although this idea is already being applied in Joystream, i just wanted to add it as an extra. XD) .
