# **“History and achievements of DAOs”**

**What is DAOs?**

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

Joystream is a typical example of DAOs and one of the best that I’ve seen so far.

**History of DAOs**

The [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) computer code behind the organization was written principally by Christoph Jentzsch, and released publicly on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), where other contributors added to and modified the code. Simon Jentzsch, Christoph Jentzsch’s brother, was also involved in the venture.

The DAO was launched on 30 April 2016 at 01:42:58 AM +UTC on Ethereum Block 1428757, with a website and a 28-day [crowdsale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding#Software_value_token) to fund the organization. The token sale had raised more than US$34 million by 10 May 2016, and more than US$50 million-worth of[*Ether*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether_(value_token)) (ETH) — the digital value token of the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) network — by 12 May, and over US$100 million by 15 May 2016. On 17 May 2016, the largest investor in the DAO held less than 4% of all DAO tokens and the top 100 holders held just over 46% of all DAO tokens. The fund’s Ether value as of 21 May 2016 was more than US$150 million, from more than 11,000 investors.

As of May 2016, The DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all [ether tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ether) issued to date.

On 28 May 2016 the DAO tokens became tradable on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

A paper published in May 2016 noted a number of [security vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_vulnerability) associated with The DAO and recommended that investors in The DAO hold off from directing The DAO to invest in projects until the problems had been resolved. An Ethereum developer on GitHub pointed out a flaw relating to “recursive calls”. On June 9 it was blogged about by Peter Vessenes, founder of the Blockchain Foundation. By June 14, fixes had been proposed and were awaiting approval by members of The DAO.

On June 16, further attention was called to recursive call vulnerabilities by bloggers affiliated with the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3).

On June 17, 2016, the DAO was subjected to an attack exploiting a combination of vulnerabilities, including the one concerning recursive calls, that resulted in the transfer of 3.6 million Ether — around a third of the 11.5 million Ether that had been committed to The DAO — valued at the time at around $50M. The funds were moved into an account subject to a 28-day holding period under the terms of the Ethereum smart contract so were not actually gone.

Members of The DAO and the Ethereum community debated what to do next, with some calling the attack a valid but unethical maneuver, others calling for the Ether to be re-appropriated, and some calling for The DAO to be shut down. Eventually on July 20, 2016, the Ethereum network was [hard forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_fork) to move the funds in The DAO to a recovery address where they could be exchanged back to Ethereum by their original owners.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)#cite_note-25) However, some continued to use the original unforked Ethereum blockchain, now called [Ethereum Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic).

In September 2016, [Poloniex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poloniex) de-listed DAO trading pairs, followed by [Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(company)) in December 2016.

**Achievements of DAOs**The ultimate achievement of a DAO is its community.

This is where DAOs get interesting. They allow us to redefine community values in a way today’s organizations do not. They do so in three3 different ways.

1. People participate in it of their own volition. They do so because they have shared goals, principles and motivations, and a belief on how they should become actions. In case of diverging opinions, another DAO can be created as they have low costs of entry. Put another (*dumber*) way, DAOs are reiterations of sociobiological kinship models on a meta level.

2. As mentioned, a DAO is defined by its objective. This in turn gives some value to its token. Depending on the DAO’s ambitions, said tokens might be worth more to some people than to others. This allows us to redefine value in a way that is untied to classical financial theory. The token might be worthless outside the community, but the community might not care. If we push this idea to the extreme, we’re seeing glimpses of self-governing communities, working on and for their own version of capital.

3. Tokens are more than just capital. They also allow stakeholders to own a part of the community they participate in. They also have hedonistic value. I’m a fan of rugby. I’ve spent hours advertising the beauty of my team on Twitter, and watching games, ensuring the players get a salary, thanks to advertising. It would be great if I could own a tiny portion of my team based on my involvement and could thus participate in decisions related to it. As mentioned above, that token would be useless to someone who isn’t a fan. But it would matter to me.

Of course, all this requires a certain level of trust between stakeholders of all types, lest a token be pumped then dumped, leaving well-meaning fans holding the bag. This is particularly interesting, given that the primary argument for DAOs is that blockchains remove the need for trust. But we, as they say, live in a society.
