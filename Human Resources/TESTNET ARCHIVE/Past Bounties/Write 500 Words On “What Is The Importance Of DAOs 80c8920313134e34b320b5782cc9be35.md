# **“What Is The Importance Of DAOs?**

Before exploring the importance of DAOs, we need to define what an organisation is. An DAO is a decentralised, autonomous organisation that is governed by smart contracts. Smart contracts are responsible for voting, financial management and workflow functions.

Interest in DAOs, among the cryptocurrency community, is growing every day. Investors are pouring millions of dollars into development , and people are quitting their stable jobs to go into the unknown. The unknown attracts, doesn’t it?

Well, the very concept of DAOs was invented by the founder of EOS, Dan Larimer. Vitalik Buterin, in his turn, developed the idea and expressed it in the original Ethereum white paper:

“The general concept is that a virtual organisation has a certain set of participants or shareholders who, perhaps by getting a majority of 67% [of votes], have the right to spend its funds and change the code. […] The methods of distributing DAO funds can range from fees and salaries to more exotic mechanisms like using internal currency to encourage performance. This essentially replicates the legal attributes of a traditional company or NPO, but using blockchain technology.”

But the term DAO should not be confused with the infamous The DAO project. That project was a decentralised venture capital fund that was launched in May 2016 and raised $160 million in crowdsales. But fraudsters took advantage of bugs in the project and stole almost a third of investors’ money, which significantly undermined faith in the project. There are reports that people are still trying to get their money back.

All in all, all DAOs can be roughly divided into eight groups according to their area of interest — from DeFi protocol management to investment and NFT collection.

Infrastructure;

protocol;;

service;;

social;

investment;;

grantmaking;

communities of collectors;

media.

Today I would like to touch on the last group, namely the media and the importance of using DAO in this direction. In the age of censorship, prohibition and total control of information, states sometimes prevent the dissemination of information they do not like. And DAOs platforms like Joystream are created to remove all these bans. Joystream community also allows any member of the community to collectively influence certain decisions within the platform. Joystream allows you to reward topics and videos you like, thus motivating members to create better and more interesting content.

Bottom line: freedom is very important to us crypto-enthusiasts. It is in the freedom, in the autonomy, in the decentralization that we can create something new, useful, revolutionary. It is impossible to create under the control of controlling authorities. Any creator, creator, scientist reaches his full potential when there is no censor, no state apparatus over him. Therefore, the boundaries of proliferation of DAO are changing and evolving, so we will see even more variants of decentralized organization of people in the future. Socially oriented structures are more dynamic in this respect, because they rely on social interaction of users. Yes, there are also some risks in implementing FAO, but the benefits are enormous. If we learn how to use decentralisation properly, we can open up enormous prospects for the future.
