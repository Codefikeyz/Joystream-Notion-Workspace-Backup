# **What Are The Issues Of Dao’s ?**

Discription:Organizations across many industry verticals will benefit greatly from DAOs in the future. According to DeepDAO, there are already over 216 DAOs in the market with about 10 billion in assets under management (AUM) and around 2 million members across them.But we must acknowledge that problems often arise when we start resolving trust issues with automation. While automation provides efficiency, it is usually not the authority in complex matters.There will be a learning curve in getting the balance right. And after all, Rome was not built in one day. And while automation will solve many problems in our society, we should still have faith in human integrity — while being aware of its weaknesses.

Issues:

Since most of DAOs’ members are usually anonymous, compliance with AML/KYC policies is very complicated, if not impossible. Also, because DAOs can include individuals from around the world, multiple jurisdictions´ laws are at play. Deciding which country´s laws apply can be difficult and is likely to result in legal battles if a dispute arises. To limit any money laundering risks, DAOs should use one of the AML/KYC providers to verify member’s identities, but it can be difficult to find reliable providers.Blockchains may almost be impossible to hack but the smart contracts that run on them do not completely share the same level of security. A series of attacks have hit many smart contract networks, draining some protocols of millions of dollars. For example, the first DAO known as “The DAO” is a typical example of the impact of such vulnerabilities. A more recent event is the $120 million hack of BadgerDAO.Since DAOs are purely digital and decentralized, they often lack a well-developed and efficient infrastructure their traditional counterparts enjoy. Many DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’. DAOs suffer from having the right infrastructures for reporting, treasury management, governance, payroll, communication, identity management, etc. Without the right infrastructure to handle these duties, many DAOs may lose members and eventually fail to gain traction.In many regions of the world today, DAOs battle with regulatory issues such as taxation of DAO tokens, treasuries, and investments, how to get insurance on investments, implementing AML and CFT policies, and who takes responsibility for a DAO’s actions. Without a clear system to solve these legal challenges, it’ll be hard for DAOs to gain ground in the physical world.

Conclusion:

However, these challenges show that DAOs are not all rosy as they seem to be on the surface. While the governance tokens of some DAOs have given investors good ROI, you should know that DAOs are not typically investment properties. Rather, they are means of effective coordination in a decentralized environment without the need for much trust and believe.DAOs have to design the right tooling and infrastructures by themselves before launch, and a bulk of these tools are quite ‘quirky’.DAOs of Joystream will be purely digital and decentralized,so they will hae the some issues but with the web3 developing furute, they will be solve by the members of the DAOs, not by e centeralised organisations.
