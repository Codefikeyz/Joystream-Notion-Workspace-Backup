Pinpoint Your Niche

First off, you need to [pick the perfect niche](https://www.tastyedits.com/how-to-find-the-perfect-youtube-niche-for-your-channel/) for your ATLAS channel.

Most successful content creators **focus exclusively on one topic** or one kind of content. No matter if that’s fashion, healthy eating, yoga, gaming, or product reviews.

You need to do the same. Even if you have a huge number of ideas for fantastic videos, it’s essential to **pick your focus carefully**.

Craft Your Brand Identity

Next, you need to **create a brand identity**.

Sounds pretty corporate, right? And in a way it is. To become a successful content creator, you need to **think of your channel as a kind of business**, and make a few strategic **design decisions**.

In terms of your brand identity, that means carefully thinking about your channel’s **name** and aspects such as your **logo, banner, and intro- and outro-sequences**.

The ultimate goal here is to **make your channel memorable** and instantly recognizable if it shows up in someone’s recommendations.

Set Up a Solid Content Creation Schedule

If you want to keep up that kind of pace, you need to [plan your content](https://www.tastyedits.com/how-to-plan-your-youtube-content-the-best-tools-and-management-strategies/) **in advance**.

Finally, you need to **promote the hell out of your videos**.

Waiting for your audience to discover you is one way to go — but it’s going to take a while. And that’s not least because many hesitate to watch channels with a very small audience. That’s also why it can be a good idea to hide your subscribers on ATLAS, at least to begin with.
