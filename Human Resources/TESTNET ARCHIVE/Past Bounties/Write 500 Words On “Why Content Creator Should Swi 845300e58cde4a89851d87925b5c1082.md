# **What Is a Creator?**

What is a creator? Don’t worry, this isn’t a philosophical think piece about religion and spirituality. We’re talking about content creators here. You’ve probably heard the term before, but what does it actually mean? Who counts as a creator and what is it that they do?

Content is vital to creating a strong online presence for your business and it can really make a difference to your bottom line. For instance, marketers who put effort into blogging are 13X more likely to see a positive ROI from their marketing efforts (HubSpot). And, according to Oracle, [content marketing](https://influencermarketinghub.com/linkedin-content-marketing/) generates 3X more leads per dollar spent.

# Now who’s a Content creator?

A content creator is a person or group of persons that produces entertaining or educational material that caters to the interests and challenges of a target audience. The content he/she produces can take many forms, including blog posts, videos, ebooks, photos, and infographics. Today, businesses employ content creators to engage new and existing customers on the brand’s behalf.

Whether you work on a [content marketing team](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34064/How-to-Cultivate-a-Content-Culture-at-Your-Company.aspx) at your company or you’re [riding solo](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-you-should-write-your-own-content), there are some tried-and-true habits you can adopt that will put you on the path to being a truly successful content creator.

Content creators can create both online and offline content, but in this article, we’ll be focusing on digital content creation.

Experienced content creators know that your brand’s content has to align with your brand strategy and [match your brand’s voice](https://influencermarketinghub.com/5-examples-of-branded-content-done-really-well/). These creators are well-versed in creating performance-based content that will help your brand build trust, authority, and credibility while reaching the ultimate goal of generating more sales or conversions.

# **What are the different types of content creators?**

Creators cover a wide range of platforms, channels, and approaches to creation. We’re going to cover 4 broad types of creators:

- Web content creator
- YouTube creator
- Podcast creator
- Social media creator

# **🌐Web Content Creator**

When we talk about web content creators, we’re referring to those who use written content like landing pages, blog posts, sales copy, and more. These creators could be generalists who work across content types or they could be specialists who opt to write only a specific type of content.

Each type of content has its own purpose, but at its core, written content is intended to inform and educate readers about a product or service, share why it’s useful and how to use it, and push the reader towards a conversion (either directly or indirectly). Most of the time, creators [repurpose content](https://influencermarketinghub.com/6-places-you-should-be-repurposing-your-influencer-content/) into other types of content to generate more leads and interest.

Here are a few [types of content](https://influencermarketinghub.com/types-of-content-marketing/) that web content creators might work on:

## **Blogs**

Blogging is the most common type of web content. Businesses use their blogs to improve SEO and increase the chances that their site will be found in web searches for relevant keywords. Blogs can also be monetized using on-site ads or [affiliate marketing](https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-affiliate-marketing/).

## **Checklists**

Checklists are user-friendly content that creators use to provide step-by-step instructions or easy to follow guides for readers about a specific process. Presenting complex processes in a checklist makes it feel more approachable and increases the likelihood that readers will be able to successfully complete a task.

## **White Papers**

White papers are typically longform content that’s used to provide detailed information to potential customers as well as to set up the writer (or their company) as an authority on a subject.

## **eBooks**

Similar to white papers, eBooks are another type of longform content that provides value to your audience. While white papers can be used as sales tools, eBooks generally are not. Instead, they’re used to provide value and build trust.

## **Case Studies**

Case studies are another common type of web content. They feature a specific client who has enjoyed success with a business’s products or services. This is done by revealing the real-life application of a product or service. Case studies are a form of social proof that show potential customers the successes that your customers are having with your products and services.

# **▶️ YouTube Creator**

YouTube started in 2005 as a collaboration between 3 former PayPal workers and has grown to be the second-largest website on the internet, after Google. YouTube is also the second-largest search engine on the internet, again, after Google. It’s become the go-to platform for video content creators and there are several [YouTube influencers](https://influencermarketinghub.com/top-25-youtube-influencers/) who have made a name for themselves on the platform.

YouTube creators vary widely in the topics they cover, how they integrate into the YouTube community, and the way they approach content creation. Here are a few things to consider when looking to [become a YouTube creator](https://influencermarketinghub.com/how-to-become-a-youtuber/) or trying to find one for your brand:

## **Size**

YouTube channels managed by YouTube creators range from single-digit subscribers to subscribers in the tens of millions. What really matters for YouTube creators is having an active account. This means posting regularly and engaging with your viewers consistently.

## **Channel Focus**

YouTube creators can either be the star of their shows or run things from behind the scenes, but it’s most common for YouTube creators to be on-camera.

## **Production**

While some YouTube creators have production teams with writers, editors, animators, and marketers, most YouTube creators take those roles on themselves, producing, recording, editing, and promoting their own content.

## **Partnerships**

Many YouTube creators seek out partnerships with others on the platform as well as with brands and sponsors.

So, basically anybody can [create a successful YouTube channel](https://influencermarketinghub.com/how-to-create-a-youtube-channel/), but it’s certainly not easy. YouTube has [more than 2 billion monthly active visitors](https://influencermarketinghub.com/social-media-statistics/), 50 million of which are actively creating content. More than 500 hours of video content is uploaded to the platform every single minute. This makes the platform ridiculously competitive. But, given that YouTube has paid out more than $2 billion to YouTube creators over the years, the platform clearly understands the value of YouTube influencers.

And people love YouTube creators. In fact, 75% of Millennials prefer watching YouTube to watching television. This is, in part, because 70% of YouTube subscribers find YouTube creators to be more relatable than celebrities. Given that most YouTube creators are the faces of their channels and working with small teams or solo, this shouldn’t come as a surprise.

There are few things that have changed the way we engage and communicate with each other the way [social media](https://influencermarketinghub.com/social-media/) has. According to We Are Social, there are more than 3.4 billion active social media users who spend nearly 2.5 hours on [social media platforms](https://influencermarketinghub.com/social-media-sites/), browsing and messaging every day (GlobalWebIndex).

Social media creators, broadly known as [influencers](https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-an-influencer/), are great at building up engaged lists of followers. This makes them the perfect vehicle for sharing your marketing messages.

The type of content social media creators actually create will depend on the platform they favor. [Instagram influencers](https://influencermarketinghub.com/top-25-instagram-influencers/), for example, tend towards beauty, health, fitness, and fashion because Instagram is such a visual platform. This makes it really easy to show off the beautiful imagery typically involved in those industries. Twitter, on the other hand, is an excellent platform for bloggers, politicians, comedians, and news sites due to its primarily text-based nature.

Here are a few of the different types of content social media content creators produce:

- Articles, blog posts, guides, eBooks, and more
- [Images](https://influencermarketinghub.com/best-image-sizes-for-social-media/)
- Videos, including video Stories and live videos
- [Infographics](https://influencermarketinghub.com/infographic-tools/)
- Testimonials and reviews
- Contests
- Announcements
- Holiday content
- [GIFs](https://influencermarketinghub.com/gif-marketing/)
