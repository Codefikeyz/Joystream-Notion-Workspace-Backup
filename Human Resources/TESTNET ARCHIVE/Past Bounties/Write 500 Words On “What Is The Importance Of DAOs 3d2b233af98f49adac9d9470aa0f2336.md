What are the Importance of DAOs?

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs), sometimes called a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC) is an organization constructed by rules encoded as a computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the organization’s members and not influenced by a central government.

Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

Joystream is a decentralized platform for streaming and sharing video content governed by DAO. The main goal of Joystream is to focus more on content creators, creatives and also consumers. With fairer reward distribution, censorship resistance and immunity to interventions by global entities.

[Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/) is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. In comparison to known video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its users

DAOs leverage Blockchain for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

DAOs don’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business and entity is vested in the group of supporters or members of the organization.

In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals

Major Importance of Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

Decentralization

The foremost highlight of the advantages of DAO focuses on decentralization, an essential trait of decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs focus on achieving the maximum extent of decentralization according to their basic design principles. The concept of complete decentralization generally loses value in other endeavors. However, the equation changes in the case of DAOs which rely on collective participation rather than depending on one individual.

With the pros of DAO in decentralization, members of an organization can express their voice for the organization’s future. Many of you may point out that DAOs are not completely decentralized due to the DAO tokens. How? Well, members with more DAO tokens are likely to have more voting privileges. However, the voting power is distributed significantly more in comparison to traditional organizations with centralized leadership.

Community Involvement

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs introduce the facility for communities all over the world to connect with each other and work on productive goals together. Anyone can enter the world of web3 with just an internet connection and governance tokens of a DAO.

Participation in DAO delivers the unique value advantage of contributing to new projects such as creating new domains like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or new play-to-earn cryptocurrencies

In addition, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also reflect how DAO participants can have a sense of ownership. As a result, they can drive members for innovation and set new precedents for financial rewards in return for participation.

Active Stake in the Game

Speaking of community involvement, you can round up on another notable mention among DAO benefits with the active stake of each member. The mechanisms underlying DAOs primarily focus on the idea of allowing members to exert their stake in the organization. First of all, DAO governance tokens imply the necessity for burning or spending the tokens to earn voting rights. Therefore, members are more likely to be considerate and thoughtful of every vote. In other words, governance tokens on DAOs introduce the ability for all users to influence the future of the DAO project.
