This article or Blog was inspired by **JOYSTREAM**

Joystream is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. In comparison to known video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its users.Web 3.0 is focused on ownership of user’s data. The most valuable data are of course the financial data. But what about other relevant things, such as movies, songs, poems, articles, games, or performances? Do they have a place in the incoming upgraded version of the web? They should have because they are forming the society and all their members. The financial and ownership part of those is still underestimated in today’s web 2.0 centralized solutions

Joystream is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. In comparison to known video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its users.

Web 3.0 is focused on ownership of user’s data. The most valuable data are of course the financial data. But what about other relevant things, such as movies, songs, poems, articles, games, or performances? Do they have a place in the incoming upgraded version of the web? They should have because they are forming the society and all their members. The financial and ownership part of those is still underestimated in today’s web 2.0 centralized solutions.

What is Joystream?

Joystream is a decentralized platform for streaming and sharing video content governed by DAO. The main goal of Joystream is to focus more on content creators, creatives and also consumers. With fairer reward distribution, censorship resistance and immunity to interventions by global entities.

There are various different active roles in the Joystream:

Validators

They check the validity of new blocks, propose new ones and participate in the consensus process for committing new blocks to the chain in the PoS.

Council Members

Participants in the voting process — they vote for new proposals. Council Members are voted for a limited period.

Storage Providers

Videos, images and other content media are not stored on the blockchain due to the amount of data. Storage and distribution nodes take care of those. The main role is here for Storage Lead, who is voted by Council and takes care of hiring, firing and management of Storage Providers.

Content Curators

Monitoring newly published content, verification of data validity and ownership. In their heart could be elected Content Curator Lead, who then hire other Curators.

Content Creators

Crucial position within the Joystream. Content Creators make and publish new content on the platform and monetize it.

There are some upcoming roles, such as Membership Screener, Membership Curator, Bandwith Provider, Discovery Provider, Live Streaming Provider, Builder and Communication Moderator. We will give you information about those once they will become active.While the rules of other DAOs are established by a core team of community members through the use of smart contracts. These smart contracts lay out the foundational framework by which the DAO is to operate. They are highly visible, verifiable, and publicly auditable so any potential member can fully understand how the protocol is to function at every step.

Once these rules are formally written onto the blockchain, the next step is around funding: the DAO needs to figure out how to receive funding and how to bestow governance.

This is typically achieved through token issuance, by which the protocol sells tokens to raise funds and fill the DAO treasury.

IN CONCLUSION

Today’s web 2.0 is broken and corrupted. Content creating platforms serve their owners and not to its users. By creating Joystream, users will have a fair chance for the monetization of their video content and at the same time, they can use the advantage of staking JOY tokens. And the most important thing from the decentralized point of view is the governance management system of Joystream, which will be fully under the control of Joystream DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). And that is, what matters in Web 3.0!
