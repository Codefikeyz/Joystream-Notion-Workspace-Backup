# ***What are the issues of DAOs?***

Today I would like to talk about DAO, or rather about their problems. Although this technology is one of what awaits us in the world of the future in the next ten years, it also has its drawbacks compared to the technologies of the past and present. Despite the fact that DAO is the future, there are already leading companies in this sector such as Lido Dao, Uniswap and Joystream.

I’ll make a reservation right away that in this article we will not analyze what DAO is, there is a lot of information about this on the Internet, we will immediately move on to the topic.

# **Downsides of the DAO**

The first negative, to which the business community reacts extremely negatively, is the lack of secrets. Yes, if in a large company entire departments are created to develop mechanisms for protecting information, because everyone wants to keep the “secret of the company” and have a competitive advantage.In the case of DAO — it is open source and you can easily go to look at the smart contract code and understand how it all works.

The second minus — is the lack of centralized regulation by the authorities of different countries. Simply, one DAO participant can be located and operate in a country where the technology is allowed to be used, and the other, on the contrary, is located where it is prosecuted by law. And if in both cases the algorithm is understandable, in one place you can do DAO, but not in another, then what to do in countries where the rules are not defined remains a mystery.

The third minus is probably the most “dangerous” of all — these are hacker attacks. Due to the transparency of the source code, people with evil intentions can watch it, as it was, by the way, with the first and largest hack of the DAO, when more than 20,000 thousand users collected an amount of $150,000,000, and a hacker cracked the code and stole 50 of them.

Modern DAOs, such as Joystream, are more attentive to security and there is practically no possibility of hacking in them.

# **DAOs force absolute transparency**

I’m sure having an organization’s decisions and work recorded on blockchains for all to see has loads of advantages. But I can also see two immediate downsides to pursuing transparency at all costs.

Firstly, linking a wallet to a DAO means that anyone and everyone can see every transaction made with that wallet. Put another way: imagine if all your co-workers could see every transaction going in and out of your bank account because that is also the one your company sends your salaries to. This would lead to chaos. One could solve this by having different wallets, but that seems like a hassle we don’t have today.

Secondly, and more importantly, the nature of DAOs means that their stakeholders are vulnerable to off-chain coercion. Crypto proponents are primed for scams. They often showcase poor judgment, low social literacy, high tolerance for risks, and are highly persuadable. It makes them perfect targets for social engineering schemes. This can be used to influence decisions, and perhaps gain control of a DAO and its millions.

The ability to identify individual contributors on blockchains may also invite unwelcome individual consequences for work done on behalf of the DAO, which in turn may discourage the kind of risk-taking that may lead to technological breakthroughs.
