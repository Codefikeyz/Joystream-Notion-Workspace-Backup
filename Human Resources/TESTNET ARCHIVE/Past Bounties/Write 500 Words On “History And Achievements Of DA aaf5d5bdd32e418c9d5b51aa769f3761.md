500 words on “History and achievements of DAOs

DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, which is very important for everyone, which is managed through smart contracts. DAOs don’t have a traditional hierarchy. They always work transparently, according to the rules prescribed in the code. Joystream is a classic example of a decentralized autonomous organization. Therefore, Joystream users need to know the history and main advantages of DAO.

The DAO concept was born in 2013. Key principles :decentralization of companies,tokenization of their shares,openness of transactions with a publicly verified code, so there is no catch.Over the years, the community has refined this idea and adapted it to any organization of people for profit, but this was not the main thing for them. This is the concept of modern DAOs.

Blockchain can be seen as the basic infrastructure for building a DAO. In other words, a decentralized autonomous organization is an application deployed on top of an existing network. For example, Joystream is similarly deployed on the Polkadot network.

In 2016, one of the first DAOs ever launched was called “The DAO”. Investors invested in it more than 14% of all circulating ETH at that time.The goal of the DAO was to create a community-driven venture capital fund that would invest in voting-based projects. We see that the foundations for managing DAOs by voting were laid at the very beginning of their formation. Joystream is no exception to the rule either. Members of the Joystream Council are elected by vote.

What are the achievements of the DAO?According to the latest report from Messari, one of the trends in the crypto industry in 2022 is DAOs. During the year, we may see the restructuring of such organizations, the emergence of child DAOs and a new distribution of roles between participants. Autonomous decentralized organizations will have better collaboration tools, which will allow the community to get rid of passivity and become more efficient. DAO tools will help them with this. This is a trend that we can see throughout the existence of Joystream.

DAOs are moving towards official recognition. In April 2021, Wyoming passed a law recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations as a new form of company. A few months later, the first DAO was approved. But in November 2021, the SEC suspended token registrations from the first legally recognized entity, saying it provided “misleading information” to potential investors.

In 2021, there was a wave of investment DAOs where token holders could invest their money in NFTs, Web3 projects, cryptocurrencies, or other DAOs. An example of such an organization is Joystream, which allows video creators to monetize their work through the Atlas platform, but this is not the main thing, the basis is correctness and accuracy in everything.

I would like to summarize briefly that DAOs have a pretty substantial backstory and development history. As platforms continue to evolve and improve, DAOs could usher in an era in which everyone becomes a consumer, employee, and manager of disparate decentralized firms and everyone else falls by the wayside. I am convinced that Joystream will play an important role in this direction. Therefore, my personal opinion is that this is the future of the cryptocurrency market!
