# **Difference between Joystream and other DAOs**

Nowadays, more and more new projects in different spheres of life appear every day, and more and more the world is moving from offline to online and organizing future metaclasses.

Before considering the differences between Joystream and other DAO systems, let’s examine what Joystream is.

[Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/ru/) is one of the leaders of our future web 3.0. First of all, it’s a DAO-driven video platform, which means there are all kinds of ways you can join the project and make money by contributing to it.In a way, Joystream is the cool new equivalent of Youtube, allowing content makers to create content and monetize it quickly.

**So what are the advantages of this video platform?**

We all know about the strict moderation of video content on YouTube, and how many videos are deleted there. Users can’t like that, so decentralizing Joystream will help us solve this problem.

In addition, a huge advantage of the Joystream video platform is that it strives to provide video creators with alternative ways to monetize their videos, which is just incredibly amazing!

Joystream’s main goal is to make media platforms accountable to the people they affect, which is primarily their users, whether they are consumers, creatives, third-party developers or employees.

The second significant benefit is that creators can create their own tokens and have their video mining in the form of non-functional tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain.

A key feature of digital currencies is that they are decentralized. This means that these are not controlled by a single institution, such as a government or central bank, but rather are distributed across multiple computers, networks and nodes. In many cases, virtual currencies take advantage of this decentralized status to achieve levels of privacy and security not normally available to standard currencies and their transactions.

DAOs represent a new way for people to collaborate in Web 3.0 era.

They remove the corporate ladder from organizations and allow any member to speak out regardless of their position, education, or personal identity.

There are various ways in which most DAOs are different from one another. Joystream DAO features a different organizational structure and a video-based project. Joystream DAO uses a platform known as Atlas to create video-based NFTs, which means these videos can also be mined as NFTs.

Another difference is that the Joystream DAO also has a structured composition of different working groups that have leaders and alternates, as well as recruiting members to those working groups.

Within the DAO, votes are submitted via blockchain and are available for public viewing. This requires users to act as they see fit, as their votes and decisions will be publicly posted. This encourages actions that will benefit the reputation of the voters and discourages actions against the community.

The Joystream platform offers 2 ways to monetize your videos:

**1. You can create your own token**In Atlas, video creators can issue their own tokens, allowing creators to unite the most engaged members of the community around the creator’s future creative work and community, pooling community resources and sharing profits. This is especially important for creators with ambitious plans to scale before they gather a large audience.

**2. You’ll be able to create your videos as NFTs**Video creators can bid any of their videos for sale as NFTs using 3 different types of auctions English (predetermined end date), Open (no predetermined end date) and Buy Now (auction ends as soon as the bid matches the predetermined price). NFTs are also available for sale on the secondary market, where the creator can also receive royalties on sales.

By sharing the benefits, community members become natural advocates and collaborators in maximizing the creator’s future success.
