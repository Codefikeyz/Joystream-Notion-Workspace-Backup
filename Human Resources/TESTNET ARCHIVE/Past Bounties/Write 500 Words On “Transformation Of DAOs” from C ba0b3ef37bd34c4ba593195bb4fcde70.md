# **Transformation of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pIienbz9Rt2jRqIOBFtIcA.jpeg)

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) started as a simple concept intended as organizations created by an idea and driven by developers to automate functions and business processes using smart contracts and all the fundamentals of the blockchain. The core idea of the DAO is to remove the complex business processes of different organizations and facilitate the movement of assets into a future-oriented digital interaction without intermediaries — promising faster, cheaper and more transparent transaction processing.

By replacing many intermediaries, DAOs themselves act as digital intermediaries, providing transparency and scalability, creating organizational scale without the need for entities, groups, management, rules, and other forms of collective action like traditional organizational structures. While the traditional centralized organizational system is struggling, important organizational factors are still driving a new economic revolution, birthing a new creative economy, and bringing artists to life. Lawyers, developers and creators from around the world come together to generate ideas and monetize them on a global scale in permissionless cryptoeconomic systems built on blockchain technology and Web 3.0 — fundamentally shaping the future of work. Joystream could be seen to be practising these features even before mainnet launch.

A broad definition of a DAO would be an organization that records its membership, rules, and responsibilities in an immutable ledger made possible by blockchain technology. Its charter and developments are public and cannot be changed. In general, participation requires resources and community membership, either in the form of tokens to participate or to vote as a participant. Tokens are valued in relation to financial assets (fungible or non-fungible tokens), whether they are cryptocurrency or fiat money. Typically, acquiring tokens requires both time and expertise, or buying with fiat or cryptocurrency.

The DAO offers a unique structure that naturally supports the creative economy, in which an economic model supports a structure through which you can hire your expertise and time, gain flexibility, activity and income, and use it to leverage piecemeal ownership into a Facilitate system that is supported and managed by the community. Linked via blockchain, DAOs provide a natural governance structure for limitless online collaboration on digitally native crypto projects, which can thus be leveraged by traditional organizations that follow the same principles as traditional businesses find their way to the digital equivalent the age of Web 2.0.

While issues remain around regulatory clarity and investor protection frameworks, these digital entities represent a nation-state of sorts, trying to attract talent, capital and innovation. While governance and participation rules are not perfect, they are a constant experiment in innovation aimed at transforming the way we live and empowering any community willing to participate.

Web 3.0 as a technology model aims to support the creation, encoding and movement of value and assets. The purpose of Web 3.0 is to regulate ownership of assets and provide portability of digital assets through coding, paving the way for the exchange of that digital value for exchangeable digital assets, thus allowing creators to monetize their labor efforts. These efforts may include mining (but often not limited to) and content creation such as art, music, and other forms of NFTs that represent a stake in an ecosystem, such as tokens.
