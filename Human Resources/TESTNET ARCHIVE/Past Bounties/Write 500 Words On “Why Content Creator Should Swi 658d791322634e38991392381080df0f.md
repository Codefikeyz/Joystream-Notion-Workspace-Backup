# **Why content creator should switch to Atlas?**

Nowadays, every video content creator faces big revenues, which are: high centralization, inflexible monetization, speech censorship, unfair profits between creators and auditors. Joystream DAO offers a solution to this problem.

Joystream DAO is a blockchain based video platform. Video platforms such as YouTube and RuTube are analogues of Joystream, but with one significant difference: in Joystream, the goal of developers is to build a management system in such a way that literally every user can influence the development of the platform. That is, the power will not be with the Joystream Corporation itself, but with the users. Thus, the Joystream team radically solves the problem of high centralization in the field of video content platforms.

# **Atlas**

Joystream has two main products. The first is Atlas, which is actually a platform for downloading and watching videos. That is, what the uninterested user sees first of all. To date, Atlas, in my opinion, is not yet a full-fledged analogue of YouTube due to the large number of bugs, the lack of video editing capabilities, the maximum upload size limit of 10 GB and the inability to leave likes and comments. You can go to [my channel](https://play.joystream.org/channel/2021?tab=Videos) and see for yourself.

However, it should be understood that Atlas is currently still at the testnet stage, so it would be fair to demand perfect work and rich functionality from it. The Atlas will be improved and changed, new functions will be added, possibilities will expand.

# **Pioneer**

The second and most significant product of Joystream is Pioneer, a project management platform. With it, you can become a Joystream member, create a wallet, transfer or stake tokens, check your balance. But the most important thing is that through Pioneer you can apply to the council and, becoming a consul, create a proposal to improve the project.

As mentioned above, the Joystream is run by the users themselves, or rather the Council, which consists of Consuls. Consul elections are held weekly, however, in order to become one of them, you must apply and get enough votes in tJOY test tokens. The candidates with the most tokens staked during the voting period become Consuls for a week.

Council is needed to make various decisions. The only duty of the Consul is to vote on various matters. Any member of the community can make this or that proposal, but only members of the Council, that is, Consuls, can approve or reject it.

For the fact that the Consuls vote they get paid. The award is calculated based on the number of votes. This should encourage the Council to vote faster and accept/reject more proposals.

Consuls also have access to KPIs. These are tasks that the project developers post every week. KPIs are paid in test tokens, which can then be withdrawn and exchanged for real money. When the project developers post new KPIs, one of the Consuls creates a thread on the forum corresponding to the number of new KPIs. There, Council members can choose which task they will perform and report it.

# **Conclusions**

Thus, for content creators Joystream, namely its Atlas product, is the very user-friendly platform that does not have the disadvantages of such giants as YouTube. The Atlas platform, in its final form after the completion of the testnet, will be accountable to the people it influences, whether they are their end users, content creators, third-party developers or staff members. Another argument for content creators to choose Atlas is that Joystream uses state-of-the-art distributed systems technology, including blockchain, as well as smart contracts and tokens.
