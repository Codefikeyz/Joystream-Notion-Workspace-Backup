**An article regarding the state of Joystream DAO at the moment**

**Meaning of Dao.**

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are a new type of governing body. Every member of a DAO often works toward a common objective and makes an effort to behave in the entity’s best interests in the absence of a central governing body. DAOs are used to make choices in a bottoms-up management style and have gained popularity among bitcoin enthusiasts and blockchain technology.

Joystream is a new type of legal structure known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Every member of a DAO often works toward a common objective and makes an effort to behave in the entity’s best interests in the absence of a central governing body. DAOs are used to make choices in a bottoms-up manner, and they have gained popularity thanks to bitcoin enthusiasts and blockchain technology.

The decentralized nature of digital currency is one of its key characteristics. This indicates that they are distributed among numerous computers, networks, and nodes rather than being under the jurisdiction of a single organization like a government or central bank. Virtual currencies sometimes take use of this decentralized nature to achieve levels of privacy and security that are normally not possible for transactions with traditional currency.

**Background of Daos**

The DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is one of the most amazing ideas to be effectively executed through blockchain technology. Smart contracts are the means of operation for decentralized autonomous groups. The term “decentralized” refers to the fact that its financial transactions and laws are recorded on a blockchain, essentially eliminating the need for a central governing body.

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (often referred to as The DAO) was created with the intention of functioning as a venture capital fund for the cryptocurrency and decentralized industries. In principle, the lack of a centralized authority should give investors more control and access while also lowering expenses.

The Genesis DAO, often known as The DAO, was first announced at the beginning of May 2016 by a small group of Ethereum community members. It was created on the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract. The Slock created the coding framework as an open source project. It was created by a team, but it was launched by Ethereum community members under the name “The DAO.” During the DAO’s founding period, anyone was permitted to deposit Ether to a specific wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens from 1 to 100. The creation phase was an unexpected success because it was able to collect 12.7 million Ether, which at the time was valued around $150 million and was the largest crowdfund ever. The total value of the Ether from The DAO at one point, when it was trading at $20, exceeded $250 million.

To put it simply, the platform would give anyone with a project the opportunity to present it to the community and maybe win money from The DAO. Anyone holding DAO tokens could vote on projects, and they would then be rewarded if they were profitable. Things were improving once the finance was in place. Several developers developed the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which was motivated by the decentralization of cryptocurrencies.

The goal of a DAO is to encourage management and monitoring of an entity that resembles a corporation. The lack of a centralized authority, however, is what makes a DAO unique; instead, the collective group of leaders and participants serves as the governing body.

**The Status of Joystream Currently**

The final testnet being launched by DAO Joystream will take a snapshot on October 21st. With the help of the majority of members, we will also launch our mainnet on December 1st. Instead of incentives, this new testnet’s members would greatly increase their contributions to the development of the DAO and the community as a whole. There could be another AMA session whereby you can ask any questions you have concerning the DAO. This is the current state of joystream DAO.
