As going through the current handbook, there seem to be a Flow and structure of content problem.

The content is apt and need only few additions but needs a lott of rearrangement.

### **Section 1:**

**Start Here**

- It directly starts with something labelled OPPORTUNITIES: which are not even opportunities, they are roles.
- It would be better to start with basic information about joystream.

Joystream:

- Information about joystream as a platform and Joy token. ( should include blockchain it is on )
- Mission, vision and Roadmap. (Roadmap: in form of graphic with highlighted region of current phase of testnet and DAO formation with respect to entire roadmap. )
- Explain what is a DAO and why Joystream chose to go with DAO: Its benefits, how exactly it empowers contributors and viewers.

**$JOY**

- needs revamping entirely.
- Explanation of Joy being native token of ecosystem.
- entire tokenomics in form of pie chart:
    - distribution that jsgenesis wants.
    - Its utility inside the joystream ecosystem for:
        - content creators
        - viewers
        - DAO members and Founding Members.
        - governance rights

**Jsgenesis:**

- This part is nicely portrayed though it would be better to add company’s infographics and visual here. This thing helps build TRUST.
- Founders' photos, twitter and linkedin links.
- Routine information like website links, social media links and blogs.

### **Section 2:**

**Testnet rewards:** ( suggestion: changing name to DAO rewards: We can always explain inside it, that right now it is in testnet. ).

- the content explained in video and the text content following, is not in sync.
- We need to curate the FLOW of the content of text in sync with video.
- 1ST: Start with explaining the structure. ( all of this is graphic form of network or DAO or grassroot form )
    - Participants
        - their description as initial new members.
        - CTA to join departments.
    - departments
        - various departments, their roles and responsibilities
        - what kind of person would be suitable for each department
        - department workers
        - department leads
    - then Founding member program.
        - What is founding member program.
        - How to reach there?
        - Rewards.
    - Then council.
        - Then in description of council, explain the cadence and council period parameters.
- Then Explain the dynamics and functioning of the DAO.
    - how are the rewards given.
    - tasks of various roles as described ( previously OPPORTUNITIES table in section 1 )
    - bounties
        - already existing
        - create your own
        - Explain the bounty process by taking snapshots of in process and on going bounties for better visualization.
        - referrals

Then the flow as shown in video.

TYPO error:

There is a typo error at section 2 >> Testnet rewards >> Funding request >> 1st paragraph >> last sentence. “…we will not able to the recipient”

**suggestion:** “Not be able to link the recipient”.
