# **What is DAO. Important Points**

**How DAO and Joystream works?**Within the DAO, all decisions are made collectively. That is, any member of the system can propose improvements for the decentralized protocol, and if the rest of the community votes for them, they will be accepted.

Developers can’t implement changes without community approval, but only add new code when members have accepted the improvements.

This principle is radically different from the election of members of the government: the electorate votes only for candidates, but does not decide on the adoption of new laws. Instead, the DAO proposes to vote on exactly the changes that need to be made to the protocol, without the need to delegate power to any person or group of people.

Thus, in a decentralized autonomous organization, the role of the manager is played by the program, but it does not make decisions on its own: the community does, and the program only executes instructions.

Answering the question what is DAO in cryptocurrency, it is worth noting that the meaning of the DAO economy is to involve users in the active management and development of the ecosystem of a particular platform. As a rule, users, participating in voting, can receive rewards.

**Main advantages**

Among the clear advantages of decentralized autonomous systems are parameters such as decentralization and transparency.DAO is decentralized and does not require trust in intermediaries or protocol due to open source.

As already mentioned, in an autonomous decentralized organization there is no hierarchical ladder, so a separate group or control center cannot make decisions, ignoring the interests of other participants.

The second plus is the same autonomy. Once launched, the protocol works without intervention from the governing bodies. Users perform transactions, and the smart contract monitors the fulfillment of the obligations of the parties. In the event that one party does not fulfill the terms of the transaction, it will not be completed.

An important aspect in the work of DAO is the speed of decision making. The user proposes changes and the community either approves or rejects them. The time allotted for making a decision is determined by the minutes, and it can also be changed by voting.

**Main Disadvantages of DAO**

One of the main disadvantages of decentralized autonomous organizations is the legal uncertainty that prevents their use. The problem is aggravated by the fact that once the system is implemented in a private or public organization, it will not be possible to establish control over it.

Another disadvantage is the controversial efficiency of the ecosystem. On the one hand, if we are talking about global changes, the DAO outright outplays the clumsy bureaucratic machine, which requires huge investments in both time and finances. But in the case of small changes, a decentralized approach can be not only useless, but also harm the system. According to experts, a hybrid approach to management will be the most effective. It is only important to correctly define the powers of the management members.
