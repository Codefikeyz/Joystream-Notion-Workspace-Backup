The logic is different in the working relationships between DAOs and their collaborators. There are different types of governance. but as a rule, employees have the role of defining what will be done and even what will be the financial remuneration for the activities, horizontalizing the working relationship, and creating fairer relationships.

Another essential role of DAOs is to dedicate themselves to causes and purposes ignored by large conventional organizations, sometimes out of ignorance and lack of commercial interest and infeasibility in their business model.

These incredible qualities make DAOs fundamental institutions, with the potential to contribute to people’s development and improve the quality of life for all of us, both for the causes in which they work and for what they offer to their employees.
