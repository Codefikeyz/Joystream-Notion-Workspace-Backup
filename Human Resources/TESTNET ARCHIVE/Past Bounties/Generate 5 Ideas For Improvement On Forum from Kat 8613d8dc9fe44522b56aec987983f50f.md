1. The completed work should have been open only to the owner of the work and the administrator.
2. Make the user account more convenient and understandable, so that all tasks are displayed there: new and completed. To receive notifications that the work has been checked and submitted not to Discord, but to the account on the site. In general, you need to improve the office as much as possible.
3. Make a single account with tJoy, it's not very convenient to create a separate account for each active bounty and transfer tJoy. It would be more convenient if it was a single account
4. Make additional awards for well-written work. To encourage everyone to write high-quality texts.
5. Come up with a new task: for example, invite 5 new users. This will help expand the community.
6. Add additional moderators so that there is a faster response to messages on the forum.
