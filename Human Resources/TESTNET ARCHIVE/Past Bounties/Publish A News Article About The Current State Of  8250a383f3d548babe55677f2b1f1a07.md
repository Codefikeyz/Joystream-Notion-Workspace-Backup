# **Joystream DAO**

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) — is a new form of legal structure. In the absence of a central governing body, each DAO member usually shares a common goal and tries to act in the best interests of the organization. Popularized by cryptocurrency and blockchain technology enthusiasts, DAOs are used for decision making in a bottom-up approach to governance.A decentralized autonomous organization — is a legal structure in which token holders participate in the management and decision making of a legal entity.The DAO has no central authority; instead, power is distributed among token holders who collectively vote.

## **All votes and actions through the DAO are published on the blockchain, making all user actions public.**

DAOs rely heavily on smart contracts. These logically coded conventions dictate decision making based on the underlying activity on the blockchain. For example, depending on the outcome of the decision, a specific code could be implemented to increase the circulating supply, burn a certain number of reserve tokens, or issue select rewards to existing token holders.

The current state of Joystream is quite intriguing, as the main net is due to go live in mid-October. The final testnet, called Carthage, launched in September and will run prior to the mainnet launch. After the launch of the main network, JOy tokens will be distributed among all participants who have reached FM status. A status that requires you to reach at least 10.000$JOYNew members are still accepted into the organization as they are still being pushed to join the community and complete rewards to ensure they qualify as FM before the mainnet launch.The HR WG ensures that members’ questions and requests are answered effectively and to the best of their ability to further the growth of the Joystream community.

Marketers are also involved in recruiting and help promote the name of the project on most social platforms. From writing articles and guides to recruiting and creating, all of the teams at the Joystream DAO work hand in hand to ensure the collective growth of the Joystream community.
