# **History and achievements of DAOs**

Let’s take a look at the details of DAO today. DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that is managed through smart contracts. DAOs don’t have a traditional hierarchy. They work transparently, according to the rules prescribed in the code. Joystream is a classic example of a decentralized autonomous organization.

DAOs bring people together around a common goal or interest. Taken a closer look, DAOs show how large groups of people can be organized as a decision-making body that will ultimately change the way businesses operate.

The DAO concept was born in 2013. Key principles :decentralization of companies,tokenization of their shares,openness of transactions with a publicly verified code, so there is no catch.Over the years, the community has refined this idea and adapted it to any organization of people for profit, but this was not the main thing for them. This is the concept of modern DAOs.

Blockchain can be seen as the basic infrastructure for building a DAO. In other words, a decentralized autonomous organization is an application deployed on top of an existing network. For example, Joystream is similarly deployed on the Polkadot network.

In 2016, one of the first DAOs ever launched was called “The DAO”. Investors invested in it more than 14% of all circulating ETH at that time.The goal of the DAO was to create a community-driven venture capital fund that would invest in voting-based projects. We see that the foundations for managing DAOs by voting were laid at the very beginning of their formation. Joystream is no exception to the rule either. Members of the Joystream Council are elected by vote.

The concept of DAO (the first name is decentralized autonomous corporations, DAC) was born in 2013. The key principles of the DAC were:

decentralization of companies,tokenization of their shares,openness of transactions with a publicly verifiable code.Over time, the community has refined this idea and adapted it to any organization of people with or without profit. This is the concept of modern DAOs.

The starting point for the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations can be considered the emergence of Ethereum, the first blockchain platform in which the logic of smart contracts was implemented. Smart contracts have made it possible to create autonomous systems controlled by a program, and not by a person, which eliminates the possibility of data manipulation, thus there is no dependence on the human factor.

Thanks to smart contracts, it has become possible to create various decentralized systems that allow users to make transactions without the participation of intermediaries. These include DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), applications (DApps), and autonomous organizations (DAOs).

DAOs are moving towards official recognition. In April 2021, Wyoming passed a law recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations as a new form of company. A few months later, the first DAO was approved. But in November 2021, the SEC suspended token registrations from the first legally recognized entity, saying it provided “misleading information” to potential investors.

In 2021, there was a wave of investment DAOs where token holders could invest their money in NFTs, Web3 projects, cryptocurrencies, or other DAOs. An example of such an organization is Joystream, which allows video creators to monetize their work through the Atlas platform, but this is not the main thing, the basis is correctness and accuracy in everything.
