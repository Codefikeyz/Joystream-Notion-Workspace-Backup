[Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/) is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. In comparison to known video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) operated and governed by its users.

Joystream is a decentralized platform for streaming and sharing video content governed by DAO. The main goal of Joystream is to focus more on content creators, creatives and also consumers. With fairer reward distribution, censorship resistance and immunity to interventions by global entities.

It’s part of a broader crypto movement that aims to empower individual creators over corporations. While content stalwarts such as YouTube tightly govern how their creators make money (and grant them limited say in how the platform evolves) Joystream’s planned decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) would hand over the keys.

“Giving the stakeholders the tools required to decide, fund and direct the operation and evolution of the system is a much more durable approach, and one which is going to make it much more attractive for developers to build applications on top of Joystream,” said Bedeho Mender, CEO of the primary company building Joystream, called [Jsgenesis](https://www.jsgenesis.com/).

According to Mender, the startup, which has been around since 2015, was originally building atop the BitTorrent protocol. It pivoted to creating a video platform in 2018 and has been preparing for mainnet launch ever since.

Right now it’s preparing to launch a mainnet in Q2 or Q3 of this year that will allow for a custom DAO, an NFT marketplace for creator’s videos and a platform for creator’s to monetize their videos with their own tokens.

Other decentralized video platforms such as LBRY and DTube are more limited in scope, hosting crypto tipping.

There are various different active roles in the Joystream. They are listed below:

# **Council Members**

Participants in the voting process — they vote for new proposals. Council Members are voted for a limited period.

# **Storage Providers**

Videos, images and other content media are not stored on the blockchain due to the amount of data. Storage and distribution nodes take care of those. The main role is here for Storage Lead, who is voted by Council and takes care of hiring, firing and management of Storage Providers.

# **Content Curators**

Monitoring newly published content, verification of data validity and ownership. In their heart could be elected Content Curator Lead, who then hire other Curators.

# **Content Creators**

Crucial position within the Joystream. Content Creators make and publish new content on the platform and monetize it.

# **The JOY token**

The native token of Joystream will be the JOY token.

The Joystream Network Token (JOY) is an oncoming fundamental component of the Joystream platform. Besides the payment function, it will have an important role in staking and governance as well.

# **Payment**

JOY tokens will be used for payment on the platform and beyond.

# **Staking**

For earning the rewards, users must stake some amount of JOY tokens to be able to participate on the platform. Those funds may be slashed if users misbehave.

# **Governance**

Voting in DAO is an important role of the token holders.

# **Conclusion**

Today’s web 2.0 is broken and corrupted. Content creating platforms serve their owners and not to its users. By creating Joystream, users will have a fair chance for the monetization of their video content and at the same time, they can use the advantage of staking JOY tokens. And the most important thing from the decentralized point of view is the governance management system of Joystream, which will be fully under the control of Joystream DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). And that is, what matters in Web 3.0. Joystream seeks to act as a decentralized YouTube, Creators can mint their videos as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain, and each channel has its own native token. Consumers can invest in their favorite creator’s success, as well as take profits from their NFT sales on the platform.
