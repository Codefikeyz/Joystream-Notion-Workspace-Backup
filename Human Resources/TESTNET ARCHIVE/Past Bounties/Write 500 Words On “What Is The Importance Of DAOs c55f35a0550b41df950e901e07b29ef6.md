Web3 autonomy and decentralization redefine community. It shows a system without a hierarchy or centralized government, only a group of people working together on a project out of common interest. Their main goal is typically to fund projects or create products while fostering an open community culture where people may collaborate and develop new skill sets by connecting with like-minded individuals.

## **Defining Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAO)**

Community-driven groups without a centralized authority or governing body are known as decentralized autonomous organizations. They are open-source entities powered by smart contracts.

DAOs use smart contracts, which are straightforward programs enabled by blockchain technology, to create rules, keep track of activity, and automate procedures. Since a DAO is not administered by a single entity, members of the community must make proposals to influence community procedures. Votes are then cast, and the protocol is then automated by a smart contract. It is important to remember that processes are always open to scrutiny and can be audited whenever necessary. Smart contracts can also be used in DAOs to create dApps, distribute tokens, and assign tasks and bounties.

## **Contributing to DAOs**

DAOs, like other communities, come with all the vigour, excitement, and mood. There is always a backlog of activities happening on discord channels. It is incredibly simple to get lost in a channel because of the expanding user base. Understanding the project’s goals and determining whether you are truly interested in them are two critical steps to making meaningful contributions to DAOs. It is important to remember that DAOs vary from one another, and as a result, so do their regulations and methods of contributing.

Using [Joystream DAO](https://www.joystream.org/get-started/) as an example, I would be explaining how DAOs work and how to contribute to one.

Read through the website, and understand what the DAO is about.

Joystream is a decentralized digital media platform that allows its users to stream video content that allows it.

You would need to also connect a [Polkadot wallet](http://polkadot.js.org/extension/) since Joystream DAO is built on the Polkadot network.

Here is a guide on how to create a Polkadot account and link it to your Joystream guide

After this point you are good to go, you can now go through the open [bounty](Bounty%20Suggestions%20(Testnet)%20511529f82e2342cf8157ff727827d65c.md) list and choose a bounty you would want to contribute to.

Remember to check in with HR on discord, to make sure you get the bounty assigned to you.

After making a contribution, you are rewarded with tJOY tokens which can be converted to BCH.

## **The Importance of DAOs**

DAOs come with a couple of advantages, over centralized communities.

Some of these advantages are:

**Transparency:**

Blockchain technology and smart contracts power decentralized autonomous communities. Everyone in the community can see how much money has been invested and how much has been raised for the project, and even contributors find it easier to keep track of their tokens in this transparent world.

**Decentralization:**

Decentralization in DAOs means that each participant has a role to play in the community. The founders, the developers, and the governing body are all members. The opinions of the members are taken into account when making decisions that have an impact on the community.

**Collaboration:**

DAOs give space for engaged collaboration. Members from different countries can cooperate and work on projects together. It’s a great way to earn money, get involved, learn things, and develop your abilities.

**Community engagement:**

DAOs redefine civic participation. With the help of tasks, tokens, and voting processes, it offers a pleasant approach to keep members interested. Members can advance through the DAO structure’s levels and become council members.

[Decentralized autonomous organisations](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/) have demonstrated a flexible approach to forming communities. DAOs have a number of restrictions, but their benefits outweigh them. Visit [https://app.daohaus.club/explore](https://app.daohaus.club/explore) to get a list of DAOs to start contributing to.
