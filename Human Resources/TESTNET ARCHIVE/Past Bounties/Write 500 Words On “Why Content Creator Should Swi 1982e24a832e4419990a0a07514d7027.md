# **Why Content Creator Should Switch To Atlas?**

**C**urrently, video content is the most popular among users. But have you ever wondered why? It’s because video offers a higher degree of entertainment and deeper interaction with the speaker by incorporating non-verbal communication. Another bonus is that video content appeals to both eyes and ears.

We are now living in a time when all online content is moving to a new model, web 3.0, where everything will be decentralized because it will use blockchain technology, where you will own the content that you post online. No one will be able to remove your information (posts, videos, content) from the sites, it will forever remain in the blockchain network.

At the moment, the main platform for watching videos is Youtube.But, unfortunately, it has many disadvantages.

**Disadvantages that will soon cause YouTube to be superseded**

— A lot of annoying ads, which the platform shows more and more often, make ordinary users visit this site less and less often.

— All of your work, videos, design, branding, subscribers, promotion, etc. can be blocked and deleted with a swipe of a moderator’s hand or the system itself automatically, often without the right to correct anything, and also often without announcing a clear reason.

— It is difficult to work with their internal video editing tools, you have to turn to third-party resources.

— The process of uploading videos to the site, as well as rendering videos for the author, sometimes takes dozens of hours.

— Tough content creation rules.

***Atlas: the video platform of the future***

[Joystream](https://www.joystream.org/ru/) is one of the leaders of our future web 3.0. First of all, it’s a DAO-driven video platform, which means there are all kinds of ways you can join the project and make money by contributing to it.In a way, Joystream is the cool new equivalent of Youtube, allowing content makers to create content and monetize it quickly.

We all know about the strict moderation of video content on YouTube, and how many videos are deleted there. Users can’t like that, so decentralizing Joystream will help us solve this problem.

In addition, a huge advantage of the Joystream video platform is that it strives to provide video creators with alternative ways to monetize their videos, which is just incredibly amazing!

Joystream’s main goal is to make media platforms accountable to the people they affect, which is primarily their users, whether they are consumers, creatives, third-party developers or employees.

The second significant benefit is that creators can create their own tokens and have their video mining in the form of non-functional tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain.
