Short poem about Joystream

We were taken from the ore-bed and the mine,
We were melted in the furnace and the pit—
To make us soft
We were cast and wrought and hammered to design,
We were cut and filed and tooled and gauged to fit.
Some water, coal, and oil is all we ask,
And a thousandth of an inch to give us play:
And now, if you will set us to our task,
We will serve you four and twenty hours a day,
We will be more closer to our keyboard than ever,
To work for technology,
To work for Joystream.
