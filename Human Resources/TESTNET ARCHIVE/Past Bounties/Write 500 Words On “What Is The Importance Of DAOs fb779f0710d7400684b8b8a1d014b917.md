# **What is the importance of DAOs?**

That said, decision-making through DAO is faster and more convenient. With DAO, you don’t need the physical presence of individuals to vote over an issue. A blockchain developer who is good at #ethereum contract development can help you create smart contracts for DAO.

A DAO is run by its own members through the crypto tokens it issues. For example, Decentraland uses Decentraland DAO where they hold their very own MANA tokens to govern all the transactions, land, assets and many others within the virtual world. Rules governing a DAO are coded in the blockchain in the form of a smart contract. The smart contract automates processes, transactions, data storage and other changes and functions.Currently, there are over a thousand DAOs being used for many purposes like investing, charity, fundraising, managing stablecoins, and borrowing or buying NFTs.

# **Benefits of a DAO**

With opportunities and growth in DAO ever expanding, it is important to note the advantages and disadvantages that come with it.

The best DAOs share capital with their participants through a native token. You can also just simply buy it. **If DAO succeeds, every token owner can sell it with a profit**. Thus, the potential gains along with voting rights make possession of a DAO token much more valuable than having any other token.

# **Transparency**

Traditional organizations keep much of their operations internal, but DAOs are operated on a decentralized blockchain network where processes and transactions are transparent, stored permanently, and are viewable by the public.

# **Democratization**

All members of a DAO can vote on moves and changes, which encourages accountability and careful thinking among members. This creates a flat, fair and equal organization without the hierarchy hurdles. DAO members vote directly to make moves, changes and developments within the organization rather than electing members to make decisions on their behalf.

# **Automation**

DAO rules are embedded codes in the blockchain. As the program runs, the rules are enforced without the labor, manipulation, discrimation, or errors associated with human intervention.

# **Removal of Third party institutions**

Members can carry out transactions without the help and cost of outside institutions such as regulatory bodies, law practitioners, and other middlemen.

If for example members want to invest in a start-up or change the code of the program they run, DAOs can directly execute these plans via voting and subvert the need for banks, legal counsels and other mediators.

# **Meritocracy**

Members can work anywhere and be evaluated solely on their work. DAO operates virtually so members can work anytime at any place, even by the beach. Anyone can hold a DAO’s crypto token and have voting rights. Members are valued by their work output, not by how they look or how their credentials stand out. This prevents discrimination and fosters freedom to choose for every member of the DAO.

The term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clearly evident answers for your doubts. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-government/). Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs leverage [blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/) for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

# **Joystream DAO**

Joystream is a decentralized video platform running on its own blockchain (using the Substrate framework) and the project can be called the polkadot parachain. The development team aims to create an ecosystem in which each participant will be able to manage the system and receive certain rewards for this

This startup is open source and supported by [BITMAIN](https://www.bitmain.com/), [DC group](https://dcg.co/), [BoostVC](https://www.boost.vc/) and [StartupLab](https://startuplab.no/)

The core team includes Bedeho Mender (Founder / CEO), Mokhtar Naamani (Co-Founder / CTO) and Martin Wessel-Berg (COO)

Currently, there is no full launch of the platform, but several stages of test networks have already been passed, [play video](https://play.joystream.org/) and a [network portal](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/media) are working.
