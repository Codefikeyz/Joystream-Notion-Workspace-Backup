.Advocates and enthusiasts see DAOs as a revolutionary model for organising people, assets and activities, and believe that what the internet did for communication, DAOs can do for capital. Despite their heady potential, some see DAOs with a healthy dose of scepticism, declaring this revolutionary model to be fraught with risks, challenges, and hazards.

DAOs are based on blockchain technology principles; hence, they tend to favour a governance model rooted in those principles. This model involves multiple actors interacting as a community in a fully transparent way, with a democratic voting structure at its core, such as “one man, one token, one vote.”DAOs are not yet fully recognized in a legal sense. In fact, currently there are only two states in the United States that do formally recognize a DAO as a legal entity with limited liability: Wyoming and Vermont. For the rest of the states, as well as most legal jurisdictions outside the USA, there are legal questions around DAO ownership and liability. Such as: to whom are the actions of a DAO attributed to? Should a DAO file and pay taxes or be compelled to sign legally binding contracts? Are smart contracts an adequate substitute for legally binding contracts? These are just some of the questions in the legal realm that need to be addressed.”what the internet did for communication, DAOs can do for capital.” DAOs also face practical impediments in how they interact with the world. As crypto-native entities, they are hampered by the disconnect between the crypto world and the physical world. Exactly how to bridge this disconnect is very much still an open question.

For example: how do you ensure a physical artifact like the U.S. Constitution, a painting or a rare book is in fact governed according to the will of the token holders? In grappling with this question, ConstitutionDAO had the idea to move the DAO into a 501c3 legal structure so that the by-laws would require the directors to act in accordance with the will of the DAO token holders. To take another related example: if your legal status is not clearly defined under the law, how do you bid at a public auction? ConstitutionDAO circumvented this issue be relying on an intermediary — Endowment — to represent them and bid on their behalf at a Sotheby’s auction. These are just a couple of examples of the myriad ways in which DAOs are ill-equipped to deal with real world encounters and interactions. Not all DAOs are created equally. In fact, aside from the general corporate governance issues described here, DAOs may also face regulatory scrutiny depending on its structure and representations made by such DAOs. How each DAO approaches these issues will be different and will reflect the interests and values of its members. As our world becomes smaller and we are able to connect with people across the world faster and more deeply, DAOs will represent a paradigm shift in how individuals organize themselves.

Ultimately, though, how these groups govern themselves and their intended activities and navigate a very centralized world will determine their success and likely give us a glimpse on the decentralized future of society.
