# **What Are The Issues Of DAOs?**

When we refer to a DAO, we are referring to a community-controlled, decentralized autonomous organization. Additionally, blockchain and the financial incentives present in web3 enable them. A DAO’s future should be decided democratically by the community as a whole, not by any central authorities.

There is no CEO there to approve spending based on a whim, and there is no possibility of a CFO falsifying the records. Everything is open, and the rules for spending are spelled out in the DAO through its code.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are progressively becoming more and more popular in the Web 3.0 era and even beyond as more people look at potential investment opportunities.

Although in my opinion DAOs seem promise, they are still a relatively new creation with significant issues and difficulties that need to be resolved.

Poor infrastructure and legal difficulties are the first causes.

Due to their great digitality and decentralization, DAOs frequently lack the sophisticated and effective infrastructure that their conventional analogs employ. Before launching, many DAOs must create the necessary infrastructures and tools on their own, and the majority of these tools are pretty strange.

DAOs also lack the infrastructure required for managing reporting, cashiering, governance, payroll, communications, identity management, etc. Many DAOs risk losing their members and ultimately failing to acquire traction if they lack the infrastructure required to carry out these tasks.

But the Web3 industry’s accelerating innovation and collaboration are gradually assisting in the resolution of some of these issues.

DAOs are also comparable to many contemporary businesses, including corporations, non-profits, partnerships (both full and limited liability), and cooperatives. But the laws of the many nations in which these organizations are present govern and regulate them all.

Effective coordination or total decentralization are additional issues.

The majority of DAOs have a one-man-one-vote democratic governance structure. Despite the fact that this structure has numerous benefits, actively managing organizations should not be done in this fashion, especially when choices call for specialist knowledge.

The lack of token holders who may cast votes on proposals is another significant issue the DAO must deal with. Functioning of the DAO may be hampered by inactive token holders. And although while a lot of them can easily decide to assign votes, this also contributes to the centralization issue mentioned above. By rewarding active token holders and punishing idle ones, some DAOs are investigating the use of incentives to address this issue.

For DAOs looking for the correct governance, this is going to be a very complicated problem. The strategy used by various businesses will be crucial in determining the direction DAOs will follow.
