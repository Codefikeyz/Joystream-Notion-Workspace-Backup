# **Transformation of DAOs**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1374/0*IDzWhj9gL0VilJ9f.png)

Each company or organization has its own life cycle. It goes through a certain path of development and transformation. Joystream is not an exception. It is important to know the history well in order to avoid mistakes in the future. The question of transformation of decentralized autonomous organizations is very important for us. Because we try to contribute to the development of Joystream every day. If we understand the pitfalls of transformation of other DAOs well, we can improve the structure and the interaction of Joystream.

**Comparison of DAOs and other collective management forms**

As a form of collective management, the idea of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) is not new and largely reminds us of such well-known formats of common farming as Soviet collective farms, Israeli kibbutzim or Chinese people’s communes. The main feature of DAO is the presence of an internal service token — so each member of the organization has an “option for the employee”, and therefore they are interested not only in maximizing the efficiency of his work, but also in making the right managerial decisions, because their “bonus” in the future will directly depend on it.

**Rules**

Organization needs rules. A set of DAO rules is encoded as an immutable piece of software called a smart contract. The smart contract is the core of the DAO. To ensure immutability and autonomy, this smart contract functions on a blockchain infrastructure. This transparent and non-manipulable decision-making approach ensures the basic principle of autonomous DAO operation. It will always lead to the same result according to the encoded rules, no matter which member triggers an action in the DAO. This is best compared to the procedure rules of an organization written in software and recorded in a blockchain. The DAO smart contract also leaves no room for interpretation, unlike the rules of procedure written on paper, which should make conflicts lower between members. As the DAO evolves, the basic rules can be modified and supplemented according to the needs of the organization. For example, Joystream implements this mechanism through forum suggestions.

**Members**

Every organization needs members. The goal of the DAO is to create the equality of opportunity among members. Once the initial DAO rules are defined, the process of recruiting members must begin. This is usually done by issuing tokens in the blockchain world. Thus, token holders are members of the DAO and, according to the codified rules of procedure, they can make suggestions, participate in votes and share in the objectives and success of the DAO. Then voting is done using clear procedures embedded in the software. For example, Joystream had a small number of council members at the initial stage of development. Over time, the number of members increased. The council expanded in proportion to the growth of the number of community members.

**Tokens**

Most DAOs use tokens as a payment for community members. In the process of development, Joystream separates two tokens: tJoy for the test network and Joy for the mainnet.

As a **conclusion** I would like to say that there are different approaches for analizing the DAO transformation. But its vital for us is to analize the basic DAO aspects like tokens, members and rules. Because we interact with them every day. That’s why whe should know the life cycle of each parameter and use this knowledge to contribute to the Joystream project.
