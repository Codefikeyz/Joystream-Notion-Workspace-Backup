# **What are the issues of DAOs?**

**There are two problems with modern DAOs:**

Limited powers and the fact that control over them is very easy to intercept.

**The first problem is the most difficult.**Many projects actually manually regulate the **“agenda”** of the DAO. That is, often the control over the critical issues of project development remains with the team, despite the “cloak” of the DAO.

Since Joystream is a DAO, it seems that it will be controlled by ordinary people. Genesis wants the Founding Members to be several times. That is, on acceptance, students are currently being tested on our system and taught us to make decisions, accept, negotiate and get along together. And they expect that in the main network we (FM) occupy all the main positions in the project, and these are: a council member, a working group (there are three of them now), leaders of the working group.

Joystream is different from other projects. Everyone is used to seeing a list of specific tasks that can be done to get a certain number of points. There is no such list here. Each FM received its status due to the fact that it made a great contribution to the project, solved some problem.

**The second problem** is not only related to the proportional voting mechanism (the more coins you have, the more your vote weighs). Even in a situation where each user has only one vote, the DAO can be controlled by a very small number of people.

These problems can be solved only by strengthening the autonomy of the DAO. The more power the community gets and the less the team has control over the organization, the closer the decentralized dream will be.

We believe that creativity, whether it be literature, music, films, games or performance, is an essential tool for spreading collective knowledge among community members. These means of self-expression determine common values and, ultimately, participate in the formation of a common culture, value system, and even a political vector. Therefore, the sources and methods of their financing, as well as the ways of dissemination, play an extremely important role.

Today, digital media have become the main means of disseminating self-expression, and media platforms have begun to play the role of key organizers of this activity.

> Unfortunately, today, due to the effects of networks, economies of scale, regulations and political interests, only a handful of big players remain to dictate their own rules. These players practically do not obey the laws of the market and political mechanisms.
> 

As a result, our stories, self-expression and interaction are all controlled by them and filtered by their rules. This gives rise to a whole kaleidoscope of problems, such as

inflexible monetization, censorship of speech, unfair distribution of profits between content creators and audience, low level of innovation or lack of trust in third-party developers.

# **The main goals of preventing problems**

We believe that media platforms must be accountable to the people they influence, whether they be their end users, content creators, third party developers, or staff members.

The absence of such a form of reporting is the root of the problem.

# **Obstacles**

First of all, the issue of creating an alternative platform from scratch, given the strength of external factors that reduce the effectiveness of any new platform to zero, regardless of the potential capabilities of this platform. As history shows, the creation process is almost an art, and success can rarely be repeated.

We believe that tokens earned by participants in the early stages of the platform’s operation are an extremely effective means of mobilizing, integrating and motivating a dynamic community of participants from different countries.In the past, this has helped nascent communities like Bitcoin overcome the initial network effect hurdle [1, 2, 3]. While there is no guarantee that this will be enough, we see our strategy as promising in the long term.

# **Exit**

The way out is a complete cessation of interaction with the organizational structure in favor of joining an alternative one or creating one’s own alternative. The effectiveness of this approach depends on comparing the costs of leaving the relationship and joining the alternative, or creating one’s own alternative. To date, the cost of leaving the platforms is very high. Creating platforms based on open source code, protocols and public data, as in the case of systems based on blockchain technology, can drastically reduce this cost. Since users are in control of their own information, account, and assets, they can easily join the new platform, even taking all their friends with them.

My advice — if possible, give yourself to the project. Try to get into the idea of DAO. Go to the council, this will help you see problems from the inside that are not visible if you are overboard. You may end up with nothing, and that’s okay. And a great love can happen, as happened with me. And I will continue to acquaint you with **Joystream.** I hope this acquaintance will be pleasant.
