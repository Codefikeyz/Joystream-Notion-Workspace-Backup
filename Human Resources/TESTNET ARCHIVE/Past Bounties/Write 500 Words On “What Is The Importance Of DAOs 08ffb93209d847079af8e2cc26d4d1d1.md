Recently, more and more often you can come across such a concept as DAO. What does this mean? A **Decentralized Autonomous Organization** is an organization (group) of people that does not have a central leader and makes key decisions on the development of projects. DAOs are built on blockchain using smart contracts. To get into the DAO, you must have governance tokens. They can be obtained either by buying or by being active in the life of the project and receiving a delegation from the team. DAO members buy governance tokens specifically for the DAO, which give them the ability to vote on decisions for example about how a spent cash pool.

**What is special about DAO?**

*Anonymity*. As the term implies, this form of organization is anonymous. It does not matter the identity of the DAO member, but it does matter that he has a governance token and actively votes on the most important issues of projects.

There are no territorial boundaries. DAO members are not bound by any location and live in different cities, countries around the world. The main thing is that they have access to the Internet.

*Decentralization*. There is no pressure on the DAO from any centralized body, all members have the right to vote and are free to choose.

*The ability to influence the development of the project*. Members of the Decentralized anonymous organization vote on the most important issues of projects, thereby determining its further development.

*Openness*. The voting procedure is open and anyone can follow it.

*Availability*. Any member of the community who has at least one governance token on their balance sheet has the right to vote.

After we have understood the key features of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization system, let’s see why its development is important. It is well known that the main idea of the cryptosphere is decentralization. The usual centralized controls are closed to the majority and ineffective. It is this problem that DAO corrected by enabling all active members of the community to make key decisions and manage project funds. Also, centralized bodies have a clear hierarchy, and DAOs are absolutely democratic.

**How are DAOs organized?**

The rules for the operation of each DAO are embedded in smart contracts. The key feature is that these rules cannot be changed until these changes are voted by members of the community. Since decisions regarding the workflows, governance system, and incentive structure of a DAO must be voted on in order to take effect, smart contracts are required to make the DAO sustainable and autonomous.

**How are decisions made in the DAO?**

The user proposed changes and the community father approves or rejects them. The time allotted for making a decision is determined by the minutes, and it can also be changed by voting.

**What is the governance token for?**

As mentioned above, to participate in the DAO, you must own a governance token. Individual or legal entities interested in participating in DAO can purchase tokens, which are cryptocurrencies tied to specific projects. Token holders receive voting rights proportional to their share of ownership.

Let’s look at the work of DAO on a specific example, namely the DAO of the [**Joystream project](https://www.joystream.org/ru/).** It is a streaming platform managed by a DAO. The most active members of the community are selected as founding members and receive governance tokens. With their help, they vote on all important issues of the project. **Joystream has a classic DAO scheme that provides decentralized project management.**

**Conclusion**

Summing up the above, we can conclude that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a fairly new phenomenon that has such advantages as: decentralization, openness, anonymity, lack of territorial boundaries, the ability to influence the development of the project, accessibility. All these features provide decentralized control. This allows traditional organizations to move away from a hierarchical structure in favor of decentralized protocols, which can help reduce costs, simplify many processes, and eliminate problems associated with trust in a centralized approach. **I believe that DAO is the future.**
