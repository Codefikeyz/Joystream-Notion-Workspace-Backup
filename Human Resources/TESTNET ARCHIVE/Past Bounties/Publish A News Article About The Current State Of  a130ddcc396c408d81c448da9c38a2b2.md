# **The Current State Of Joystream DAO**

Today we will talk about the sensational DAO, which has already been called the killer of YouTube due to the large number of positive innovations for both content authors and ordinary users of the platform, and as you might have guessed, we are talking about Joystream, or rather about its current state, since the platform is in preparation for the mainnet.

Now the preparations for the mainnet stage are in full swing, which, by the way, is scheduled for the 4th part of 2022. The development team does a great job to prepare the product and make it of high quality for the user.

# **What is ready at the moment?**

Now social networks, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, GirHub and others are fully functioning in Joystream DAO, where users and developers share innovations and bug fixes, as well as communicate with each other for the benefit of the community.

Streaming service Atlas is functioning — it’s a video platform where community members publish videos, monetize them, connect with the audience, engage the audience in small communities around the author, and even sell the video as art

The Pioneer platform works —DAO management application with its own online forum and features that are not available in other services.

A lot of attention before the mainnet stage is given to bugs. What does it have to do with both ui /ux-related bugs and internal ones related to creator tokens, NFT, system operation, forum operation and user interaction with each other.

Joystream constantly holds AMA sessions, where it analyzes current problems, conducts voting and determines the pool of the nearest works necessary for the functioning of the entire system.

Now the project looks great, even being at the testnet stage, a large and professional team is working on it, as well as ordinary users who create content with their hands and receive local currency — tJoy tokens.
