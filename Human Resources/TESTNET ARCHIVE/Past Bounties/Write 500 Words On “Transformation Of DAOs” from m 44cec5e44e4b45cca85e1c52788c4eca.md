# **Transformation Of DAOs**

In this article, we will look at how the DAO developed.

As a form of collective management, the idea of DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations) is not new and in many ways reminds us of such well-known formats of a common economy as Soviet collective farms, Israeli kibbutzim or Chinese people’s communes. The main feature of the DAO is the presence of an internal service token — so each member of the organization has an “option for an employee”, and therefore they are interested not only in maximizing the efficiency of his work, but also in making the right management decisions, because this will directly depend their “bonus” in the future.

DeFi originated from the desire of the blockchain community to create an open, permissionless, decentralized financial system. Thus, DAOs offered an attractive way for projects to demonstrate their commitment to decentralization through community governance.

As a result, in 2020, when DeFi began to gain momentum rapidly, governance tokens have become very popular. Flagship DeFi applications including Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) have launched tokens that allow users to participate in decentralized governance, while new DeFi projects have started launching their governance tokens from the get-go.

Joystream, which is an example of Dao with a transparent treasury and direct democracy of all participants, is a sovereign digital jurisdiction that can fund projects within 5 minutes. DAOs are not government subsidized like charities, but what can be added through subsidies can be deducted many times over in time and administrative costs. When society realizes how easy it is to self-organize in this way, we will see a Cambrian explosion of activity that will do for organizations what the Internet has done for communication.

I think that today’s DAOs are still at an early stage, we are waiting for a long way of their evolution, after which DAOs will become truly DAOs in the broadest sense of the word.

“It is likely that in the future the average person will not work for the company,” Ben Schecter, who works on the RabbitHole crypto platform, writes in Future a16z. “Instead, people will generate income in non-traditional ways by doing activities such as playing games, learning new skills, creating art, or creating content.”

DAOs are still at a very early stage of implementation — the equivalent of 56k dial-up modems in the Internet timeline. This is not only because of how alien crypto can be, and not because of the difficulty of choosing a DAO platform, which can be significant, but in large part because of how legally vague the space is. Jurisdictions like Wyoming currently allow DAOs to register as LLCs, but founders still risk the wrath of securities laws if they promote the token to non-accredited investors.

Despite these uncertainties, the DAO space is evolving at an incredible pace. This article can only cover a subset of existing projects and even fewer new use cases that are being developed every day. Aragon started out as a dream to increase the speed of control iteration, and we can clearly see this happening today.
