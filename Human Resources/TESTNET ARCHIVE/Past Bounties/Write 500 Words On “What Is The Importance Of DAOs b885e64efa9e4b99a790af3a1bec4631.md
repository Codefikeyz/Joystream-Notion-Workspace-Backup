# **What is DAO?**

A DAO is simply a decentralized autonomous organization similar to any traditional organization like JoystreamDAO, Google, uber, etc. but the big difference is that it is autonomous, which means that activities and decision-making powers transferred to members of the organization from a crowdsourced pool of funds. It is completely transparent, autonomous and works without human intervention, including its original creators.

# **How DAO works**

DAOs work using smart contracts, which are essentially pieces of code that are automatically executed when a set of criteria is met. Currently, smart contracts are deployed on many blockchains, although Ethereum was the first to use them. These smart contracts set the rules of the DAO.

# **What is the importance of DAO?**

The term DAO says a lot about the reasons it came into existence. Firstly, we have it “decentralized” and “autonomous”. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete decentralization. In essence, the developers of the first DAO sought to transfer decision-making power to members of an organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs use blockchain to determine members’ voting rights in proposals to shape the future of an organization or project. At the same time, the benefits of decentralized autonomous organization are also important components of the web3 landscape. As such, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in today’s consumer-facing environments.

DAOs do not transfer control of a business or organization to one person or group. On the contrary, control over the business and the enterprise rests with a group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the benefits of DAO are also marked by the introduction of tokens (for example, the token name for Joystream is known as tJOY), which serve as vital tools for voting on various improvement proposals and protocol. Several DAOs with popular examples such as JoystreamDAO, Curve DAO, MakerDAO and others have encouraged many developers and business owners to opt for DAOs.

So DAO is a modern and streamlined approach to doing business because the problem that those who use watch faces are at risk of getting into legal trouble and all the laws regarding businesses and their corporate structures have not really been adjusted. for decentralized organizations until recently. DAOs exist to provide accountability and structure for the business.

# **DAO Examples**

There are various groups in the business that act like DAOs. Each group has a unique mission, rules and guidelines. Here are examples of famous DAOs:

- **PlearsDAO:** digital art collection platform.
- **HerStory DAO:** Provides funds to fund various black women’s programs.
- **Komorebi Collective DAO:** Funds the women and founders of a big-gender cryptocurrency.
- **Friends with Benefits DAO:** This is a unique community that requires you to pay to join.
- **MetaCartel Venture DAO:** An organization dedicated to investing in early-stage cryptocurrency decentralized applications.
- **Joystream DAO:** An open source blockchain video platform.
- **DAO Maker:** invests in early-stage crypto projects.

# **Conclusion**

While DAOs may not be suitable for every business, they have many features that can make a company’s processes more efficient. Transparent, immutable and trustless smart contracts make the DAO model the best for many organizations. Every day this Ethereum development project continues to improve and its future looks bright.
