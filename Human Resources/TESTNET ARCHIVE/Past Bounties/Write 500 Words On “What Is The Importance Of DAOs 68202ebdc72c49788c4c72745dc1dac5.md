# **WHAT IS DAO AND HOW DOES JOYSTREAM DAO WORK?**

As Web3 and blockchain become mainstream, new acronyms and terms are starting to come into our lives. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) is one of these cryptocurrency terms.

*Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)* can be likened to a club for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. DAOs only work for a common purpose, giving each member an right of audience in decision-making.

Still, they can appear in all areas of the decentralized internet world for activities such as funding big companies and raising money for blockchain-based projects. In addition, it is possible to say that the term DAO is not often encountered for those who simply buy and sell tokens. We need to remind you that these organizations hold a lot of resources. Here’s what the DAO is and what you need to know about the DAO.

**What is DAO?**

We can define DAOs as entities that are managed by the community and do not have a central authority.

These decentralized organizations; The basic rules of the group are written into the code, and the whole group makes the control of these rules. In addition, it aims to eliminate the extra cost and manpower created by process control.

**How do DAOs work?**

To explain a little more, the rules and laws of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are written into the source code of DAOs. Here, we can think that we have moved to a stage where the rules written on paper are now written into code. This set of rules and laws in the source code is processed through a consensus-based algorithm and by thousands of “nodes”. In a sense, it is possible to talk about a self-managing system. However, this system is open to change. In order for a change to be made in the DAO, the community must vote on the change to be made.

It is not much different from the operation of a company under normal conditions. But in DAO, the rules cannot be easily changed by a person because they are encoded in the code.

Moreover, they can be used not only in financial transactions within or outside the group, but also at any stage where decision-making in the group is required. Members can vote on many issues such as rule changes, adding or removing new rules. In short, we can call it a cryptographically guaranteed democracy.

**Function of crypto wallets and tokens in DAO**

To become a member of a DAO, you need to own a certain number of project tokens. These tokens are called government tokens. You can buy or gift them. Likewise, you can earn from governance tokens when you perform various tasks, as in the “win as you play” model that we come across in games.

Just as we’ve seen with NFTs, social networks, and apps, the token’s value increases as demand grows. In this context, as the number of people who own the governance token of the DAO increases, the market value of the tokens also increases.

The vast majority of DAOs today prefer to communicate via Discord. Therefore, a person with a governance token can become a member of Discord channels. Thus, it can take its place in both communication and decision-making processes.

**Can democracy turn into tyranny?**

DAOs, which draw attention with their democratic structure, can also bring examples of abuse of representative democracy. The more governance tokens a person owns, the more voting rights they can have. In this context, a single person can direct the fate of the entire organization.

On the other hand, DAO members can hold votes to overthrow an administration they do not like. However, let us remind you that voting results may change with those holding the right to vote. For now, we can talk about a similar management system that exists physically in companies and countries.

In addition, the operating principle of DAOs is determined depending on the contract. If the contract includes rules that will protect the democratic structure, the DAO will also be governed by a fair democracy. For example, the contract may state that a wallet cannot hold more than a certain number of tokens. However, a person can have a say in the management by acting with more than one wallet.

**How Does Joystream DAO Work ?**

You can apply to becoming a council member, or vote in the council member election. You can upload a proposal to suggest a new idea, and it will be voted on by the council. You can use your ownership to get your say in the direction of the organization, and not in a theoretical way, but in actual on-chain voting that cannot be defrauded. Also, everything is transparent, and out in the open for anyone to see, including budget & salaries.
