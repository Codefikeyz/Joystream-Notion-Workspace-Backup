**About the Importance of DAOs**

Many novel use cases have been inspired by the various stages of progress in the blockchain and crypto industry. When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, decentralized banking services, non-fungible tokens, and the metaverse are just the tip of the iceberg. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are one of the many opportunities that are emerging in this field.

DAOs offer promising opportunities for leveraging the advantages of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology because they were developed with the idea of building internet-native organizations under the ownership and control of the members. The benefits of DAO speak volumes about the value they offer.

The definition of DAO reveals a lot about the causes of its creation. Decentralization and autonomy are the glaringly obvious responses to your skepticism. To guarantee complete decentralization, DAOs have no ties to any nation. In essence, the creators of the first DAO wanted to use a crowdsourced fund pool to give the organization’s members more decision-making authority.

The voting rights for members in proposals to shape the future of the organization or project are defined by DAOs using blockchain technology. Decentralized autonomous organization benefits are also essential elements for the web3 landscape at the same time. For anyone interested in creating solutions for the current consumer-centric surroundings, DAO is an appealing option.

DAOs don’t give a single person or group of people authority over a company or other entity. On the other hand, the organization’s supporters or members are in charge of the company and its entity. The DAO advantages have also earned a name for themselves by offering tokens, which are essential instruments for voting on various protocol and improvement ideas. Many developers and business owners have chosen DAOs as a result of the availability of numerous DAOs with well-known examples as Curve DAO, MakerDAO, and others.

**DAO in Joystream**

A shared content platform called Joystream, a substrate-based video blockchain, aspires to become formally established. Unlike the current generation of video networks, Joystream is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is run and regulated by its users.

A hierarchy of individuals working together to create the future of this decentralized video network is the Joystream DAO. Everyone who works for the Joystream DAO receives $JOY tokens in proportion to their participation. The Joystream DAO has several distinct active responsibilities.

1. Council — participants in the voting procedure on the Council who cast ballots for presented ideas. Through the electoral process, council members are elected for a certain period of time.

2. Working teams — the Joystream platform divides non-validator service-provider roles into domain-specific groups with two different sorts of roles: leads and employees.

3. Bounties — smaller-scale, individualized tasks like translating the Joystream online or providing further marketing assistance. Bounties are a fantastic method to support the DAO and receive a bonus incentive in return.

The Joystream DAO’s upcoming responsibilities as well as some more positions:

- Content producers should produce, publish, and monetize new content on the Joystream platform.
- Curators of content keep an eye on freshly published material and confirm ownership and veracity of information. They are overseen by the lead content curator, who also appoints additional curators.
- Validators: in the PoS, these individuals verify that blocks are valid, suggest new ones, and take part in the consensus procedure for adding new blocks to the chain.
- Storage companies — due to the volume of data, films, photos, and other content media are not kept on the blockchain. Nodes for storage and dissemination handle those. The storage lead, a position that is chosen by the who manages the recruiting, firing, and other management of storage providers.
- future positions include membership curator, bandwidth provider, discovery provider, builder, and communication moderator.
