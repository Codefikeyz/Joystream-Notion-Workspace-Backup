# **A News article about the current state of Joystream DAO**

Joystream is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

- A decentralized autonomous organization is an entity structure in which tokenholders participate in the management and decision-making of an entity.
- There is no central authority of a DAO; instead, power is distributed across tokenholders who collectively cast votes.
- All votes and activity through the DAO are posted on a blockchain, making all actions of users publicly viewable.
- One of the first DAOs named The DAO was an organization created by developers to automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.
- A DAO must ensure security is prioritized, as exploits can leave a DAO drained of millions of dollars of its treasury savings.

Understanding Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)Right now we are in our test-net and someone can perform task, become a council member and work in Working groups ans be rewarded with our native token. Our Mainnet is set to launch on 1st of December.

One of the major features of digital currencies is that they are [decentralized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp). This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank, but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks, and nodes. In many cases, virtual currencies make use of this decentralized status to attain levels of privacy and security that are typically unavailable to standard currencies and their transactions.

Inspired by the decentralization of cryptocurrencies, a group of developers came up with the idea for a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, in 2016.1 The concept of a DAO is to promote oversight and management of an entity similar to a corporation. However, the key to a DAO is the lack of central authority; the collective group of leaders and participants act as the governing body.

How does Joystream Work?

Joystream rely heavily on smart contracts. These logically coded agreements dictate decision-making based on underlying activity on a blockchain. For example, based on the outcome of a decision, certain code may be implemented to increase the circulating supply, burn of a select amount of reserve tokens, or issue select rewards to existing tokenholders.The voting process for Joystream is posted on a blockchain. Users must often select between mutually-exclusive options. Voting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user that owns 100 tokens of the DAO will have twice the weight of voting power over a user that owns 50 tokens.

The theory behind this practice is users who are more monetarily invested in Joystream are incentivized to act in good faith. Imagine a user who owns 25% overall voting power. This user can participate in bad acts; however, by doing so, the user will jeopardize the value of their 25% holding.

Joystream has a treasury that house tokens that can be issued in exchange for fiat. Members of the DAO can vote on how to use those funds; for example, some DAOs with the intention of acquiring rare [NFTs](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211) can vote on whether to relinquish treasury funds in exchange for assets.

Joystream initially raises capital by trading fiat for its native token. This native token represents voting power and ownership proportion across members. If a Joystream is successful, the value of the native token will increase. Joystream can then issue future tokens at a greater value to raise more capital. it can also invest in assets if the members decide to approve such measures. For an example, a DAO can acquire companies, NFTs, or other tokens. Should those assets appreciate in value, the value of the DAO increases.Joystream is intended to improve the traditional management structure of many companies. Instead of relying on a single individual or small collection of individuals to guide the direction of the entity, a DAO intends to give every member a voice, vote, and opportunity to propose initiatives. A DAO also strives to have strict governance that is dictated by code on a blockchain.Unlike traditional organizations, Joystream has an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At Joystream development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code.
