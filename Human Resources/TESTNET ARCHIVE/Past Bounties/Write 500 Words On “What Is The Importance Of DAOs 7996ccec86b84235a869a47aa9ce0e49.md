**What is the importance of DAOs?**

Decentralised autonomous organisations, or DAOs, are online organisations that are jointly owned and managed by their members. A DAO is a new and effective approach to organisation management. More and more projects belong to a DAO, such as Uniswap, Apecoin, Joystream and many others. DAO actually solves a lot of nuances and problems. Let’s find out what the importance of DAO is all about.

DAO is a new approach to organization management, which helps to bypass the shortcomings of traditional business structures. DAO is the answer to classical business schemes, in which the control of the company is owned by a small group of people, and sometimes even by one person. This approach has many disadvantages, such as not taking into account the views of all members of the organisation. An autonomous decentralised organisation has no hierarchical structure, so a single group or control centre cannot make decisions that ignore the interests of the other participants. DAO, on the contrary, helps to consider the opinion of each participant and vote on the future of the project that has the tokens of that blockchain. DAO relies on the community to make decisions: any participant can propose improvements to the decentralised protocol, and if the rest of the community votes for them, they will be accepted. The full automation of blockchain systems allows votes to be cast with provable integrity and the decisions of the organisation’s members to be executed.

One of the most important principles of DAO is the absence of hierarchy and decentralisation: all participants are equally investors, co-founders and contributors. Transparency is also a core principle of FAO: open source code that anyone can view. In blockchain, anyone can view the history to see how decisions were made. This transparency is provided by blockchain. DAO allows for savings. DAO is a decentrally managed organisation. It can be used to get rid of the management staff through automation of systems. As a result, project organisers can save money on salaries.

DAO is also characterised by its autonomy and high speed of operation through automation of systems. With DAO, there is no need to wait for a secretary to process a request and find the information of interest for operations. The automation of the system enables quick decision-making and resolution of issues. Also in decentralised autonomous systems there is a very low error rate due to the absence of the human factor. DAO users need not fear that some absent-minded manager will mishandle transactions. One of the features and importance of DAO is accessibility, i.e. it is easier to become a member of DAO than, for example, to get a seat on the board of directors of a classic organization. DAOs allow companies to build quality systems to solve business problems in other ways. Because of this, traditional organisations may well abandon the hierarchical structure in favour of DAOs, which can save money, simplify and speed up many processes and eliminate the problems associated with trusting a centralised approach.

While DAO is still evolving, it is likely that in the future there will be platforms that can partially or even completely replace many of the current organisations.

With DAO, a new and efficient governance order is created, and blockchain projects achieve perfect decentralisation. By conducting transactions autonomously via smart contracts, DAOs offer many benefits to all stakeholders, as well as enabling decisions that can be rewarded accordingly as DAOs grow. Addressing their challenges, more and more traditional organisations are looking to implement decentralised management into their business to automate and make certain aspects of their operations more efficient.

To summarise, the most basic and fundamental importance of DAO is that it helps address and circumvent all the shortcomings of traditional organisations. FAO is our future, a super-efficient tool for classical business models to improve their operations.
