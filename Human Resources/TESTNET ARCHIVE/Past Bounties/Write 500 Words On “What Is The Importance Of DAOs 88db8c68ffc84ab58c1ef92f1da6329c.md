# **Importance of DAOs**

The purest definition of a DAO is inherent in the name. An organization is a group of people and entities with a common goal or idea. It’s decentralized, so there is no CEO or board of executives responsible for decision-making, and it’s autonomous, meaning it’s self-governing. Self-governing means that there are governance rules programmed into blockchain-based smart contracts, and members of the DAO vote on matters affecting the DAO according to those rules. DAOs include Joystream , Longwave, Uniswap and ether among others. Joystresm in particular is a rising organization where members get paid in native tokens known as the Joystrean tJOY after completing bounties.logothe advantages of daoGuides James Howell on April 29, 2022What Are The Advantages Of A DAO?The explosive growth and advantages of DAOs in recent years have spurred a lot of interest in DAO.

Among the many opportunities evolving in this space, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have been gaining a lot of traction.

Developed with the vision for creating internet-native organizations under the ownership and control of the members, DAOs offer favorable prospects for capitalizing on the benefits of crypto and benefits of blockchain. The advantages of DAO speak loads of the value they bring to the table. How are DAOs a significant entity in the rapidly expanding crypto and blockchain ecosystem?

Background of DAOsThe first thing you need before reflecting on the top DAO benefits is a clear understanding of what a DAO actually is. Take note of the fact that even if DAOs have turned out on almost every crypto discussion forum in recent times, they have been around since 2016. The design of the first-ever DAO showcases an overview of the definition of decentralized autonomous organizations. Developed as an automated and decentralized organization, the first-ever DAO worked as a venture capital fund.

However, the organization did not have headquarters in any posh locality or a board of directors. On the contrary, the DAO was developed on the basis of open-source code without the conventional centralized management structures. Why build a DAO in the first place? While the pros of DAO can set clear reasons for using them now, what could have inspired the first-ever DAO?

Importance of DAOsThe term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clearly evident answers for your doubts. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete decentralization. Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs leverage blockchain for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

DAOs don’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business and entity is vested in the group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals. Multiple DAOs with popular examples such as Curve DAO, MakerDAO, and others have encouraged many developers and business owners to opt for DAOs. What is the reason behind the demand for DAOs?

Benefits of DAOsIf you are seeking answers to “What are the advantages of a DAO?” then you are most likely to come across multiple answers. In addition, you can also expect that the benefits of DAOs would gradually increase over the course of time for particular use cases. Blockchain technology is gradually improving in terms of user-friendliness, and users are seeking ways to active participation in DAOs. Here is an outline of advantages associated with DAOs, which are driving attention towards them.

DecentralizationThe foremost highlight of the advantages of DAO focuses on decentralization, an essential trait of decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs focus on achieving the maximum extent of decentralization according to their basic design principles. The concept of complete decentralization generally loses value in other endeavors. However, the equation changes in the case of DAOs which rely on collective participation rather than depending on one individual.

In the case of a traditional publicly-traded company, the CEO and the board of directors have the final say in decision making and other initiatives by the company. As a result, employees, users, and customers don’t come into the picture when thinking about the future direction of an organization. Another significant answer for “what are the advantages of a DAO?” would refer to the scope for community involvement. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs introduce the facility for communities all over the world to connect with each other and work on productive goals together. Anyone can enter the world of web3 with just an internet connection and governance tokens of a DAO.

Participation in DAO delivers the unique value advantage of contributing to new projects such as creating new domains like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or new play-to-earn cryptocurrencies. In addition, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also reflect how DAO participants can have a sense of ownership. As a result, they can drive members for innovation and set new precedents for financial rewards in return for participation.

Every member of a DAO has unique privileges for shaping the future of the organization. Stakeholders in a DAO can submit proposals for improvement and changes in protocols. The most important thing here is that DAOs don’t restrict the decision-making privileges to the boardroom. With promising inputs from multiple members of the DAO, the organization can introduce innovative developments.
