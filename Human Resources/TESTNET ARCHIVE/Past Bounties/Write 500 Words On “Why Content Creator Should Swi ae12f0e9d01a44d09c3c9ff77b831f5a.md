Hi all. Today I want to talk about why all content makers should switch to Atlas and discuss with you the advantages and disadvantages of this application.

Atlas is a video platform where content makers can post their content. I think you’ll ask immediately, why should I switch from my native YouTube to Atlas? It’s not at the top of the app rankings for video content usage. Atlas is called decentralized youtube very often, which means there shouldn’t be much difference between these two apps. So why should we use it at all, and why should we switch to the app which is not widely used by the people?

First of all, we mean a decentralized video platform when we talk about Atlas, where any ordinary user who knows how to shoot a little on camera can become a successful and recognizable blogger. Primarily, the main advantage of Atlas is the level playing field for all new users. YouTube has already huge number of channels with a lot of subscribers, almost every niche is already occupied. Therefore, it is a very difficult to compete with such serious opponents. In turn, Atlas gives everyone the opportunity to start from scratch. It is very important in the competitive world today. There is a very interesting expression: from dirt to riches. So this case is exactly about Atlas.

Secondly, Atlas offers tremendous opportunities for monetizing content. You have to agree that not every video platform allows you to create a channel with your own token. The video makers can upload their content and get paid for it. The main conditions are standard, that the content does not contain forbidden topics, should be of high quality and educational topics, which are liked by other users. The payment is a very dependent on the category of the uploaded content. For example, in testnet, the video maker is paid more for the instructional video of the English lesson or the cooking recipe videos than for the video of some travel or party. Atlas allows you to create not only your own channel, but also the token for your channel so that other users can buy the content. It is also possible to convert videos into NFTs and sell them. You can sell NFTs for a fixed price, via an auction, and receive the royalty every time your NFT is re-sold. Other users can buy your tokens and thus have a stake in your channel and benefit from the development of your channel.

As for the disadvantages, Atlas is still a young video platform that is developing and does not have huge popularity yet. It is our task to help promote this promising application and benefit from its development.

I would like to summarize, Atlas is a new emerging video platform, which has many advantages. Firstly, it is an opportunity to get paid for downloading quality video content. Secondly, it is an opportunity to monetize the content that you uploaded to your channel through the sale of NTFs and tokens of your channel. So, every active beginner video maker and not only should join Atlas.
