Web 3.0 is focused on ownership of user data. The most valuable data is, funding data. The financial and property part of this is still underestimated in today’s centralized Web 2.0 solutions.

With excellent reward distribution, resistance to censorship and immunity to interference from large organizations.

Today’s web 2.0 is messed up. Content creation platforms serve their owners, not users. By creating Joystream, users will have a chance to monetize their video content and use it properly in the development of the joystream, while at the same time they will be able to enjoy the benefits of staking JOY tokens. And the most important thing to decentralize points of view — is the Joystream governance system, which will be completely under the control of the Joystream DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). And this is the main thing in Web 3.0!
