# **Why Content Creator Should Switch To Atlas?**

The Atlas app is a content creator’s paradise. It is designed with writers in mind and offers all the tools they need to create high-quality content at scale. The AI assistant will help them maintain their workflow and stay on track with deadlines, so that they can focus on what matters most — creating great content.

In the future, online content will exist in a model similar to the web 3.0 — every post and piece of content you make will be decentralised using blockchain technology, so you’ll be able to own it entirely.No one will be able to remove your information (posts, videos, content) from the sites, it will forever remain in the blockchain network.

Currently, video content is the most popular among users. The reason why? They offer higher levels of entertainment and provide a greater level of communication than text. Another bonus is that video content appeals to both eyes and ears.In the present, the main platform for watching videos is Youtube. But, unfortunately, it has many disadvantages.

I used to visit more platforms like these quite regularly, but lately there have been a lot more ads. And they don’t seem to be slowing down. All of your work, videos, design, branding, subscribers, promotion, etc. can be blocked and deleted with a swipe of a moderator’s hand or the system itself automatically, often without the right to correct anything, and also often without announcing a clear reason. It is difficult to work with their internal video editing tools, you have to turn to third-party resources.

The process of uploading videos to the site, as well as rendering videos for the author, sometimes takes dozens of hours. Tough content creation rules. We all know about the strict moderation of video content on YouTube, and how many videos are deleted there. Users can’t like that, so decentralizing Joystream will help us solve this problem.

In addition, a huge advantage of the Joystream video platform is that it strives to provide video creators with alternative ways to monetize their videos, which is just incredibly amazing! Joystream’s main goal is to make media platforms accountable to the people they affect, which is primarily their users, whether they are consumers, creatives, third-party developers or employees.

The second significant benefit is that creators can create their own tokens and have their video mining in the form of non-functional tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain. With Joystream Atlas, it will be possible to make a living as a content creator in Joystream. Fortunately, there is a general battle plan you can pursue on the way to YouTube success.As a rookie creator, it can help you outpace the competition, and meet the challenges you’ll face along the way. Things are always easier to deal with when you have a plan from the start!

Web 3.0 future is bright and three will be more apps but not like th Joystream, it will be one of the leaders of future video streaming in web 3.0. Because it’s a DAO video platform, which means there are all kinds of ways you can join the project and make money by contributing to it.In a way, Joystream is the cool new equivalent of Youtube, allowing content makers to create content and monetize.
