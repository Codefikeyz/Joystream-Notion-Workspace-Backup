# **Joystream DAO**

In today’s web 2.0 centralized solutions, the financial and ownership aspects are still undervalued so now the focus of Web 3.0 !which is located is on user data ownership. But how about What about other relevant items like movies, songs, poems, articles, games, or live performances? Is there a place for them in the next improved online version?

Of course! For this we have Joystream — a substrate-based protocol to establish a shared content platform. Unlike other video platforms, it will be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) run and governed by its users.

**How Does Joystream DAO Work ?**

You can apply to becoming a council member, or vote in the council member election. You can upload a proposal to suggest a new idea, and it will be voted on by the council. You can use your ownership to get your say in the direction of the organization, and not in a theoretical way, but in actual on-chain voting that cannot be defrauded. Also, everything is transparent, and out in the open for anyone to see, including budget & salaries.

**In the Joystream, there are a variety of active roles:**

1. Validators
2. Members of the Council
3. Providers of Storage
4. Curators of content
5. Creators of Content

**Joystream currently have a little more than 30 Founding Members!**but they aim for something like 200, which still gives a lot of time and opportunities to contribute, so you can try yourself. Since the beginning, they tested two different models of the program and are still making a lot of improvements and experiments with everything. The goal is to create an effective and viable DAO by the time of mainnet, which is planned for august-september 2022!

**For other users** will have a reasonable possibility of monetizing their video content by creating Joystream. They will be able to reap the benefit of staking JOY tokens simultaneously.

**The governance management mechanism of Joystream**, which will be totally under the control of Joystream DAO, is also crucial from a decentralized standpoint (decentralized autonomous organization). And that is what Web 3.0 is all about!
