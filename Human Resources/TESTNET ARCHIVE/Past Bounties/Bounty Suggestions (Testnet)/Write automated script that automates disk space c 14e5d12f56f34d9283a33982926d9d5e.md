**Detailed scope of work:** We currently have document that describes cleanup process: [JS Disk Cleanup - Google](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqh_HRX1V9erIeu6aR1FwlsLlHPtjkg0uFUtxYSGLXk/edit) . It requires performing manual steps. However it would be great to have automated tool that does all actions automatically. It will save time & efforts of each of node operator + ensure that a single cleanup procedure is in place
