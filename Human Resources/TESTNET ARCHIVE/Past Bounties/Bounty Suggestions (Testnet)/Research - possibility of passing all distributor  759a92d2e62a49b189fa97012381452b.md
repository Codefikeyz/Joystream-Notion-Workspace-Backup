**High level summary and purpose:** need to make research if it is possible to make outgoing (and maybe incoming) traffic routing for distributor Argus application via network interface that is set especially for this app

**Detailed scope of work:** Background for this task is a discussion started from [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1012689255165857834](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/933726271832227911/1012689255165857834) and onwards. We are looking for solution that would allow precise traffic measurement for the Argus application. What we are interested in is knowing the amount of useful payload sent/received by the distributor node. This should not include any traffic for any other applications, OS updates etc. And one of ideas is to rout all useful distributor payload via one dedicated interface.

Need to perform this setup.
