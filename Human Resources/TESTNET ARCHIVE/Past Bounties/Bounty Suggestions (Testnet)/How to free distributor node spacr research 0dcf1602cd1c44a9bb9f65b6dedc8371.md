**High level summary and purpose:** make research of how one can optimize space on distributor node by deleting some old data that does not have much value - like old logs etc.

**Detailed scope of work:** Sometimes picking a node is a tradeoff between price and performance. In some cases distributors can be short on free space. Especially in a long running perspective - blockchain ig growing and space disappearing little-by-little. Need to make research on examining a node and figuring out how one could free some space without impacting node preformance in distributor network.
