# **DİFFERENCE BETWEEN JOYSTREAM AND OTHER DAOS**

DAOs can be categorized into eight types:

1. Protocol DAOs

2. Grant DAOs

3. Philanthropy DAOs

4. Social DAOs

5. Collector DAOs

6. Venture DAOs

7. Media DAOs

8. SubDAOs

There are many kinds of DAOs, and we may not be able to cover them all. However, if you’re interested in creating your own DAO, let’s look at the most common kinds of DAOs.

**Protocol DAOs**

Protocol DAOs govern decentralized protocols such as borrow/lend applications, decentralized exchanges, or other types of decentralized applications.

Protocol DAO Examples:

MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Yearn Finance are three examples of protocol DAOs.

**Grant DAOs**

In the DeFi space, Grant DAOs facilitate nonprofit donations, deploy capital assets strategically throughout the ecosystem, and may be charitable extensions of larger projects or entirely separate entities.

Grant DAO Examples:

In addition to supporting a more comprehensive network of community developers, AAVE Grants DAO funds ideas and projects that power the development of AAVE Protocol.

Eligible grant submissions include, but are not limited to AAVE development, integrations, developer tools, and others.

**Philanthropy DAOs**

Philanthropy DAOs aim to create impact in the world of Web3 by organizing around a shared purpose.

Philanthropy DAO Examples:

UkraineDAO raised over $3 million in ETH in less than a week to support the Ukrainian Army thanks to Web3.

**Social DAOs**

Creator DAOs, or social DAOs, promote the self-organizing community aspect of DAOs by bringing together like-minded individuals such as builders, artists, and creatives.

Creator DAO Examples:

We are a collective of web3 developers focused on building the future of web3. Each member of Developer DAO must hold a genesis NFT or be invited to the private Discord server.

**Collector DAOs**

Members of Collector DAOs pool funds together so that the collective community can invest Treasury funds in blue chip NFT art and other collectibles. Each member owns a share.

**Investment and Venture DAOs**

Invest in web3 startups, protocols, off-chain investments, and get access to portfolios not available in traditional finance with venture DAOs.

**Media DAOs**

By creating content driven by the community, Media DAOs reinvent traditional media platforms that are dominated by top-down approaches or influenced by advertisers.

Media DAO Examples:

As a decentralized community, Joystream DAO coordinates and propagates NFT and media. As a critical tool for establishing common knowledge among societies, Joystream DAO believes that art is essential. The way values and narratives are financed, distributed, and paid for shapes culture, faith, and even public policy.

**Joystream DAO**

Recent years have seen the proliferation of digital media platforms as primary platforms for distributing expression, and they have become key institutions for coordinating activities of this type. Joystream DAO has been reduced to a few massive institutions that set the terms for how it works. Market and political mechanisms do not hold them accountable. Therefore, their terms determine how we tell stories, express ourselves, and interact with others. Because of this, inflexible monetization, censorship of controversial speech, inequitable gains among creators and audiences, low platform innovation, and lack of developer credibility persist. Joystram DAO believes that two fundamental challenges need to be addressed. Using contemporary distributed systems technology, such as blockchains, smart contracts, and tokens, is the most effective means to accomplish this.
