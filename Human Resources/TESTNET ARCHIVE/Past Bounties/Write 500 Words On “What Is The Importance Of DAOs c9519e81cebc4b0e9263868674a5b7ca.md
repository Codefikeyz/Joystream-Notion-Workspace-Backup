[A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization which has no central authority.](https://medium.com/@zionumeh123/a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-is-an-organization-which-has-no-central-authority-d032ec8117f1)

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization which has no central authority. Decision gets made from the bottom-up, governed by a community of like-minded people, organized around rules enforced on a blockchain. Members of the DAO own native tokens of the DAO. They earn such tokens by completing certain tasks for the organization, although some of these tokens can also be bought. Members of a DAO also have the privilege of voting on initiatives for the entity. In terms of rules, smart contracts are implemented for the DAO, and the governing codes of conduct of the DAO’S operations are publicly disclosed for all members to be aware. In short, a DAO is an internet-native organization that is collectively owned and managed by its members in strict adherence to the set of rules governing the entity. Some examples of DAOs include; Uniswap, LexDAO, BitDAO, Joystream among so many others. The Joystream DAO is one of the fastest rising DAOs with members from different countries across the globe. Members of the JoystreamDAO own tokens known as tjoy.

SMART CONTRACTS ?

Smart contracts are essentially digital contracts that are stored on the blockchain, and they execute themselves automatically. This is the autonomous part of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). How can a smart contract execute? There are terms and conditions on any contract we sign, this means that upon completion of the agreed work, someone will have to approve your timesheet and as well approve payment before it is handed to you, but with smart contracts, there is no manager or person who needs to check your timesheet and approve your payments. Instead, the just does it all by itself. Automatically it will release your funds to you once your task has been successfully completed.

**IMPORTANCE OF DAOs**

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are very important in so many ways, ranging from instant trust and transparency to use of smart contracts. In this section, the various importance of DAOs will be discussed.

One major importance of DAOs is that they operate through a computer code unlike traditional organizations that are run by specific leaders. The DAO’s blockchain-based governance ensures that no single individual controls the community, thereby making decisions faster and more transparent. Most DAOs like Joystream, Uniswap and LexDAO also operate on a computer code. Another notable importance of DAO is its use of smart contracts. They derive their consensus through digital contracts that existence on the blockchain spine. These virtual contracts are self-executing and contain immutable data that are tamperproof.

The best thing about DAOs is that they offer immediate trust and transparency for entities to focus on achieving their collective interests. The participants don’t need to know each other as the rules of engagement are embedded in a transparent, safe blockchain record. A final importance of DAOs is that they are community based. Members of DAOs who own tokens have the right to vote on matters concerning the organization. For instance, in Joystream members who own tJOY have the privilege of voting on certain matters.
