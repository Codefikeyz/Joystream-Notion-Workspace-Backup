**What/Who are content Creators?**

A content creator is someone who creates entertaining or educational material to be expressed through any medium or channel.

Content creation especially pertains to digital content, since that’s where the majority of content is consumed (and where the money is, if you’re looking to earn revenue through your efforts).

For businesses, content creation can mean crafting newsletters, emails, digital marketing materials, brochures, social media, articles, annual reports, advertorial, editorial, and company communications, and more.

To fully understand what a content creator is and does, it’s important to understand what “content” is.

In the publishing, communication, and art industries, content can be defined as all the information and experiences, such as writing, speech, or other various arts, expressed through a medium to communicate value to an end user.

More important for business, content is the stuff that users, readers, or viewers derive value from. Nowadays, video content is the most popular among users. But have you ever wondered why?! Video offers a higher degree of entertainment and deeper interaction with the speaker because of the inclusion of non-verbal communication. Another bonus is that the video content catches both the eye and ears.

In a Web2 space, we have several video platforms that share content of any kind. We use them for crypto-related videos and streams as well as for day-to-day entertaining purposes. But like every other Web2 product, they lack centralization, censorship, and data exclusivity that goes hand in hand with monetization.

When building Web3 space, there is a huge need for the video streaming platform, which will be completely decentralized and owned by the users, not by any multinational corporation, which sets rules and monetizes for itself while distributing only a portion of its rewards to the content creators themselves. Joystream is a substrate-based video blockchain that aims to formalize a shared content platform. Compared to the video platforms we know today, Joystream is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is operated and governed by its users. Atlas, the consumer-facing video dApp, lets creators upload videos to their channel, build up subscriber count, enable selling videos as NFTs, or tokenizing their channel, which can help people to engage and share the revenue of the upside.

Atlas: a video platform of the future

Atlas is a video platform similar to the ones you know from the Web2 world. But it brings new and exciting monetization options for the users and especially content creators.

**Monetization options in Joystream**

There are 2 different ways, in which creators can monetize their work: video NFTs and creator tokens.

**Video NFTs**

Videomakers can list any of their videos for sale as an NFT, which can be then sold on the secondary market with royalties on each sale. The NFT sale on Joystream can use any of the 3 types of auctions:

English auction with a predefined end date

Open auction without a predefined end date

Buy now auction, which will take place immediately if the buyer reaches the price requested by the seller. We call for an arrangement where media platforms are accountable to the people they impact, which are primarily their users, be it as consumers, creatives, third party developer or workers.
