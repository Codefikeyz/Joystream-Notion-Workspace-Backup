# **Joystream. History and achievements of DAOs**

I think many of you have heard of Joystream, which is a substrate-based protocol that aims to formalize a shared content platform. But what is the main difference with other well-known video platforms? And the answer is DAO.

The term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clearly evident answers for your doubts. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-government/). Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

So, let’s remember how the era of DAO began.

The DAO was a venture capital fund, founded in April of 2016, that ran as a DApp, or decentralized application, on the Ethereum blockchain network. Anyone could join by sending any amount of ether to the DAO’s smart contract. Then, they would receive tokens representing their amount of equity in return. Not only would these tokens allow investors to vote, but they could also be traded on the secondary market like a stock.

The way it was structured, new blockchain-based ventures could apply for funding, and token holders could vote on whether or not to fund those ventures. Once the vote passed, money would automatically be dispersed to the project from the community treasury. Once they made money, profits would automatically be sent back to the token holders. Each of these transactions would be executed via smart contracts, leading to an efficient exchange each and every time. New investors flocked to it, relishing this new technology that would allow them to see their money moving and growing in real time.

In a matter of weeks, the DAO raised more than $150 million. Once the DAO’s tokens were added to cryptocoin exchanges, they also began surging in value, making this one of the most successful and exciting moments of the blockchain era up until that point.

So, decentralized autonomous organizations have become an answer to traditional business models in which control of a business is owned by a small group of people, and sometimes by a single person.

DAO helps to “hear” everyone’s opinion. The full automation of blockchain systems allows at the same time to vote with demonstrable honesty and to execute the decisions of the members of the organization.

In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals.

Furthermore, DAOs leverage [blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-technology-explained/) for defining the voting powers for members in proposals for shaping up the future of the organization or project. At the same time, decentralized autonomous organization advantages also present critical components for the web3 landscape. Therefore, DAO is a compelling choice for anyone interested in developing solutions in the present consumer-centric environments.

Also, DAO is about economy. With DAO’s help, you can get rid of the managerial staff through system automation. As a result, project organizers will be able to save on salaries. High speed of work due to system automation. In DAO, there is no need to wait for the secretary to process the application and find the information of interest for the operation.

In conclusion, DAO is a new approach to managing an organization that helps overcome the shortcomings of traditional business structures.
