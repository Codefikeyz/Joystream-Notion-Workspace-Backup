# **Transformation of DAOs**

For decades, the internet has been an abstract concept with limited usability among government organizations and universities, allowing multiple computers to communicate with each other. In the early 1980s, communication protocols (TCP) and normalized systems (DNS) led to the establishment of the Internet we know today.

After almost a decade, the world wide web took a more recognizable form with the advent of transfer protocols (HTTP), an invention credited to scientists, engineers, and programmers dedicated to providing users with an “information superhighway.”

The web enabled public access to internet-based data in its initial form. Web1 is characterized by hyperlinks that link content and information with limited interaction. Today’s global internet is still powered by technologies like Google and Yahoo, which are powered by Web1.0.

By the early 2000s, various web protocols enabled read-and-write interactions, which enabled programs to interact with content. With Web2, the version of the web most familiar to readers, users are able to consume and produce content. In response to its autonomy in content creation, blogs, internet forums, and marketplaces emerged, which paved the way for social networks.

Despite the tremendous benefits that Web2 has provided for users, rent-seeking centralized entities have exploited this free flow of information to monetize user data and behaviors. Due to breaches of trust assumptions, user exploitation, and data lock-up, a web owned by users and builders is necessary.

With Web3, decentralized protocols are used to promote open services, unlike centralized applications controlled by tech giants. Users can use Web3 to link programs directly with content, bypassing central intermediaries, and to read, write, and own their own content. In Web3-based open services, permissionless participation is promoted, value is optimized, and verifiability is guaranteed. These services are also more resilient, ethical, and fair.

DAOs are organizations run by a group of individuals who establish their own governance and execute smart contracts on the blockchain. With DAOs, there is no central entity or single point of control — instead, users with similar interests work together toward a common goal. An open blockchain supports Web3 principles with all contracts, decisions, and transactions publicly viewable and verifiable — and individuals remain owners.

DAOs provide a governance structure for Web3 that boosts participation and reduces corruption and censorship, from social media DAOs like Friends with Benefits to governance DAOs within the play-to-earn gaming space. As DAOs become increasingly popular, nonprofits, decentralized finance, and NFT collections will follow suit. DAOs also allow decisions to be made instantly, without being slowed down by hierarchical structures.

The DAO structure stands to benefit charities greatly. Administrative tasks and fund allocation decisions often take up more time and money than charitable activities do. As a result, charities are able to increase the impact of their end causes by distributing funds quickly and effectively through DAO implementations.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) can also be accelerated through DAOs as a direct channel for investments. With cryptocurrencies, DAOs enable peer-to-peer transactions without the hassle of traditional financial institutions. Compared to traditional financial institutions, members can generate more returns through lending or transaction fees. In the near future, this space will continue to grow rapidly.

In the past, daos consisted of communities that only produced products on a particular subject. For example, there were DAOs established by people who were specialized in AMMs, NFTs or ICOs. But that changed with Joystream DAO. Joystream DAO provided us a new “Video Streaming Application”, and become a good example of how DAOs have changed by enabling us to set up our own streaming environment and broadcast our videos on the blockchain, as well as mint and sell NFTs, create our own token and make our ICOs.You can find detailed information about the platform from the link: [https://dao.joystream.org/](https://dao.joystream.org/)
