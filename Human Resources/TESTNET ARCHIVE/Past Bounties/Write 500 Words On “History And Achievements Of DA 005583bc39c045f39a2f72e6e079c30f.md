# **History and achievements of DAOs**

What is DAO? How does it work? While answering the questions, the role of DAO in Ethereum bifurcation, the relationship of DAO with Blockchain and NFT games, and what are the promises of DAOs for brands? Let’s take a look.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which we often hear about today, can transport us to a new interaction environment. Especially when DAOs are associated with Metaverse, it is expected to open the doors to new ways of doing business and management. Let’s examine Decentralized Autonomous Organizations together.

**What is DAO?**

In fact, we first conveyed the details of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which was created on the ethereum blockchain in 2018, to you.

We can define DAOs as entities that are managed by the community and do not have a central authority.

These decentralized organizations; It ensures that the in-house basic rules are processed into the code, allowing these rules to function under normal conditions. In addition, it aims to eliminate the extra cost and manpower created by process control.

**How do DAOs work?**

To explain a little more, the rules and laws of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are written into the source code of DAOs. Here, we can think that we have moved to a stage where the rules written on paper are now written into code. This set of rules and laws in the source code is processed through a consensus-based algorithm and by thousands of “nodes”. In a sense, it is possible to talk about a self-managing system. However, this system is open to change. In order for a change to be made in the DAO, the community must vote on the change to be made.

It is not much different from the operation of a company under normal conditions. But in DAO, the rules cannot be easily changed by a person because they are encoded in the code.

Moreover, they can be used not only in internal or external financial transactions, but also in every stage where decision mechanism is required in the company. Shareholders can vote on many issues such as rule change, addition or removal of new rule. In short, we can call it a cryptographically guaranteed democracy.

At this point, let’s repeat the example we gave in 2018. Let’s consider electric and driverless vehicles belonging to a taxi company. A vehicle in the fleet searches for passengers by navigating, picks up the passenger and leaves them at the desired place, and receives the payment via crypto payment method. To recharge, it finds the nearest charging station, recharges itself and pays again with crypto payment method, then starts touring again for the next passenger.

**First DAO project: The DAO**

Introduced some time after the creation of bitcoin in 2009, the DAO consisted of an intellectually supported concept in the first place. The first DAO project was The DAO, which was launched in 2016 and bears the same name as the DAO. The open source code for The DAO was written by Christoph Jentzsch. It was developed by a software team. Among the prominent names in the team were Stephan Tual and Simon Jentzsch. The project, as we often saw in ICOs at that time; He was planning to fund himself with a token sale. Those who bought the tokens would be positioned as the investor of the project.

The project, which sold 11 thousand tokens in a month, received an Ethereum investment equivalent to 150 million dollars. However, things did not turn out as expected.

**Hacking The DAO**

The fact that these intangible codes could not be easily changed by a single person or minority in terms of security increased the attractiveness of the DAO idea. However, it also brought with it a structure that could have bad consequences. Because if someone caught a bug in the code, it was unlikely that the developers would intervene or change it immediately.

The problem with The DAO attempt was at this point. In June 2016, the hacker targeting The DAO project found a vulnerability that allowed him to repeatedly withdraw DAO tokens before the smart contract could control his own account. So he quickly drained all the funds. Founders and investors watched 3.6 million Ether go away at that time. Technically, the hacker who followed the rules in the code didn’t have to do anything extra.

**The role of the DAO in the Ethereum fork**

The solution offered to recover this outgoing value caused another nuisance. Ethereum main developers gave back the money of the participants by reversing the transfer transactions from the main blockchain. However, this recovery approach and the fact that the developers interfered with the main blockchain in this way disturbed a large part of the users. This stance went against the “code is the law” approach widely adopted by developers. As a result of these discussions and voting, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum forked took place on July 20, 2016.

**NFT and DAOs are back on the agenda**

The irrepressible rise of the NFT market has brought DAOs back to the agenda. Among the prominent examples we can cite Nouns DAO and KeeperDAO. Bree, who also describes herself as an “NFT asset factory” Don’t forget derDAO. If you remember, the venture received an investment of 10 million dollars in the A series investment tour led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Delphi Digital.

Yet the rise of NFTs is not the only factor in the resurgence of DAOs. The interest shown in the games along with the Covid-19 and quarantine processes also had an impact on the DAO’s place in the table.

While the gaming industry started to become the focal point with the investments it received in 2021, we all started to agree that the future content will be games, with content companies such as Netflix developing their own gaming platforms.

**What do DAOs promise for brands?**

To me, DAOs make a difference in two areas. The first of these; integrating a feedback mechanism into the management system of games, applications, digital products or newly established structures. DAOs enable a company to get feedback directly from its user base beyond testers. Users can request certain features or be involved in decision-making processes in interface design.

This will play a critical role in the success of the developed applications. Initiatives acting in line with the votes may face higher usage rates. Also, considering that Gen Z values ”transparency”, companies that appeal to younger audiences can benefit from DAO.

Community-oriented commerce and community management have been on the agenda of brands in recent years. Building a community in the DAO format allows the brand to be involved in the daily life of the user, while fostering a sense of community on the consumer side.

Above all, DAOs create economic value for brands, individuals and communities through tokens. It becomes easier for individuals, institutions and brands to fund themselves.

# **what about joystream?**

joystream has been progressing with strong names since 2018. You can feel that all these DAO processes are analyzed well and correctly and eliminate any possible problems. If we think that it will go to the mainnet in Q4 2022, a preparation period of almost 4 years seems to indicate the existence of a team that works very well in their lesson. It smells to me like that. what do you think?
