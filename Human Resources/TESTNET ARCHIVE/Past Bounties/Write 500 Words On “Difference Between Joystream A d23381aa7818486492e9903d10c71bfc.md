What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.Joystream is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

Difference between joystream and other daosoystream rely heavily on smart contracts. These logically coded agreements dictate decision-making based on underlying activity on a blockchain. For example, based on the outcome of a decision, certain code may be implemented to increase the circulating supply, burn of a select amount of reserve tokens, or issue select rewards to existing tokenholders.The voting process for Joystream is posted on a blockchain. Users must often select between mutually-exclusive options. Voting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user that owns 100 tokens of the DAO will have twice the weight of voting power over a user that owns 50 tokens.Joystream initially raises capital by trading fiat for its native token. This native token represents voting power and ownership proportion across members. If a Joystream is successful, the value of the native token will increase. Joystream can then issue future tokens at a greater value to raise more capital. it can also invest in assets if the members decide to approve such measures. For an example, a DAO can acquire companies, NFTs, or other tokens. Should those assets appreciate in value, the value of the DAO increases.Joystream is intended to improve the traditional management structure of many companies. Instead of relying on a single individual or small collection of individuals to guide the direction of the entity, a DAO intends to give every member a voice, vote, and opportunity to propose initiatives. A DAO also strives to have strict governance that is dictated by code on a blockchain.Unlike traditional organizations, Joystream has an even organizational structure with zero management. Within the organization, each token-holder has voting rights. At Joystream development stage, one of the code rules indicates the voting power is dependent on the number of tokens one holds. No member has any additional privileges or rights other than others. So, an experienced ethereum development company understands this requirement before creating the code.

Benefits of a Joystream.With opportunities and growth in DAO ever expanding, it is important to note the advantages and disadvantages that come with it.

TransparencyTraditional organizations keep much of their operations internal, but Joystream are operated on a decentralized blockchain network where processes and transactions are transparent, stored permanently, and are viewable by the public.

DemocratizationAll members of a Joystream can vote on moves and changes, which encourages accountability and careful thinking among members. This creates a flat, fair and equal organization without the hierarchy hurdles. Joystream members vote directly to make moves, changes and developments within the organization rather than electing members to make decisions on their behalf.

AutomationJoystream rules are embedded codes in the blockchain. As the program runs, the rules are enforced without the labor, manipulation, discrimation, or errors associated with human intervention.

Removal of Third party institutionsMembers can carry out transactions without the help and cost of outside institutions such as regulatory bodies, law practitioners, and other middlemen.

If for example members want to invest in a start-up or change the code of the program they run, DAOs can directly execute these plans via voting and subvert the need for banks, legal counsels and other mediators.
