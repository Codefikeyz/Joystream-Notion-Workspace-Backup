# **The Issues Of DAO**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAO — is a new method for creating autonomous self-governing organizations with a decentralized structure. The operations of an organization depend on a certain set of rules encoded in a smart contract.As a result, DAOs eliminate the need for traditional hierarchies and intermediaries in running an organization. DAOs depend on collective organizational decision making through decentralized governance.

Cons of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations:As revolutionary as DAOs seem, they have certain drawbacks and limitations. If you are looking for new perspectives for the implementation of decentralized autonomous organizations, you should also notice their pitfalls. The following list of DAO disadvantages may help you learn more about the critical implications of DAO.Concentration of voicesDecentralized governance in the DAO largely depends on the ownership of DAO tokens. Although DAOs are designed to provide unhindered access, a certain group of investors can accumulate the main shares of DAO tokens. As a result, they will receive a higher voting right depending on the number of management tokens they have.

What if the people with the largest share of management tokens vote for unsubstantiated proposals? Does the DAO structure completely eliminate the hierarchy problem? Thus, the disadvantages of a decentralized autonomous organization begin with problems related to hierarchy in the DAO structure.

**Transaction time**You probably thought that a community-based model was a positive thing for the DAO. However, this can prove to be a serious setback for the organization in the event of unforeseen situations. For example, you cannot implement any changes to the DAO without voting mechanisms.

In addition, voting mechanisms take time, and you may have to wait quite a considerable time for each transaction in the DAO. Imagine that the DAO requires immediate modification of the smart contract code to eliminate a security vulnerability. It is impossible to make any changes to the code without the consent of all the members of the DAO. As a result, the organization may lose valuable time solving problems related to a security breach.

**Regulatory implications**A description of the various shortcomings of the DAO would be incomplete without reference to regulatory requirements. Decentralized autonomous organizations can turn out to be a regulatory nightmare, especially due to the lack of any specific rules and regulations on taxation and DAO management. The general aspect of the advantages and disadvantages of the DAO points to the critical consequences of decentralized governance.

The community-based model not only increases transaction time and voting process, but also removes some responsibility. How? Isn ‘t accountability an important advantage of decentralized autonomous organizations ? Well, the DAO does not have a single person responsible for all the decisions of the organization. Therefore, it is quite difficult to implement any rules and regulations for decentralized autonomous organizations.

**Vulnerability of the DAO code**Another important entry in the list of disadvantages of a decentralized autonomous organization relates to dependence on the smart contract code. Most DAOs focus on the idea that the smart contract code will take care of everything. DAOs obviously offered unreliable environments, although they depended on the authenticity and validity of the smart contract code.

Now it is important to note that every code is vulnerable, and even DAOs can deploy code with certain vulnerabilities. Thus, the code controlling the DAO may become a serious obstacle to its growth in the future.

**Result**The final impression of the pros and cons of TAO suggests that you should take into account both positive and negative aspects equally. In fact, most of the disadvantages of the DAO are related to the advantages of the DAO, such as decentralization and transparency. For example, a community-based model is responsible for limiting the speed of transactions and the time required to transmit urgent offers.

I advise you to take a closer look at such a project as [Joystream](https://joystream.org/). I believe that this project can become one of the benchmarks for a decentralized system. Let’s be honest, many DAOs are not DAOs in the literal sense right now. Not everything is allowed to DAO participants — they only have a certain area that they can influence (for example, such DAOs include leading DeFi / lending protocols). Unfortunately, now the word DAO is very fashionable and there are some projects that devalue this word.
