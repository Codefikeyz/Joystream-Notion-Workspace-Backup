Write 500 words on “What are the issues of DAOs?”

Initially, cryptocurrencies were created. Since no one wants to take BTC or ETH for a loaf of bread, NFTs have been built. The COVID panzootic gave rise to the decline of loneliness, NFTs helped organize online communities that grew, spun and begged in the organization. Dispersed stand-alone companies (DAOs) seem to be a logical next step. DAO is how people rally into a category for the sake of making decisions in the digital world. They do this with the support of two paramount tools. First, the rules that govern an organization are expressed as a sort of series of numerical IF/THEN approvals, which are subsequently encoded naturally into the blockchain (making them both verifiable and permanent). Secondly, shares with the right to vote are exposed to the parties involved in something like “numerical control tokens”, which are signed on the blockchain. Such a transcendent entrance replaces both the legal abracadabra of the current systems (the rules are coded), and their hierarchical nature (everyone has the advantage of a vote).

In DAO, your output is driven by your employees

DAOs are trying to inject innovation into how people get paid. Whenever one organization (market, team, committee, management…) adopts a wage decree, this would be centralization and therefore unacceptable for the crypto community. Instead, interesting ideas are being tested, but the fact that communities are doing this emphasizes the prerogative of people functioning on dispersed projects.

Now the board revolves around a set of primary issues. Does the output correspond to the existence of a market one? Based on value? Based on employment? Organized for ethics? Are they guaranteed? Intimate in other words transparent? Single, variable, multilevel? Is it adjusted annually? adjusted for the market? Are increases likely? If so, should they be based on work experience, that is, experience? Combined with performance? DAOs cannot answer most of these questions.

In the DAO, opinions start by voting

The tokens issued to the involved parties of the DAO after the rendered services have 2 functions. They act as valuable shares that can be traded, and as ballots for the purpose of making decisions within the organization. I just described the public company promotion theory, but don’t talk about this Web3 mob; they get upset.

Proposals are naturally made following the principle “should we invest in G or J”, “should we base on blockchain B or E”, “should we allow person Y to participate”… Naturally, a majority is asked to accept the proposal. The motive of those who own the greatest number of tokens is louder, since the DAO, as a rule, utilizes the “1 token = 1 vote” instead of “1 person = 1 vote” smoothness. Generally speaking, it can be deduced from this that people who have the greatest number of tokens have the ability to sow a large amount due to abnormal conclusions after management and, therefore, are more involved. In fact, it seems to me that this is an elementary order for the founders to save control.

DAOs do not have personnel, charity insurance, or legal status.

DAOs are new concepts with vague legal status in most of the countries they operate in. They also refrain from explicitly conditioned roles, appreciating the thought of “appearing” to portray the work. These two use cases ensure that a large community plot cannot participate in the DAO (too risky). Which leads to several external effects.

- Except for the equivalent of the company’s Human Resources Department for one referee’s tooth. Consequently, incidents can increase and fractions can be freely selected. For this reason, the DAO tries to cover a regiment of people from all the dooms, except for the topics listed above. Trust and transparency, urgent for collaboration, are only likely after this, sometimes employees have a similar value construct. By comparison, the company is not a beggar in trust. He has to consume contracts.

DAOs Guarantee Irrelevant Certainty

I am sure that there are many advantages to registering the conclusions and services of a company on the blockchain for all to see (? But I do experience two immediate drawbacks of the desire for transparency at any cost.

First, the topographical linking of a wallet to a DAO means that it is possible for anyone and everyone to represent any transaction made with a given wallet. Rather, imagine if all of your employees could represent any transaction that goes in and out of your bank account, so that’s the one your brethren send your paycheck to. This would lead to chaos. Perhaps it would be possible to solve this problem by having different wallets, but it seems that now we do not have such a problem.
