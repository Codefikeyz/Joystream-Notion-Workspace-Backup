# **Write 500 words on “Transformation of DAOs”**

I think the key principle that we need to seriously think about is, I would say, moving from automation to autonomy. There has been a lot of discussion about the power of automation, robotic process automation.

It looks like magic, doesn’t it?

You know, you can take software and replace people and processes, really cut costs and improve efficiency. But a more interesting trend is beginning. What is the growth of autonomous organizations.

Have you ever wanted to buy the constitution of the United States? Or how about a fast food franchise? It is these items that have been undertaken or acquired by a new type of organization known as the DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Think of it like an online community with a shared bank account.

And DAOs built on blockchain are a key emerging infrastructure. which will be part

this new world of Web 3.0 decentralized communities, mostly with new types of control protocols.

DAO on Ethereum was the first implementation of DAO. What they did was basically a group of people who decided they wanted to put money into the fund as an investment. It was just a fund that invests in different projects and things.

They do it in such a decentralized way that people can choose, and so it’s a little different from a traditional fund. But a bunch of people that got together decided that they were all co-owners of this investment fund, and what ultimately happened was that there was a hack.

It actually cost the DAO, I think tens of millions of dollars in ETH, and so there was a big problem with the DAO, which was a technical issue. It ended up sort of breaking it all down and also forking the Ethereum blockchain, so the Ethereum blockchain as it is today wasn’t really the original blockchain, it was a fork.

But what I find really interesting when you think about the history of DAOs is that we had DAOs that basically served as investment type funds where you had this crypto way of investing. By crypto investing, I mean that instead of a fund that manages all that money, you have people who actually invest the money.

In essence, by being able to decide where they want to put that money, they own a very specific stake in the fund, but for some time this has been the main use case for the DAO. This is kind of the most obvious thing about pooling resources to create value, and one of the easiest ways to do this is to slowly invest capital, although DAOs have become a more interesting part of web3. We’ve started discovering new ways to co-create value that isn’t just about investing money, and now you’re starting to see a lot of different projects becoming DAOs and all that.

Basically, we’re finding new ways to collectively create and own things together, and so I think that’s where DAOs have been, and now we’re much more in the space of DAOs that can create media, DAOs can invest, DAOs can create products, DAOs can managing public goods has all these interesting new aspects of how we can collectively create value together, which I think was a nice evolution of the original DAO.

In turn, Joystream is a DAO of a new type. The main goal of its creation is not so much the competent distribution of the finances of a group of people, but the protection of the result of people’s cultural activities in the form of video from external factors. Modern video streaming platforms, which are run by a group of individuals pursuing their own interests, quite often change the provisions of their work and the rules for their users by restricting this or that content. In fact, their harmonious development has stopped.

Jetstream really brings something new to this area, it is a logical continuation of the development of the entire video streaming industry using the most modern approaches. By switching from classic video streaming hosting to Joystream, you can be confident in the future of your work, as you can be the person who participates in all decisions that determine the future of the platform itself and content. You are protected from all external factors thanks to blockchain technology, and a community of like-minded people is always ready to support you financially, as everyone knows that creating high-quality content involves high costs.

In the future, we will most likely see how the DAO will appear in new and new areas of human activity, cultural, which determines all its further development and not only cultural. Joystream in this is one of the first DAOs, leading the most important direction of human activity.
