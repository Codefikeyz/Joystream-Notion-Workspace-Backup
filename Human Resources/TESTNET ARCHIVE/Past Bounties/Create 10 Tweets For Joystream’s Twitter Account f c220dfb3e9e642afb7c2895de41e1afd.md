1. Joystream DAO are people who have come together and are working to create a decentralized platform. For work in the Joystram DAO project, you will receive tokens depending on the work done.
2. [$JOY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JOY&src=cashtag_click) tokens will only rise in price over time, as the system works in such a way that it is necessary to burn part of the tokens with a commission. Therefore, over time, [$JOY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JOY&src=cashtag_click) tokens will only become more expensive.
