# **ISSUES OF DAOs**

Issues with Daos

The tech community has a habit of making simple concepts difficult. This needn’t be the case. In short, DAOs are how humans come together as a group to make decisions in the digital world. They do so with the help of two key tools. Firstly, the rules that govern the organization such as joystream telegram and Joystream discord are expressed as a series of digital “IF/THEN” statements, that are then coded directly into a blockchain (thus rendering them both auditable and permanent). Secondly, voting shares are issued to stakeholders in the form of “digital governance tokens” — also recorded on a blockchain. Doing things this way replaces, in theory, both the legal mumbo-jumbo of today’s organizations (rules are coded) and their hierarchical nature (everyone has a voice).

Technically, all sorts of work structures can be created as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Investment companies, consulting companies, engineering companies… But that’s just the theory. Reality is much less kind.

Everything Wrong With DAOs

DAOs today don’t work. Below are the (many) reasons why.

I rather like DAOs: they borrow many of their core principles from organizational theory and have pushed forward interesting ideas around self-organization and emergence. Nevertheless, and without fail, everything the crypto community touches turns to poison. DAOs today don’t work. Below are the (many) reasons why.

1. In DAOs, your pay is decided by your peers

DAOs are trying to innovate on the way people get paid. Having one entity (the market, a team, a committee, leadership…) decide on salary would be centralization, and thus unacceptable for the crypto crowd. There are interesting ideas being tested instead, but the way communities are doing it highlights the privilege of the people working on decentralized projects. Today, pay revolves around a set of key questions. Should salaries be market-based? Role-based? Value-based? Employment-based? Ethics-based? Are they guaranteed? Localized? Negotiable? Secret or transparent? Singular, variable, tiered? Annually adjusted? market-adjusted? Are raises possible? If so, should they be tenure or experience-driven? Linked to performance? Inflation? DAOs fail to answer most of these questions.

DAOs today are composed of two classes of people: Core Contributors and Edge Contributors. The former are employees of sort, and earn a stable base pay from the organization. The latter are attracted to the organization’s mission, and volunteer their skills to perform tasks. They will usually expect a reward for their work. But the money set aside for salaries and rewards is not infinite, and must be shared fairly between contributors. Many DAOs have turned to tools such as Coordinape to tackle this challenge. This solution allows organizations to create “circles” of contributors (the equivalent of teams). Each member of the circle is given points and allocates them to other members of the circle over a certain period. The higher the perceived “value” of the work done, the higher the number of points received, and the higher the financial reward. If that seems too easy, trust your instincts.

DAOs are automated to ensure no funny business happens after the votes are cast (hence the “Autonomous”). However, point allocation requires that one trusts there is no collusion between actors in the team before the vote. This is strange, given that one of web3’s key selling points is the “decentralization of trust”. In fact, a point system begets constant feedback and transparency to avoid resentment and communication breakdowns. An argument can be made that this helps contributors concentrate on more value-adding tasks; but that’s some Invisible Hand/Neo-Classical Economics bullsh*t.

In DAOs, decisions are reached by vote

Tokens given to DAO stakeholders for services rendered have 2 functions. They act as valuable shares which can be traded, and as ballots to make decisions within the organization. I just described the concept of a public company’s shares, but don’t tell the Web3 crowd; they get upset.

Proposals are usually made along the lines of “should we invest in G or J”, “should we build on blockchain B or E”, “should we let person Y participate”… A majority is generally needed for a proposal to pass. Those who own the most tokens have a louder voice, as DAOs tend to use a “1 token = 1 vote” system instead of a “1 man = 1 vote” one. In principle, this means people who own the most tokens stand a chance of losing more due to poor governance decisions, and are thus more engaged. In practice, I think this is just a way for founders to keep control.
