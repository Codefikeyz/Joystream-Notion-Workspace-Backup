# **What are the issues of DAOs**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are built on the idea of decentralized fund management. Participants are employed by the network for the network, and decisions are made using decentralized governance systems. By removing the system of delegated power and giving it to the stakeholders, DAOs mitigate fund managers’ and directors’ incentives to misappropriate funds.

For all their benefits, DAOs can be a regulatory nightmare. With no single entity capable of taking responsibility for the DAO’s decisions, enforcing the law becomes tedious and puts every investor at risk.

Immutability is a fundamental part of the blockchain, but it can make development updates and bug fixes much more challenging to implement. Decentralized governance systems already suffer from low voter participation issues, and the lower the number of participants voting such as the council members in Joystream, the more centralized the system becomes.

Most DAOs abide by the idea that “code is law.” Organizations running on decentralized governance is not a new idea, but until now, they all relied on trusted agents at some level or the other. DAOs remove the need for trust, instead, relying on the validity of the code deployed on the network.

The mathematical certainty and irrevocable nature of smart contracts may not require people to act in good faith, but not everyone can detect vulnerabilities in its code. No code is completely airtight against attacks, and with most people likely relying on external audits to make a decision, DAOs do run the risk of deploying faulty code due to participant ignorance.

The things DAOs prevent

However, DAOs remove single points of failure by democratizing and decentralizing decision-making processes, especially regarding financial management. Organizations with hierarchical structures employ individuals to control millions of dollars in funding. DAOs prevent one person from having this kind of influence, decentralizing fund management, governance, and innovation.

The DAO was an experiment that ended badly, and its consequences would have been sobering if the network hadn’t voted to revert itself. This solution wouldn’t have even been possible on a truly decentralized network, but with millions of dollars at stake, it can be hard to forego trust in favor of computer code that may or may not be secure.

DAOs conceptually remove a lot of human aspects from the running of a business but are ultimately built, coded, and deployed by humans. Code is imperfect, and there will always be parties looking to undermine it for financial gain, so there will always be hesitation in trusting the entire operations of the entity to code

Limiting the scope of a DAO to certain types of decisions and ensuring participation could enable a broader community of token holders to meaningfully contribute. However, while this will be key to the future of successful DAOs, it will not create a truly autonomous entity — just one that handles some of the decision making.

There are many issues with a decentralized organization, especially in the realm of governance. If voting is weighted, the largest address holds the most power. If it is calculated on a per-address basis, then the largest address can break up their holdings across a number of addresses to achieve the same goal.
