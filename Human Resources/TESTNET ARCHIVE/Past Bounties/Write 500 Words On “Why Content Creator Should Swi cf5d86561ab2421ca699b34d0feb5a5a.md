Recency bias will always get marketers on their marketer-megaphones telling us that we have to do the new thing at-speed (the same ones that cried “books are dead!”), but right now, we could name just as many photographers that have reached their own defined idea of success without leaning into pleasing the algorithm, as those that have. We could name as many that have leant full into their ambiguous, risky artistry, and said no to the algorithm and trending techniques, as those that have. And that alignment shows it’s head in the work and in the depth of connections — every time.
