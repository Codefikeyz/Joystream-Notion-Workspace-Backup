**5 idea suggestions for the forum**

**1. Library:** A library that will be created for crypto communities will help to gather scattered information together. We know that everyone has a little bit of information about everything and that they get this information piece by piece from different sources. In case of a library, it allows us to create a much more compact and accurate source of information for both Joystream DAO and other crypto markets. Maybe there will come a day when everyone will benefit from this library.

**2. Dictionary**: crypto communities encounter a new term every day. New words are entering our lives. Even if it's a dictionary, wouldn't it be nice if we don't Google what it means for hours?

**3. Quiz:** Many people write important and beautiful individuals on the forum, but most people do them for task completion. I think it would be nice if we read these and do a quiz on them and give a nice gift to the successful ones! What do you think ?

**4. Award:** What if those who are active in the Forum and Discord and those who work the most are given an incentive rosette?

**5. Language:** There are **English and Russian** language options in the forum settings-language tab. It wouldn't be bad if other languages were added, at least a few more.
