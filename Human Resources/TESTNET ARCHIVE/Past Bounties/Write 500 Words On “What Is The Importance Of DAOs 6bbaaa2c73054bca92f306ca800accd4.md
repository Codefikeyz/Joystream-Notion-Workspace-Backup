# **Importance of DAO’s**

The foremost highlight of the importance of DAO focuses on decentralization, an essential trait of decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs focus on achieving the maximum extent of decentralization according to their basic design principles. The concept of complete decentralization generally loses value in other endeavors. However, the equation changes in the case of DAOs which rely on collective participation rather than depending on one individual.

The new focus on decentralization helped in preventing centralized control in a small group with vested interests. Such an approach also helped in preventing manipulation alongside opening up the doors for real-time actions. Not only that :

· DAOs can help in building new markets which can set their own standards for pricing and quality. In the broader crypto ecosystem, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are one of the integral highlights of the emerging web3 landscape with many promising value benefits. Starting from decentralization advantages to an autonomous structure, DAOs provide new definitions for an organization’s structure.Not only that DAOs enable collective management with the implementation of governance tokens. Governance tokens are utility tokens that provide their owners with the ability to participate in the decision-making and management of a DAO’s

· Economy: DAO is often considered as a decentralized governance structure. With its help, you can get rid of the managerial staff through system automation. As a result, project organizers will be able to save on salaries.

· High speed of work due to system automation: In DAO, there is no need to wait for the secretary to process the application and find the information of interest for the operation.

· Low percentage of errors due to the absence of the human factor: CAD users do not have to worry about a distracted manager mishandling the operation.

· Availability. Becoming a DAO member is easier than getting a seat on the board of a traditional organization.The transfer of control of the organization and its assets to the project participants is also seen by many as a benefit that ensures that the DAO’s founders do not abscond with investor money to tropical islands.

· DAO helps to “hear” everyone’s opinion. The full automation of blockchain systems allows at the same time to vote with demonstrable honesty and to execute the decisions of the members of the organization.

· Easy access / Availability: A wide variety of projects can operate in DAO format: from lending platforms to platforms whose goal is to raise money to fund promising startups. Some examples of decentralized DAOs include: Joystream and Uniswap crypto exchange.

· DAOs are controlled by means of the organization’s management tokens, which are distributed among its participants.As a rule, decisions about the development of a decentralized autonomous organization are made by vote, in which each piece = vote. And as a result cheating and swindle can’t be made possible.

· Security :The smartcontract technology which is the backbone of DAO’s allows to automate calculations and other operations in the corporate structure, as well as to transfer information for later storage on the blockchain .Thus all transactions are secure and well protected.

· Neutrality:Most of the troubles and conflicts in modern organizations emerge from regular discrepancies against an established set of rules. The overview of the importance of DAO would obviously focus on the neutral environment it creates for an organization. Without any intermediaries or managers holding significant authority in DAOs, you don’t have to deal with power plays and conflicts.
