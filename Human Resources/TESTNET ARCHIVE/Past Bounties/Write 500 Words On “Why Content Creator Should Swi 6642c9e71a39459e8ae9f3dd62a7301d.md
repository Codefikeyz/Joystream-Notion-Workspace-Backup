# **Why Content Creator Should Switch To Atlas?**

The idea of this article came to my mind when I thought about what competitors does the world’s largest video hosting platform called YouTube have? After all, in today’s dynamically developing world, competition exists for everyone, because it is the engine of progress, something that allows you not to stand still, but to create new ideas and new technologies.

And I found the answer for myself not in the past and in the present, I found it in the future, in an era when all online content will move to a new model — web 3.0, where everything will be decentralized, because it uses blockchain technology, where you will be the owner of the content that you post online. No one will be able to remove your information (posts, videos, content) from the sites, it remains forever in the network of blocks.

YouTube has a lot of cons and a lot of enemies that it has made over the years of its monopoly, let’s start with them.

# **Disadvantages due to which YouTube will soon be replaced**

1. Constant and annoying ads, which the platform shows more and more often, makes ordinary users less and less likely to visit this site.
2. All your work, videos, design, branding, subscribers, promotion, etc. are blocked and deleted with a single movement of the moderator’s hand or by the system itself automatically, often without the right to correct anything, and also often without announcing a clear reason.
3. The complexity of working with their internal video editing tools, you have to resort to third-party resources.
4. Very long loading and rendering of video for the author, which sometimes takes tens of hours.
5. Constant monetization of the platform functions, soon the free use of the platform will become a thing of the past.
6. The constant decrease in earnings for authors, as well as the tightening of rules for creating content.

Perhaps this is the main, infernal six minuses of YouTube, in view of which users and content authors are already looking for alternative sites that are freer and friendlier.

# **Why everyone will switch to Atlas**

And the main alternative to YouTube, the one that will replace it in web 3.0, the Atlas site from Joystream, will be discussed today.

Atlas — is a video platform that brings new and exciting monetization opportunities for users and especially for content creators.

At the moment, you can monetize your experience in two ways:

# **Video NFT**

You can sell your video as an NFT on the basis of an auction, or for a fixed amount, thereby receiving not only a decent reward, but also decorating someone’s private collection with your creation.

# **Creator tokens**

Yes, any content author can issue their own tokens, which they can subsequently distribute to their approximate audience and evaluate the quality of their work in terms of the price that users are willing to pay in order to receive even more quality content from their favorite author in the future.

And as you may have guessed, the Atlas platform from Joystream does not have all the disadvantages that we described earlier and will be a comfortable tool for spreading creativity and finding an audience.
