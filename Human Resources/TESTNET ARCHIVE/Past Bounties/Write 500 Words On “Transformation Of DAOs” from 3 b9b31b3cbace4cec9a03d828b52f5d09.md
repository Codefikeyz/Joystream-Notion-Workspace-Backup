# **Transformation of DAOs**

DAOs are often described as “group chats with a wallet,” but that’s something of an understatement: DAO treasuries across all networks currently hold over $10 billion in total, according to DAO analytics tracker DeepDAO. DAOs like Joystream also need adequate funding inorder to yield results.

The new organizational structure that DAOs represent is better thought of in the wider context of crypto. Just as cryptocurrencies seek to replace fiat currencies or traditional asset classes like gold, DAOs offer an alternative to traditional business structures.

DAOs are strictly online with no physical HQ, operate on a flat management structure (meaning no c-level executives) and are “token-aligned,” meaning members propose and vote on governance decisions according to their token holdings. In Joystream , various communication means exist on joystream telgram, joystream discord server and even joystream twitter.Some DAOs automatically enforce decisions, while others take it as a binding decision on the core contributors or paid team members to execute those decisions. DAOs were only a theoretical consideration, a potential use-case, in Vitalik Buterin’ sEthereum whitepaper in 2014. Since then, but especially over the past year, DAOs have become one of the hottest emerging spaces in crypto.

There are all sorts of DAOs, and they all have wildly different origin stories and purposes.

In March 2021, a group of 54 strangers who met each other in a Discord server set up BeetsDAO and raised 300 ETH (more than $500,000 at the time) to buy EulerBeats NFTs in an auction on OpenSea. They’re still going strong as an art investor DAO. Similarly, PleasrDAO, originally formed to buy digital artist pplpleasr’s Uniswap ad NFT, has now morphed into an all-around investor DAO, purchasing everything from Edward Snowden’s first NFT to the only extant copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s album “Once Upon A Time in Shaolin”.Most recently, DAOs have gone beyond buying digital art or setting up online projects, to address wider global concerns. UkraineDAO, set up by members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot and others, has raised $1.7 million towards humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, as the country battles the Russian invasion.

U.S. domestic politics is slowly entering the world of DAOs, too. Andrew Yang, a former candidate for U.S. president and New York City mayor, set up the Lobby3 DAO so that “people can see the benefit of these technologies” in the real world.

DAOs, Yang told Decrypt’s gm podcast, “could be a feature of a 21st century democracy… liquid democracy where people are assigning their voting rights on certain issues to other people who might have more expertise or more time.” It could, he argued, present an alternative to “floundering” democratic institutions that are “not truly representative.”But DAOs depend on more than just ambitious and energetic people initiating them and contributing to their success. There’s also technical infrastructure to consider — but the DAO toolbox remains perplexing to newbies, and especially to those without crypto expertise.

As a consequence, even those with decades of experience in coordinating teams can struggle to get a foot in the world of DAOs, if they lack the technical aptitude necessary to set up and maintain one.

That’s where DAODAO comes in. It claims its tools can help onboard those who want to create a DAO in a matter of minutes, opening the door to DAOs going truly mainstream.Essentially people can contribute to a DAO and they put funding in and they get coins, and we use an offshore entity that sits in between the contributor and the creator of the DAO,” he told Decrypt. “The entity protects the creator of DAO while also making sure they stay true to their mission.”

This means two things, Al-Naji said: first, it’s highly unlikely that the coins that you’re buying would be considered securities under the US law. It also protects the creator from any direct liability to the DAO token holders by having that entity in between.

He said DAODAO is working with a lawyer to craft a memo, and more details will follow closer to DAODAO’s public launch date of May 2022.
