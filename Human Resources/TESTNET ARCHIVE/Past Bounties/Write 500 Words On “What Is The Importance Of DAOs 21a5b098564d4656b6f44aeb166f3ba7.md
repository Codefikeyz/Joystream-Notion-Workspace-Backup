Write 500 words on “What is the importance of DAOs?”

The term DAO gives out a lot about the reasons for which it came into existence. You have “decentralized” and “autonomous” as the clarity that is the main principles. DAOs are not affiliated with any country to ensure complete decentralization. Basically, the developers of the first DAO aimed at shifting the decision-making power towards the members of the organization with a crowdsourced pool of funds.

DAOs don’t allocate control of a business or entity to one individual or group. On the contrary, the control of the business is vested in the group of supporters or members of the organization. In addition, the DAO benefits have also made a mark by introducing tokens, which serve as vital tools for voting on different improvement and protocol proposals.

JoyStream fully complies with this principle. The entire Joystream community is completely independent and decentralized and located in completely different countries.

The foremost highlight of the advantages of DAO focuses on decentralization, an essential trait of decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs focus on achieving the maximum extent of decentralization according to their basic principles.

In the case of a traditional publicly-traded company, the CEO and the board of directors have the final say in decision-making and other initiatives by the company. As a result, employees, users, and customers don’t come into the picture when thinking about the future direction of an organization.

Another significant answer for “What is the importance of DAOs?” would refer to the scope for community involvement. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs introduce the facility for communities all over the world to connect with each other and work on productive goals together.

Speaking of community involvement, you can round up on another notable mention among DAO with the active stake of each member. The mechanisms underlying DAOs primarily focus on the idea of allowing members to exert their stake in the organization. First of all, DAO governance tokens imply the necessity for burning or spending the tokens to earn voting rights. Therefore, members are more likely to be considerate and thoughtful of every vote. In other words, governance tokens on DAOs introduce the ability for all users to influence the future of the DAO project.

DAO offers users a chance to directly participate in the services they use and automate the process by which organizations change and adapt to users’ needs.

Consequently, DAOs remain user-centered while providing more autonomy and power to their contributors. Thus, as Web3 values shape new developments and services, we will likely see more internet-based companies emerge as DAOs on the blockchain.

The Joystream community is its driving force, which determines the further vector of its development. Thanks to the principles of DAO operation, all decisions in Joystream are made regardless of the preferences of its individual users. These are considered decisions that are supported by the majority of the community. The creativity that is distributed on the Joystream platform is a completely free and independent product, this is exactly what is practically absent in classic video streaming services.
