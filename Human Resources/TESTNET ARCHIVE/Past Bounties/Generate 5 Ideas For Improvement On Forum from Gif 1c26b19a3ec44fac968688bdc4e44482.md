Currently Joystream has a limited number of videos and has seen slow expansion, it would appear that many more videos are now being posted and with the consideration to actively market Joystream through Online Blogs we can expect that many more users will soon join.

Re-organizing the forum

My proposal (I cannot  implement this, but can present the strategy) is additional functions to the Web front end of Joystream for users and channel owners, whereby channel owners can be warned/blocked/have videos deleted and be notified of such.

Increase budget

Curators have an Admin page/login to [play.joystream.org](http://play.joystream.org/) whereby when viewing videos they would have UI buttons to Warn (with ability to describe reasons why), Delete and Block Video content. It would also be quicker for Curators (and provide better function for the Video Channel owner/content creator) if the action of Warn, Block, Delete sent a notification to them perhaps as a message to them within the forum and to their registered email account.

Better administration
