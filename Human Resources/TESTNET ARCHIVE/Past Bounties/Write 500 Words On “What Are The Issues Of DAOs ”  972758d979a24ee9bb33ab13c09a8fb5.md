# **What Are The Issues Of DAOs**

DAOs were originally proposed as some kind of utopia, similar to the idea of communism, where the society / community will have real rights, opportunities and power. The structure of many DAOs was inspired by Greek and Roman democracies, where everyone is equal and important, and the voice of each member of the DAO is important.But are the DAOs really the organizations they pretend to be now? In my opinion, obviously not. Let's try to figure out why this happens.

The first reason is that **many cryptocurrency projects** **masquerade as DAOs** for one reason or another:* legal - structured as a DAO may be more convenient for possible future regulation* to avoid the stigma of a "centralized" project* simply because DAO is a trend and fashionable, and you want to be on the same wavelength with everyoneNaturally, such fake decentralization is a problem with today's DAOs, since in fact most of these projects are centralized.Why is this happening? And that's the next problem. In my opinion, **the founders of the DAO do not trust their community** **too much**, focusing on making the DAO a beautiful wrapper, although there are precedents. For example, I participated in the Hopr pre-DAO, where the community was allowed to choose the sale price of the token and the type of sale (nonsense!).

The reason why startups don't put 100% of the real power in the hands of the DAO is that **the community itself is not ready to bear such responsibility**. And this is also one of the main problems of any modern DAO. In order for true decentralization to exist in the DAO, it is important that the community truly “sick” and live for this project, perceive it as their family. Social activity is also important. I was a member of one of the DAOs, close to the ideas of true fair launch decentralization (Inverse Finance was launched without VC, they recruited the most interested people and organized a community out of them, only 409 people), and so, in it really impact was brought by 10-20 people, the rest they just voted.

Unfortunately, **the community currently lacks motivation, technical skills, and possibly experience in the DAO routine**.

**Have a look at promising Joystream DAO====> [https://joystream.org.](https://joystream.org./)** I consider this project can be one of the benchmarks of decentralized system. Let’s be honest, a lot of DAOs now are not really DAOs in the literal sense. Not everything is allowed to DAO participants — they only have a certain area that they can influence (for example, such DAOs include the leading DeFi / lending protocols). Unfortunately, now the word DAO is very fashionable and there are some projects that devalue this word, its true meaning, hiding behind a screen and manipulating the community like puppets.

But this is normal. The DAOs are in their infancy right now and this new type of crypto organization still has a long evolution to go) I think a lot of cryptoenthusiasts are very excited where this road will take us…
