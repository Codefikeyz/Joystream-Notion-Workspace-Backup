**TRANSFORMATION OF DAOs**

DAOs’ network structure perfectly complements Web3’s basis, igniting a new creative market and the future of employment.

If we view decentralization as one of the critical characteristics of the future internet, DAOs can already be considered Web3. DeFi, for example, leverages Decentralized Autonomous Organizations to enable networks to become truly decentralized. DAOs play an important role in Web3.0, as seen by decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap.

NFTs, (DAOs), and the metaverse are all products of Web3, and they may all be grouped together. They share a number of characteristics, including user autonomy and ownership of assets through the usage of cryptocurrencies, community governance, and innovative funding methods that do not require the involvement of conventional venture capitalists.DAOs started out as a simple concept envisioned as organizations, created by an idea and fueled by developers, that automate business functions and processes by leveraging smart contracts and all the fundamental tenets of blockchain. The core idea was to flatten the complex business process that various organizations are mired in and facilitate movement of assets to a very future-oriented digital interaction that needed no intermediaries — promising faster, cheaper and more transparent transaction processing.

By replacing many intermediaries, the DAOs themselves acted as digital intermediaries that provide transparency and scale, giving them the stature of an organization without the traditional organizational constructs of entities, groups, management, charters and other forms of collective action. While the traditional centralized organizational structure is being challenged, the key organizational elements that remain are fueling a new economic revolution that is giving birth to a new creator economy and bringing artists, lawyers, developers and creators together from all around the globe to create ideas and monetize them at global scale in permissionless crypto economic systems built upon blockchain and Web3 technologies — and essentially defining the future of work.

DAOs can be leveraged for collective ownership, treasuries built off of the profits and put into a community chest which is then opened or used when there is a fair vote. Each member of the DAO is given voting authority and power. DAOs has done a great job of equaling the playing field by allowing users to share the cost of ownership of individual NFTs.

DAOs like **joystream** provide governance for web3 which boosts participation and reduces the risk of corruption or censorship, they allow for instantaneous decision-making once all members are in agreement and this speeds up the process of many situations, no more bureaucracy, no more tricks, no more red tape. Issues get solved quickly and fairly. As it stands, charitable organizations are the most benefitted by DAOs and this is also good as some charities have been embroiled in scandals as to where the money from donations has gone.

The world will eventually change as we know it with web3 and as DAOs grow so can the way the world handles business and cooperation. This generation is witness to a new way of thinking, of working, of living and with NFTs and DAOs that future could very well be one that is more just and transparent.
