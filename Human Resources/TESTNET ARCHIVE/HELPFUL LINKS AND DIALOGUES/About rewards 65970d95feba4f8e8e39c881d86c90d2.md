**What do you need to know about rewards?**
There are two types of rewards (You get two types of rewards at once. You earn tJOY, which are displayed in the pioneer and at the same time you are rewarded mainnet JOY in CRM):
**Main rewards in mainnet JOY**
- tJOY. This is a testnet token, you can get it by being in a workgroup or by completing a bounty. 
- JOY. The main token of the upcoming mainnet (launch of the main network). These tokens are distributed as part of the [**Founding Member program**](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/founding-member-program) (a program to reward valuable community members, abbreviated as [**FM**](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/founding-member-program)).

How to get JOY?
If you are a member of a working group or receive tokens for completing a bounty, then you will simultaneously have main network tokens for the calculation period.
How much you earned can be found here - [https://joystream.retool.com/embedded/public/9478bcc0-f6d6-4f74-bd0a-0637535e75b1](https://joystream.retool.com/embedded/public/9478bcc0-f6d6-4f74-bd0a-0637535e75b1)

What is the ratio of tokens?
For the last several periods we have a constant rate - 1 mln tJOY=$4650 in mainnet JOY.
This means that for every 1 mln tJOY earned, you will be awarded $4650 in [CRM](https://joystream.retool.com/embedded/public/9478bcc0-f6d6-4f74-bd0a-0637535e75b1).

Important! You can dispose of the test network tokens immediately after accrual (send for staking), and you can dispose of $JOY after the launch of the main network, provided that you have received the [**FM**](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/founding-member-program) status (to get FM status, you need to earn $10,000 in mainnet JOY).
