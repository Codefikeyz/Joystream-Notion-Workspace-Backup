From the pre-proposal discussion shown above,

The DAO should be aware of these tools:

- [jscan.io](https://jscan.io/) by
    
    [***@chaos77***](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members)
    
- [joystreamstats.live](https://joystreamstats.live/) [by](https://joystreamstats.live/)  and

- [Joystream Utils](https://joyutils.org/) by
    
    [***@klaudiusz***](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#members)
    
    ### Another activity that is good for community engagement. The DAO would be of benefit since the community will be aware of these tools that can be utilized in the governance and everyday operations of the organization.
