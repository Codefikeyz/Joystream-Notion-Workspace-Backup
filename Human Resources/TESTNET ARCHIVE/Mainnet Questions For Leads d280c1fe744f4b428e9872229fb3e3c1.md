# Mainnet Questions For Leads

### Write step by step guide how the work within your WG will be organized in the first term of the mainent

- Council will make a proposal for hiring a Lead
- Lead will be hired
- Lead will hire a first worker(s)
- Lead and the first worker(s) must be given access to Retool CRM
    - Martin has access to this function
- Start working (Assistance in recruiting the first workers in groups)

### Review [Gitbook Scores](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score) for your Work Group and tell:

- Which scores should be excluded?
    - Bounty-related scores
- Which scores should be added?
    - RESPONSE_TIME_SCORE - I would include in this score a timely response not only in the start-here channel, but also in the welcome channel (Perhaps there is an error in the gitbook, since it is the welcome channel that is being checked now)
- If you have scores that purely depend on the JSG decision, how can these scores be adjusted so the Council will be able to assess them in a more objective way?
    - None

### For each position of your WG in the mainnet, incl. the Lead:

- Develop the Job Descriptions and provide links to them.
    - Lead - [Lead responsibilities](HR%20Lead/Lead%20responsibilities%20531916b24ded47b9bf0440441906aa4d.md) (Excluding bounty work)
    - Workers - [Guide for new integrators](Guide%20for%20new%20integrators%20503a46c662f04910be1c153074632d00.md)
- Propose a stake amount in USD (and JOY) required by application for each position.
    - Lead - $10000 (166666 JOY)
    - Worker - $3000 (50000 JOY)
- Estimated salaries:
Based on this document  - [https://gist.github.com/bedeho/1b231111596e25b215bc66f0bd0e7ccc](https://gist.github.com/bedeho/1b231111596e25b215bc66f0bd0e7ccc)  the group will be allocated $2000:
Lead - $1200
Worker - $800
Or
Lead - $900
Worker - $550
Worker - $550

### If there will be less seats in the WG compared to the number of seats in the current testnet, which people will you hire? Propose your criteria.

The most active workers of the group for the testnet.

### How would you manage people who didn’t find their place in your WG, but who are still quite experienced?

Perhaps they would have been in reserve. Also in mainnet they can do some bounty missions.

### Propose a forecast of *capacity* utilization for your WG over time (in terms of capacity required over time/ staff number required over time/ overall budget required over time). For example, for the Storage WG *capacity* will be the total storage space avaliable across all servers.

At the start 1-2 workers.

Further the size of the group will increase by the number of users in the chats.
