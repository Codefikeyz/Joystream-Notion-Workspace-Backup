## Let's start with the main tasks of the group:

- **Greeting**
Between 6am and 11pm CET.
All new persons should be greeted by a member in the HR working group in the `#welcome` or `#general` channels, offered assistance in solving CAPTCHAs if needed (#verification channel).
It's important to do it in less than 2 minutes! This affects the group's grade.
- **Onboarding**
Get new persons setup with a first membership and added to the CRM.
As soon as possible after being greeted, the objective of the HR worker is to do the following in the given order
1. Capture the person in the CRM, so that they can be catalyzed later and the project captures relevant up to date information about who is arriving, and from where,
2. Get the person to create a membership on-chain, with accurate referral information and metadata, and also some initial $tJOY to get started using the chain.
3. Get the person into a specific activity, aligned with their skills and interests, and with the needs of the network, allowing them to earn $tJOY and $JOY. This is first achieved by developing an understanding of the person in terms of skills and interests, and the filtering the set of near term opportunities through this profile. The major opportunities are
    1. Starting to work on an existing bounty, from the bounty template in the CRM, or assist them in creating a custom bounty (a new bounty specifically based on this persons skills and interests).
    2. Getting a role in a working group where there is soon space for newcomers.
    3. Running as a candidate for the council.
This onboarding should always be initiated right after the initial greeting stage, however, it may also be attempted as part of a catalyzing effort for a dormant person who never graduated into a substantive activity. The outcome of an attempt should be recorded in the CRM.
- **Catalyzing**
Get persons started with a concrete activity, such as creating a bounty, working on an existing bounty or applying for a role.
Invariably, people will drop off at various level of progression before becoming founding members. Some may never even get started beyond setting up a membership. This could be for a variety of reasons. Since we are recording all interactions in the CRM, we have visibility into the history of correspondences between the HR group and a given person, and we can see the history of activities they have been involved in. This allows the HR group to check in with people as they stall and *catalyze* them to continue their journey, as well as capture valuable information about why they stalled.
- **Nurture:**
To engage and re-engage existing persons in the CRM who are not yet founding members, to encourage them to continue, help them get answers to questions, and gather insights about their experience to support the overall success of the founding member program.

## The next part of the task is to work with the CRM system

- **Person logging**
Every new user who wrote in the #start-here channel must be added to the CRM. (You do not need to add users who have written "Hi" and requested test tokens. Only users who make contact should be added. Even if they have created a membership)
In order for you to add him to CRM, it is important that he create his membership here - [https://dao.joystream.org/#/profile/memberships](https://dao.joystream.org/#/profile/memberships) .
To find out a newcomer's membership, we put him in the #faucet channel.
- **Interaction Logging**
Every useful interaction with a user should be added to the CRM. 
The interaction must be with a result. For example: created a bounty for a user, helped create a membership, helped get into a workgroup.

## Starting work

1. First you have to do on-chain verification. It is necessary for the convenience of communication. After verification you will have the role of HR worker.
    
    [Guide How to complete on-chain verification  ⬅](Guide%20for%20new%20integrators/Guide%20How%20to%20complete%20on-chain%20verification%20%E2%AC%85%20d5cea53747f64023a6fa87f2c93c0f71.md)
    
    Video guide on how to do it - [https://www.loom.com/share/8bcd6358ca61427ca6caba3cc41d3259](https://www.loom.com/share/8bcd6358ca61427ca6caba3cc41d3259)
    You need to do it in the general channel
    
    ![Untitled](Guide%20for%20new%20integrators/Untitled.png)
    
    If you have any questions, write to adovrn 
    
2. Then comes the test period of 1 week. This is to see if you are able to work as an integrator. This is done due to the fact that there is a limit of 8 integrators in the group. The leader needs to understand that you are suitable for this role.
    
    You need to chat with newbies, do main tasks, which are described [**here**](Guide%20for%20new%20integrators%20503a46c662f04910be1c153074632d00.md)
    
3. Then you need to be added to the CRM as integrator. This is so that you have access to different dashboards and forms.
To do this, you need to send a message to the HR group leader in the format:
member handle - [member handle]
discrod - [discrod]
email - [email]

Then you have to wait until you receive an invitation. You do not need to register your Retool account without an invitation.
4. Once you have access to the CRM system you need to mark in the form that you are online

You need to switch from offline to online status and click Update Status.
This should be done every time you get to work. When you are available and ready to answer questions from newcomers.
When you are finished working, you need to switch your status to offline.

To get the nickname, you need to carefully clarify it in the chat room. For example: Have you already created a membership? Or find the nickname in the faucet channel.

## Salary information

6 tJOY/block (604800 tJOY/week) - minimum salary. Anyone who greets users in welcome and helps in chats gets it.

12 tJOY/block (1209600 tJOY/week) - the salary of an integrator who works with CRM.
I will set you this salary when I see the interaction you added and the new user added to the CRM.
I see added interactions here - [https://airtable.com/shrlwD1K5PAzpHWpv/tblD3YcXknIiJrQaL](https://airtable.com/shrlwD1K5PAzpHWpv/tblD3YcXknIiJrQaL)
But the group leader can't see who is adding new users to the CRM, so you need to text the group leader when you do this. That way the leader will raise your salary faster.
