**CHATTING FRAMEWORK**

1. Welcoming and asking them to get verified
2. Making sure they create membership and be sure Member Handle and ID are noted - can take advantage of this by asking for these before giving test token.
3. Asking about their skill and interest
4. Ask when and how did they find out about Joystream
5. Suggesting or leading them to possible ways on how to get involved
6. If no bounty fits them or no WG Opening, tell them that the will be contacted in the next few days or so for a personalized bounty for them.
7. Asking more additional information.
