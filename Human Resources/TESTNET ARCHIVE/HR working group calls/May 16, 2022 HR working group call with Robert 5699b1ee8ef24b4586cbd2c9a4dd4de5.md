**Meeting Call with JS Genesis and HR Working group**
Attendees: Robert (cmo) , José Umaña, eclipsingbinary, adovrn

**Recruiting**

- Robert explained to us that JS genesis is using other discords to market JoystreamDAO. It’s been successful and people are coming in. It’s being done using the DAO videos so people come in with some understanding.
- JSG wants to do more targeted advertising for specific types of candidates to recruit.
- We need to get new comers to work the sooner the better. The longer they are not working the less likely they are to become FMs
- Robert asked if we knew what types of candidates were needed at the moment to which the answer is we don’t know but are in the process of finding out. adovrn has asked every team lead directly for their recruiting needs and is compiling a table [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Vacant-Seats-in-groups-f9412d3da2974f96824e957ff74e98d5](../Vacant%20Seats%20in%20groups%20f9412d3da2974f96824e957ff74e98d5.md)
- Roberts suggests having a Job Description with the job openings and a link to send the people directly and give them a bounty. It gives legitimacy to the job.
- The call was short as we need to find out what candidate types are needed so that they can target their marketing accordingly
