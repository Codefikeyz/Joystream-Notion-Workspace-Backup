Apr 16, 2022 HR working group call with Ben

Attendees: @blrhc @adovrn @eclipsingbinary

Thanks to Ben for the call. He was very helpful but we all realized that things aren’t so obvious and it requires messing around with the forms in CRM and Pioneer to get a clearer understanding since it is not very clear or user friendly. **New users:** We went over the New User flow in the Discord

- New users arrive generally in both the **#Welcome** and **#start-here** channels and are asked to get verified in **#Verification** in Discord
- We discovered that a small percentage of those actually get verified in Discord and move on to either, **#introduce-yourself** or **#general.** Once here we send them to create a membership in [https://dao.joystream.org/](https://dao.joystream.org/)
- We understand we are to assess the abilities and interests of new members and direct them towards the proper link i.e Bounties, Gitbook, Discord chat, etc.

**Bounties**

1. Ben explained the Bounty Template Dashboard in [CRM](https://joystream.retool.com/apps/0539981c-8f35-11ec-9a0e-777f98991881/Joystream%20CRM%20Dashboards/Bounty%20Template%20Dashboard)
- These are templates that we can use/select from for creating a bounties
- There are internal bounties only visible to the Working Group separate from the ones in Pioneer.
- We can create the bounty both in CRM and Pioneer if we want to open the bounty to the community.
- It seems like the bounties come from WG budget and it generated questions of how it affects the workers pay
- We did not go over an example of creating a bounty in the CRM
1. Ben demonstrated a creation of a Bounty in Pioneer and we noticed the following

[https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/11](https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/11)

- Some terms and definitions in information bubbles during the creation were unclear. i.e “Cherry”, which generated questions of what value to add in that field.
- We noticed that the bounty could be assigned to a member during the creation process
- We also noticed that because it was assigned, only that person (in this case @adovrn) could sign for and contribute to the bounty
- At the end of the example, @adovrn contributed to the bounty but we could not see the contribution

We ended the call, and we understand that there are some issues with the bounties that need resolving and that it is not entirely clear for everyone. We are allowed / encouraged to play around with the modules in CRM and Pioneer to better understand how things work.

**Questions:**

1. Since there is a lot of figuring out to do and we have to just jump in and play with stuff in hopes of figuring things out. Can we create bounties for that?
2. We went over the bounty templates in CRM but did not run through an example of creating an actual bounty using the templates. Can a guide be created? Should this be one of those bounties of us trying to figure things out?
3. When will the first bounty from genesis be available?
4. How to competently put awards for bounties? (so important)
5. Do bounties have to be approved by the council?
6. When does a bounty become a proposal that requires a broader discussion?
7. Where does one propose ideas for CRM forms?
