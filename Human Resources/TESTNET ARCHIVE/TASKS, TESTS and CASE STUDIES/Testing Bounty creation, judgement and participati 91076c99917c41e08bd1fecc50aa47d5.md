This is what the description looks like after creating the bounty. The text is not created correctly. It may also be necessary to reduce the size of the image on the page

![Untitled](Testing%20Bounty%20creation,%20judgement%20and%20participati%2091076c99/Untitled%2014.png)

The page opens at the wrong scale. I have to zoom out of the page to get the button to appear.

After submitting the work, the text is also published incorrectly. (In the screenshot the text is different, the essence does not change)

**Lorem input instead of all the clues. In fact, there are no hints.** The problem is not even the translation. ****RU version ****

**Cherry. What is Cherry?** This may be confusing to new users. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound logical enough.
In both languages.

**Screenshots.** It might be convenient to attach images in description (screenshots or something like that) to some bounty.
This is more of a suggestion than a bug.
