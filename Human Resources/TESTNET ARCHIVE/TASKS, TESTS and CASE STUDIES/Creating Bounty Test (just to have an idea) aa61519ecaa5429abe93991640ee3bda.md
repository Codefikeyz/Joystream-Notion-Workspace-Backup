# Creating Bounty Test (just to have an idea)

Background: So today, I realized that we might need Chinese Speaker in our group. I remember 

one newcomer who wanted to be a moderator in #chinese. I contacted her, and told her the opportunity to be in HR WG. She was ready to do it, however, she doesn’t have enough tJoy to stake since she is a newcomer. I could have given her 25k tJoy but I felt like I want her to earn it. 😄  And since, we will be dealing a lot about bounties soon, I decided to give it a try.

Before this, I made sure that she/he has the ability to do the Bounty thru asking her about her interests and skill set.

1. I went to the governance site and go to Bounties.

    There you go, basic just fill out the blank fields. And, COVER PHOTO is a must - you need a link for that.

    Next is this, for funding. I set the target at 600,000. Me and leet_joy contributed half half.

It was actually wrong of me to put 100,00 for entrant stake, should have been much lower.

I didn’t actually intend to open a forum. :D But i did. 

Update: So now, the newcomer was able to announce that is doing the bounty submit his work.

Screenshots from the bounty participant.

On my end, this is what I see:

It is shown there that, there is already 1 submitted work. But I cannot open it yet since the Bounty is still in Working Period. Also below you can see the discussion thread, which is also in Forum, interesting! The bounty participant post his work there also. (I should have asked him to do it in Medium) ***Lesson: Be specific on how you want the final output be presented.***

Also noticed the ***“Announce Entry”*** button, I clicked it and it appears that I or anybody else can also participate in the bounty.

So I waited, I was expecting I will see the work submitted by 10pm-ish March 30. But it seems I cannot. So I went to bed. And to my surprise when I checked this morning I got these

![Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 09.20.45.png](Creating%20Bounty%20Test%20(just%20to%20have%20an%20idea)/Screen_Shot_2022-03-31_at_09.20.45.png)

Puzzling, cause I have been checking from time to time. And there’s another thing 

![Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 09.21.07.png](Creating%20Bounty%20Test%20(just%20to%20have%20an%20idea)/Screen_Shot_2022-03-31_at_09.21.07.png)

And here it says no work submitted yet.

![Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 09.33.34.png](Creating%20Bounty%20Test%20(just%20to%20have%20an%20idea)/Screen_Shot_2022-03-31_at_09.33.34.png)

I think I missed the “Judging period”, but it was always showing me that no works submitted yet whenever I checked it. Also, it would make sense if I will be notified every time it progresses, but I wasn’t.

In this case the bounty “FAILED”, I then clicked “Notify me about changes” - unresposive, nothing happens. So I clicked what’s next to it.

I’ve put 500,000 cherry, it won’t credited back I suppose. Only the contribution of 300,000 but..

Failure for some reasons.
