- **Which bounties failed during the judgement period because the oracle did not submit a valid judgement.**
There weren't any of those.
- **An overview of which bounty templates, and in general types of bounties, are the most and least sought after, and what types of bounty templates more options are needed.**
Our group needs bounty templates that we can create for newcomers as a test of their skills before accepting them into working groups
For example: "Timely greeting of newcomers in the welcome channel" for the HR group
- **Recommendations for "graduates" that should be considered for a role and a specific working group, or handed a spot the council.**
Recommendations for HR WG: sieemma, ahmad robert
Recommendations for Marketing WG: e9orov, mrnasrinasir
- **What template bounties should have their budgets adjusted, and why.**
I think we need to increase by at least 3-4 times the bounty rewards that are presented in the templates. Current rewards do not attract users
The current benchmark for bounty awards is 40000 tJOY per hour of work. Do you think this should be increased?
