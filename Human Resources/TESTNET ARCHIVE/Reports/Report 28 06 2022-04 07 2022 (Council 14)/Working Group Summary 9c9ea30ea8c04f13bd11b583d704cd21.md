## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

I think the HR group leader should have access to the function of adding new integrators to the CRM. This would speed up the learning process for new integrators.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

I suggested simplifying dynamic salaries - [https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/356](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/356)
But we can apply this formula to bonuses - max reward x GROUP_SCORE
Example
Let's take the max bonus - 10 tJOY/block
Builders Last Score - 0.717
10x0.717=7 bonus tJOY to lead salary
