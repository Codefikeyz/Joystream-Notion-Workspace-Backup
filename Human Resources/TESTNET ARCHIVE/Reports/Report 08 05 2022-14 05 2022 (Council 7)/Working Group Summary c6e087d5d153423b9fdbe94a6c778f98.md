- **A summary on how well the working group served it's intended purpose.
[Group Activity](Group%20Activity%20ba176d072ec34381b65485215ef3bfb2.md)**
- **Recommendations for what should be focused on in next council period in order to make group more effective.**
Perhaps someone on the consul team should keep an eye on how HR team members are adding new users to the CRM, adding interactions with them. Be stricter with this. We need someone to keep an eye on the group 🙂
- **Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built in to this working group, other working groups, the council or Jsgenesis' role, in order to increase overall effectiveness of the group or the project.**
In several previous periods, consuls were assigned to each working group. This increased the effectiveness of the groups. We need to bring that back, in my opinion.
