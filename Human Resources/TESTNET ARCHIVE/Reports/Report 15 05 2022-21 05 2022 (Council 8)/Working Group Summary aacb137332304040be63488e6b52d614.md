- **Recommendations for what should be focused on in next council period in order to make group more effective.**
Perhaps someone on the consul team should keep an eye on how HR team members are adding new users to the CRM, adding interactions with them. Be stricter with this. We need someone to keep an eye on the group 🙂
Hasn't changed.
- **Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built in to this working group, other working groups, the council or Jsgenesis' role, in order to increase overall effectiveness of the group or the project.**
In several previous periods, consuls were assigned to each working group. This increased the effectiveness of the groups. We need to bring that back, in my opinion.
It hasn't changed. I have not been approached by any of the consuls with this question.
    
    This is the second period in a row that I've seen reports not being submitted on time.
    Is there any way to move the reports from Saturday/Sunday to Monday?
    And it would be very convenient if the consul would publish the exact date of the deadline for submitting the reports at the end of the period. For example 2-3 days before the deadline.
