## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

I have some workers without access to the CRM. I requested to add them a few weeks ago. They need to be given Integrator status in Retool. I think the lead of the group should have access to this function.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

I think we should approve extra-work-hour rewards for each group.
