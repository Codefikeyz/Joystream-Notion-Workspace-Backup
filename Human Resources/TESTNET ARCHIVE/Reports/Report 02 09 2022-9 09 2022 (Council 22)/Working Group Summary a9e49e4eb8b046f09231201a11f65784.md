## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

I think the HR group leader should have access to the function of adding new integrators to the CRM. This would speed up the learning process for new integrators. That's the problem. New integrators are not added to the CRM

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

[**Persons Table for Integrators](https://joystream.retool.com/apps/2260240a-cc71-11ec-868d-8fd3e9a5f615/Joystream%20CRM%20Dashboards/All%20Persons%20View%20(for%20Integrators)) -** The table should be available for the counsils. It is necessary for the evaluation of the group.
