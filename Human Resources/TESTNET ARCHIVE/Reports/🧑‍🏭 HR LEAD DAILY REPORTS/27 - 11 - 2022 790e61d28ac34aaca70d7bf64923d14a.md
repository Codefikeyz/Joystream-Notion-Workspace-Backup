# 27 - 11 - 2022

• Current Worker in HR - Lead

• Unable to create openings yet for workers as Lead operates on windows and currently waiting on new CLI Version to be able to do this.

• Tried creating an opening via [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc.joystream.org:9944#/extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc.joystream.org:9944#/extrinsics) signing with lead bound account but not successful.

• Opting to manually hire workers to begin executing the task [https://gist.github.com/bwhm/2a8733fe35974d4cb90a34ab1916d2ca#hr](https://gist.github.com/bwhm/2a8733fe35974d4cb90a34ab1916d2ca#hr) as it is one that I have done before.

• Orientation to my workers will proceed on 28-11-2022

• Further updates will be dropped for Council.
