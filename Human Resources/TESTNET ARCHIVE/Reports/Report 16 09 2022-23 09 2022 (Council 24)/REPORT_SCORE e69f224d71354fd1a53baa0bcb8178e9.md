- **Which bounties failed during the judgement period because the oracle did not submit a valid judgement.**
[https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/648](https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/648) - The Bounty itself ran out before its time. I think it was because of a problem with QN, which was. Bounty was recreated.
- **An overview of which bounty templates, and in general types of bounties, are the most and least sought after, and what types of bounty templates more options are needed.**
Most requested: for Marketing group.
****Our group needs templates for newbies, which can be created after dialogue in the start-here channel as a test of skills before working in the WG.
New ideas for the bounty are always a good thing.

Recommendations for Marketing WG: maks, Katya, Maks2306, Yagami;
Recommendations for Distribution WG: F1rst.
