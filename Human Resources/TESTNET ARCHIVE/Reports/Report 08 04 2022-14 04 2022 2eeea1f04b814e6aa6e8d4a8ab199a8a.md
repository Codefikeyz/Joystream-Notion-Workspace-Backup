### Questions to Leads

**Does your group have all needed resources, access?**
*Yes. New workers in the process of being added*

**Which issues do you see that could lower the group score?**
*There is no understanding of what the real tJOY/JOY rate will be, so I am waiting for the CRM system to be updated to make sure I am paying enough to my employees.*

**Which issues need to be fixed for Bounties to be fully usable?**
*We expect to launch Bounty 2.0, bounty templates in crm system, first bounty from genesis.*

### Questions for counclis

The last time I saw that for a group of HR did a budget of 6 million a week
The group's expenses were 3.024 million a week.
Why does the group always have payroll debt?
