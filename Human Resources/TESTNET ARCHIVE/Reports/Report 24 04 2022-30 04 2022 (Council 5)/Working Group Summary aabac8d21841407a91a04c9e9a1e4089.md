- **Recommendations for what should be focused on in next council period in order to make group more effective.**
We need some way to influence that all members of the group will be added to the CRM system as integrators. Requests for some have been open for two weeks
- **Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built in to this working group, other working groups, the council or Jsgenesis' role, in order to increase overall effectiveness of the group or the project.**
Our group is required to respond instantly to newcomers in the welcome channel.
If I put people on the welcome channel on a clear schedule, people don't work long, they don't like it, and they leave the group.
Right now we are working without a clear schedule. Workers respond as they have time. With this scheme, workers stay in the group, but the response time increases.
Maybe we should make a bot that will instantly welcome newcomers ONLY in the welcome channel. The rest of the channels will be the same for workers.

Don't you think we need to do reports after the period is over? (For example: the deadline is the first day after the period ends.)

Positive status is missing from user statuses ([New Integrator Interaction Form](https://joystream.retool.com/apps/cfb34266-7f02-11ec-bcc9-bfca22ef4a34/Joystream%20CRM%20Forms/New%20Integrator%20Interaction%20Form))
