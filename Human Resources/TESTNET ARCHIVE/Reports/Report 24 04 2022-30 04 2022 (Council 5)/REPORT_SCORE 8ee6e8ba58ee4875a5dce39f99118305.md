- **What, and how many, bounties created by the group were completed during the council period, and for each bounty**

There weren't any in this period
- **An overview of which bounty templates, and in general types of bounties, are the most and least sought after, and what types of bounty templates more options are needed.**
Don't you think bounties like "Make a Video Tutorial "Vote for a Council Candidate", Make a Video Tutorial "Stand for Council", Make the Handbook "Stand for Council" Tutorial, Make the Handbook "Vote for a Council Candidate" Tutorial" are disposable bounties? Or can they be done an infinite number of times?
Bounties "Suggest Simple Bounties", "Do something creative with the Joystream logo (or branding)", "Find any interesting crypto news story and create a forum thread" are great for newbies.
- **Recommendations for "graduates" that should be considered for a role and a specific working group, or handed a spot the council.**
Recommendations for Builders WG: plutoniumApples#1590, `Leo#6141, JamesWee#2194, Salamander#0774
- **What template bounties should have their budgets adjusted, and why.**
I think we need to increase by at least 3-4 times the bounty rewards that are presented in the templates. Current rewards do not attract users
