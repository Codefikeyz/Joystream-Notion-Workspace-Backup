# Working Group Period Plan

- **Current group composition.**
adovrn, kriptos, eclipsingbinary, np900, sieemma, Umar, halk99, adams2002
- **Plan for hirings (emphasizing newcomers).**
1 worker can be hired.
- **Planned firings.**
1-2 workers can be fired if they do not show activity in the next period.
- **Onboarding plans for newcomers.**
Helping newcomers in the chat room decide on their place in the DAO (Creating a bounty, suggestions for working groups).
The plan is to hire a newcomer every period and fire the most inactive member.
First, I create a bounty for the newcomer with one of the group's tasks to test the newcomer's abilities. Then the newcomer is accepted into the group if they have successfully completed the task.
The team needs to add as many newcomers as possible to the CRM after a dialogue with them in the start-here channel.
- **Ranked list of suggestions for problems groups should attempt to tackle, and how, with corresponding budgeting, marketing or other resources needed from council or Jsgenesis.**
