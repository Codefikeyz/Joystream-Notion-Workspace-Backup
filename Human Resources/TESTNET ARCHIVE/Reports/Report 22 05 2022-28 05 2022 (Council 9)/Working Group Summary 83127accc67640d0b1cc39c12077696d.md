- **Recommendations for what should be focused on in next council period in order to make group more effective.**
The team needs to mark as many interactions as possible in CRM from the start-here channel.
Also with the addition of new users in the CRM.
- **Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built in to this working group, other working groups, the council or Jsgenesis' role, in order to increase overall effectiveness of the group or the project.**
In order to report the full performance of the group for the period, I need to do a report after the end of the period. Specifically: adding users to CRM, adding user interactions to CRM, complete information about the bounty, information about how much was spent on the bounty - all of this can change on the last day of the period.
