# REPORT_SCORE

- **How many new people reached out to the group in discord, and how many of them were captured in the CRM.**
During this period, ~26 newcomers contacted the group in the start-here channel.
There were a lot of developers in this period who were reluctant to make contact. We did not manage to get through to all of them. Some asked two questions and disappeared.
Also CRM did not work for several days. Thank you for understanding
13 users were added to the CRM (Duplicates: ohnrne#9515, Ömer_ÖzdemirTR#5183)

1204000 tJOY will be taken from the group's budget

- **Which bounties failed during the judgement period because the oracle did not submit a valid judgement.**
There weren't any of those.
- **An overview of which bounty templates, and in general types of bounties, are the most and least sought after, and what types of bounty templates more options are needed.**
Most requested: for HR and Marketing groups.
****Our group needs templates for newbies, which can be created after dialogue in the start-here channel as a test of skills before working in the WG.
New ideas for the bounty are always a good thing.
- **Recommendations for "graduates" that should be considered for a role and a specific working group, or handed a spot the council.**
Recommendations for HR WG: halk99
Recommendations for Marketing WG: Viktor_
Recommendations for Builders WG: Premium
- **What template bounties should have their budgets adjusted, and why.**
I think it's unfair that tasks for developers are graded the same as for marketing.
How about we make the following awards?
Marketing tasks - 75,000 tJOY/hour
Developer tasks - 150,000 tJOY/hour
