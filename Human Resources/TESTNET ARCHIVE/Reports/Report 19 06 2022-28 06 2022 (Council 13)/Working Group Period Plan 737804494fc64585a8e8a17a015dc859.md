Helping newcomers in the chat room decide on their place in the DAO (Creating a bounty, suggestions for working groups).
The plan is to hire a newcomer every period and fire the most inactive member.
First, I create a bounty for the newcomer with one of the group's tasks to test the newcomer's abilities. Then the newcomer is accepted into the group if they have successfully completed the task.
The team needs to add as many newcomers as possible to the CRM after a dialogue with them in the start-here channel.
The team needs to mark as many interactions as possible in CRM from the start-here channel.
