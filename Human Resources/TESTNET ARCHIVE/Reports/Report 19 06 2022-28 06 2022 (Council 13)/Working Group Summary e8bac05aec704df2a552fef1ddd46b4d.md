## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

I have some workers without access to the CRM. I requested to add them a few weeks ago. They need to be given Integrator status in Retool. I think the lead of the group should have access to this function. No change 🙂

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

I had an idea about how to reward content creators. We could create a bounty after the work has been done.
For example, someone in content group once a week collects data from participants who have uploaded a video and want to be rewarded for it. Then I create a bounty assignment for them where they submit their video links and then get rewards.
