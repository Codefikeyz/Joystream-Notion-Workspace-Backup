# DRAFT - FM Poker

## FM Poker Night Proposal

### Introduction

As a DAO, we value our community and the relationships we have built over time. As such, we want to create an activity for our old members that will allow them to reconnect, have fun, and create new memories together. We are excited to propose the idea of hosting an FM Poker Night.

### Description

FM Poker Night is a fun and engaging online event that will allow old members to socialize, have fun, and compete against each other through a friendly game of poker. The event will be hosted on an online platform, and attendees will be able to chat with each other while playing.

We believe that FM Poker Night would provide a unique opportunity for our members to connect with each other in a relaxed and enjoyable setting. It would be a great way to bring our community together and foster a sense of belonging among our Founding members.

### Agenda

The event will consist of three main parts:

1. Intro and welcoming in Discord
2. Poker game
3. Announcing of winners

The poker game will be the main event of the night. Attendees will compete against each other in a friendly game of poker, with the winner receiving some Joy.

After the poker game, we will move on to the social hour. This will be an opportunity for attendees to chat with each other and catch up on old times. We believe that this will be a great way for our members to reconnect and build new relationships.

### Logistics

We propose that the event be hosted on ClubGG Poker. This platform has been chosen because it is user-friendly, easy to access, and allows for easy communication between attendees.

The event will be held on Mondays 14 CET

The event will be open to all Founding members of the DAO. We believe that this will be a great opportunity for our community to come together and reconnect.

### Budget

The budget for FM Poker Night will depend on the number of attendees and the prize for the winner. We recommend that the budget be set at 10,000 Joy to cover the prize and any other expenses that may arise.

### Promotion

Promotion of the event will be done through Discord and Telegram (the official and for RU speaking)
