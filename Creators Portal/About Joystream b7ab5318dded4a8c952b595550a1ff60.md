Joystream is a video streaming protocol built on the proprietary blockchain and managed by the DAO. It is the underlying platform which powers Video Streaming Dapps, such as Gleev.xyz.

It does for video publishing what e-mail did for mail, and Bitcoin did for money. On Joystream, all profiles, videos and social interactions live on a dedicated high throughput public blockchain. 

A user-controlled DAO funds creators and builders, and operates the storage and content delivery infrastructure. Developers can therefore build new applications on an existing open network effect and infrastructure, with APIs they can trust forever, unlike the current closed incumbents. This empowers them to experiment with new features, algorithms and policies that can delight creators and consumers in new ways, unlike today, where everyone is stuck with a single experience controlled by one company. 

Creators can build their audience and business on a solid foundation. They can sell video NFTs to capture more value from their greatest fans. And they can also issue a dedicated revenue share creator token to finance their creative projects.
