# Term 25

## Term 25 plan

### 1. **Group composition**

| Worker ID | Member ID | Member handle | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 306 | `freakstatic` | developer, deputy |
| 11 | 4407 | `TheGrimSavage` | developer |
| 23 | 5715 | `ericTron` | developer |
| 26 | 7238 | `Magda` | designer |
| 29 | 4141 | `gyroflaw` | developer |
| 27 | 2233 | `klaudiusz` | developer |
| 30 | 3089 | `ivant` | QA tester |
| 31 | 2673 | `polikosi` | QA tester |
| 32 | 11141 | `GoldWolf` | developer |
| 33 | 37781 | `mkbeefcake` | developer |
| 34 | 2233 | `klaudiusz` | lead |
| 35 | 4404 | `thesan` | developer |
| 36 | 4133 | `mr_bovo` | developer |
| 37 | 4631 | `attemka` | developer |

Planned composition changes:

1. `thesan`, `mr_bovo` and `attemka` were hired this term. Their extensive experience coming from JSG should be a huge impact for BWG.
2. `klaudiusz` will be fired from regular worker position and only keep the lead worker position.
3. `Magda` is no longer working with BWG, will be fired.
4. `TheGrimSavage`, `ericTron`, `gyroflaw`, `polikosi`, `GoldWolf` and `mkbeefcake` will be fired following budget considerations. Some of the workers still have assigned and approved tasks from previous terms so they will continue that work and get paid for it upon completion, according to past council signals.

### 2. **Group budget**

**JOY/USDT EMA30: 0.046** USDT

| **Item** | **USDT** | **JOY** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lead salary | $2,243.2 | 48,765.21 JOY | Lead was hired at block 5,352,479. The lead salary was updated at block 5,370,599 (0.19→0.285 JOY/block). Blocks of old salary: 5,370,599 - 5,352,479 = 18,120 Blocks of new salary: 5,529,625 (expected term end) - 5,370,599 = 159,026 Term salary: 18,120*0.19 + 159,026*0.285 = 48,765.21 JOY |
| Regular salaries | $4,950 * 9/15 = $2,970 | 64,565.22 JOY | 3 developers with rate of $1650/term = $4,950
This is gonna be a rough estimate for this term since workers were hired mid-term, so it’s hard to estimate exact spending. |
| Hourly salaries | ~$1850 | ~40,217.39 JOY | This depends on the exact hours spent on work this term. Report will include the breakdown. |
| Total Spending | ~$7,063.2 | ~153,547.82 JOY |  |

### 3. **Group tasks**

1. Execute all the hiring/firings and group restructure.
2. Get new team members working on tasks right away.
3. Prepare final Nara testnet, including upgrade from Ephesus.
4. Create GitHub project to track current BWG work and progress.
5. Settle all past debts with workers.

Comments:

1. Most work of hourly workers (QA and deputy) in term 25 was already covered by the Council funding proposal - [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/710](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/710). $60 was paid to `ivant` - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5529264-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5529264-1)
2. $210 was paid to former worker `GoldWolf` for some work on curator tool, migration to new server and past server costs - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5412964-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5412964-1).

### 3. Group tasks

> Execute all the hiring/firings and group restructure.
> 

Done. Workers that have ongoing tasks from legacy system are still in the group.

> Get new team members working on tasks right away.
> 

Done. New workers were hired right after the new budget was approved and started working right away, see breakdown below.

> Prepare final Nara testnet, including upgrade from Ephesus.
> 

This term we’ve learned that Nara is still a bit away, dependant on Bedeho and JIPs. I’m trying to get more specifics here. So this hasn’t been that big of a priority, but we’re working on this with `freakstatic`, we’re also confirming everything works as expected when it comes to timings of the upgrade and impact on ongoing elections - [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5009](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5009)

> Create GitHub project to track current BWG work and progress.
> 

Done, it’s here - [https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/64/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/64/views/1). It’s not really organized yet and will need more work, but you can see what tasks we are working on and some short-term plans.

> Settle all past debts with workers.
> 

Done for all the finished work - [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/710](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/710). There are still some approved tasks that were not finished yet:

- validator module,
- thread/proposals labelling,
- opted-out accounts in elections.

### 4. Other

1. All the access from old lead and services from old workers were migrated:
    1. Discord role bot has been transferred to a new server and new access tokens were generated.
    2. Curator tool has been migrated to a new server. The code was also moved from private worker repo to Joystream org - [https://github.com/Joystream/curator-video-tool](https://github.com/Joystream/curator-video-tool). The tool is now available at [https://curator.joyutils.org](https://curator.joyutils.org/video-list).
    3. Council report tool has been moved to a repo in Joystream org - [https://github.com/Joystream/council-report-tool](https://github.com/Joystream/council-report-tool). Deployment at [https://report.joyutils.org/](https://report.joyutils.org/) is now also managed by me.
2. Work breakdown:
- `mr_bovo` has been (and is) working on investigation of timeout issues in storage nodes. We have a group with SWG lead and the work is constantly progressing.
- `attemka` has been also working on support for SWG, creating tool to find missing storage objects and compare with QN data - [https://github.com/Joystream/swg-files-comparer](https://github.com/Joystream/swg-files-comparer)
- `thesan` has been working on Pioneer. We are steadily progressing with reviews of validator module PRs and backlog of other PRs. He has also introduced basic support for mobile wallets so we can post on forum on the go - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4708](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4708) with other smaller improvements.
- `freakstatic` and `ivant` have been working on Nara QA and tests.
- `klaudiusz` has been working on all things above in the report, SWG/DWG support, bunch of reviews and other smaller things.
