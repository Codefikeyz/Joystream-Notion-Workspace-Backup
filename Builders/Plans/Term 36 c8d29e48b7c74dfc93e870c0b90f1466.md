| **Item** | **USDT** | **JOY** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lead salary | 7,425.24 | 928,155 | $10,000/mo * 0.933 = $9,330/term. With 1yr vesting applied. Subtracting some of the days off I took over the summer from this term salary: 26.07, 29.07, 02.08, 12.08. Assuming average working days per month is 21, 4/21*10,000=1,904.76. So after subtracting, this term salary is 9,330-1,904.76=7,425.24 |
| Deputy salary | up to 300 | up to 37,500 | Will be settled hourly, based on work. |
| mrbovo salary | up to 1,000 | up to 125,000 | Will be settled hourly, based on work. |

🟡 Unfortunately we did not launch to the public yet. We had delays on multiple fronts, including more fixes for the app, researching Uniswap AMM setup and discussions with the council. As of the term end, we’re waiting for the funds to arrive on Base so we can set up the AMM. At that point, we are ready to launch. We have also done work for the arbitrage strategy for Hummingbot, we’re currently reviewing and testing it.
