Comments:

1. The lead reward was first withdrawn to the lead reward account from the group budget - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6572042-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6572042-1).
Then 1yr vesting was applied to that same account - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6572091-2](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6572091-2).
2. I forgot to make the payment for Dapplooker before the term ended, they will be compensated in term 31.

### 3. Group tasks

> Help SWG&DWG fully roll out squid-based nodes.
> 

Done. All nodes have been upgraded.

> Continue work on Luxor runtime upgrade, prepare a document with a full scope.
> 

Done. The document was published on the forum - [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/876](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/876). Apart from that we have continued the work on runtime Luxor tasks and QN/Pioneer support for them.

> Continue Nara upgrade operations and ensure smooth upgrade 🤞.
> 

Done, no unexpected issues whatsover 🎉.

> Start R&D for Argo Ethereum bridge.
> 

Done. After more research it was decided that a community bridge isn’t the best direction for us and instead we’ve decided to prioritise development of the Sygma bridge. You can find more details in the Luxor doc linked above.

> Deliver WalletConnect support in Atlas.
> 

In progress. Unfortunately this is still blocked. There’s no pending work on BWG side, we’re just waiting for review from JSG.

> Find a solution to QN availability issues.
> 

In progress. No solution per se yet but we have made progress on improving the situation. We have researched ways to track QN usage and specific queries. We have also done work to introduce query timeouts to Hydra (QN framework) so we can block slow queries.
