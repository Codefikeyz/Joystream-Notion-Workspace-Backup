Comments:

1. The actual spending was lower because `attemka` finished his vacation during the term, so his salary was restored back only once he was back (22.01.24).
2. $700 was paid to `freakstatic` for his QA and deputy work - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5960828-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5960828-1).
3. $100 was paid to former worker `Create` for some work on Discord Role Bot - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5876008-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5876008-1).

### 3. Group tasks

> Continue SWG/DWG support with tooling/infra work as needed.
> 

Done:

- We have done more rounds of review and testing for Subsquid-based Argus&Colossus nodes and have merged those. We will work on deployment next term.
- We have done development and testing for the Storage Squid, which will power new versions of Argus&Colossus.
- We have worked with Subsquid team to fix an issue in their libraries.
- Storage Squid has now 2 public deployments (joystream.org, joyutils.org).
- Discussions with SWG and JSG on how to reduce our operating costs for storage - [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/811](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/forum/thread/811).
- We have worked on few minor improvements to Argus&Colossus.
- We have created a Github project to track progress of infra developments - [https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/70](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/70).

> Look for a designer that can work on WalletConnect designs and some small Pioneer issues.
> 

Done, we have interviewed 4 designers and asked one to work on the necessary changes. Main work was finished, only small fixes are pending. Payment for this will be processed next term.

> Develop changes to DWG ping tool so it can also monitor SWG servers.
> 

Done, both pings and Discord alerting was enabled for SWG.

> Prepare QA plan for validator module.
> 

Done, QA plan was created - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/4743](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/4743). We are currently testing the functionality.

### 4. Other

1. Nara work is going ahead full steam:
    1. We are proceeding with the final testnet upgrade QA. We have spinned up number of infrastructure to test it, the upgrade proposal is currently waiting for 2nd approval.
    2. We have created Nara release checklist describing in detail how the upgrade should proceed - [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5064](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5064).
    3. If everything goes smoothly, we expect to create mainnet runtime upgrade proposal next term.
2. We had a technical call with JSG to discuss future runtime upgrades. Conclusions:

> 
> 
> 1. We plan to do a next runtime upgrade 1-2 months after Nara, codenamed Luxor. This upgrade will include mostly minor items:
> - Substrate version upgrade (main point)
> - Ability for governance to adjust validator rewards, if not included in Nara
> - Extrinsic for vested spending from WG budgets
> - Support for nomination pools, pending confirmation that the Substrate version we're planning to upgrade to doesn't contain any critical issues with nomination pools pallet
> - Bedeho suggested possibly reducing council size in this upgrade, but that needs its own discussion within DAO
> 1. Next runtime upgrade, codenamed Petra would mostly include runtime changes necessary to enable Sygma Ethereum bridge. My guesstimation is June/July this year.
1. We started runtime development for Luxor upgrade.
2. All validator module work was finished. We are currently working on QA and small fixed based on results. We should be able to release to production next term.
3. We have started work on WalletConnect implementation - both library and Pioneer changes.
4. We have developed a couple of updates to Discord role bot:

> 
> 
> 1. We have a new `DAO` role that captures all DAO members (workers + leads + council).
> 2. All `Worker` roles now also include leads, so you can tag all WG members with single mention
> 3. Fixed some edge cases that caused issues for certain members
1. We have developed a service that lets external tools easily fetch objects from our CDN - [https://assets.joyutils.org/video/123566/thumbnail](https://assets.joyutils.org/video/123566/thumbnail)
2. We have added video fees estimation to [https://joyutils.org/](https://joyutils.org/)
