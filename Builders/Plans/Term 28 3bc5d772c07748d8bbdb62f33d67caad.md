Comments:

1. As mentioned in the plan, the actual lead salary was higher because of the merging of AWG and BWG - [https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/761](https://pioneer.joyutils.org/#/proposals/preview/761)
2. No QA work was paid for this term. Ivan has been working on CRT and Validators dashboard QA that will be paid for once the work is finished.
3. $175 bounty was paid to worker `TheGrimSavage` for small improvements to Pioneer - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6003726-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6003726-1)
$100 bounty was paid to a designer `Ayaz05` for designs for WalletConnect and improved mobile flows for Pioneer - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6003785-2](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6003785-2)
4. [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6129629-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/6129629-1)

`*` - because of the lead salary being higher than initially budgeted, the group has ran out of budget before the term end and some debt was accrued by the workers. In the table above I have included total sums of paid + owed salaries. For reference here are the actual paid values for the term:

- Lead - 75,553.5 JOY / $2,719.95
- Devs - 180,872.66 JOY / $6,511.42
- Deputy - 18,223.68 JOY / $656.05
- Total - 283,677.62 JOY / $10,212.39

### 3. Group tasks

> Continue SWG/DWG support with tooling/infra work as needed.
> 

Done:

- We’ve had a call this term with JSG team to discuss and prioritize future developments for Argus&Colossus.
- We’ve deployed a testnet with squid-based versions of Argus&Colossus for testing.

> Release validator module if not major issues are found.
> 
- QA uncovered some issues that being worked through right now. I’m very confident we will release it in term 29.

> Create Nara runtime upgrade proposal if not major issues are found.
> 

Done.

> Continue work on WalletConnect.
> 

Work is ongoing - designs were finalized this term and we have MVP versions of both Atlas and Pioneer with WalletConnect support:

- [https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/pull/5867](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/pull/5867)
- [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4759](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4759)

We have spent some time on creating a reusable library with WalletConnect support that could be used by both Atlas and Pioneer but decided it would be a significant effort to migrate both apps to it so at the end we decided to get for separate app implementations.

> Continue runtime work for Luxor upgrade.
> 

Work is ongoing - we have finished development (needs review and merging) of both council treasury burn and vested payments from WG budgets. We’re currently working on Substrate version upgrade.

### 4. Other

1. We have done a lot of Nara work this term:
    1. We have finalised Ephesus→Nara testnet upgrade mimicking the mainnet upgrade and found no unexpected issues. We have tested multiple versions of different software (QN, storage nodes, etc.) and how they behave during the upgrade.
    2. We have found a problematic runtime parameter related to creator token automated market maker (AMM) functionality. After discussion with JSG team we have decided to change the value and included it in the runtime upgrade.
    3. We have created another testnet that upgraded Ephesus→Nara using exact same runtime blob as proposed for mainnet. We have also done tests of the AMM functionality.
    4. We have started upgrade preparations - writing changelogs, creating GitHub releases, etc.
    5. We have tested different wallets to make sure they work fine after the upgrade.
2. We have developed and deployed a couple of minor Pioneer fixes and improvements:
    1. Fix for OneKey - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4765](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4765)
    2. Improvements for email notifs - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4746](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4746)
    3. Improvements to role rewards display - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4745](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4745)
    4. Fixes for Nara - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4763](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4763)
    5. Ability to cancel proposals - [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4750](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/4750)
