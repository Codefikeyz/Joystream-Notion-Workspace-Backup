### 3. Group tasks

> Wrap up work on Luxor runtime upgrade, QA it, prepare a runtime upgrade proposal.
> 

Done. Dev and QA was finished, runtime upgrade proposal was submitted.

> Continue development of Sygma bridge, scope out the full epic. Scope out the Petra runtime upgrade.
> 

Done. Our plans have changed and we’re not pursuing Sygma bridge but we have been working on the Argo bridge, had 2 calls with DAO and JSG to discuss and prototyping has started. Petra runtime upgrade is not scoped yet, it will probably include a pallet for the Argo bridge.

> Provide support for Atlas issues.
> 

Done. We’ve done a couple of small fixes for CRT launch support.

> Deliver S3 backup support in Colossus.
> 

Not done. Work has been started but Luxor development took a bit longer than expected so we have made very little progress on that front.

> Investigate/create tooling for monitoring block times and validators’ performance.
> 

Done. We have done a bit of research into how exactly the consensus protocol works and why some blocks may be skipped. The situation seems stable now, the average block times are not increasing. We have added a widget to [joyutils.org](http://joyutils.org) that allows to easily check average block time in recent blocks so we can keep an eye on it.

### 4. Other

1. We’ve continued work to introduce query timeouts to QN.
2. We’ve continued work on a library for building Joystream apps.
