### 3. Group tasks

> Bring Argo bridge to usable state and deploy to Base. Work with the council on creating procedures and wider deployment plan.
> 

🟢 We have not deployed to Base, but we have a deployment on Base Sepolia testnet. We are working with JSG to finalize designs for the bridge app. The app also now supports all multisig operations. Council has passed a proposal for Argo parameters based on calls we’ve had.

> Review and ship pending Argus&Colossus features.
> 

🟡 We’ve made some progress on nodes maintenance feature but have not shipped it or the S3 support. For S3 we’re blocked by review from JSG, they have claimed multiple times they will do it but that has not materialized. I’m hoping it happens next term, if not, we will take care of it after bridge work is finished.

> Ship Metamask support in Pioneer and Atlas.
> 

🟡 We have shipped support in Pioneer, Atlas PR is still waiting for a review.

> Ship improvements to council report tool (CRT stats).
> 

🟡 We’re very close to releasing, we have worked with the council to find useful stats and make sure we include data that is needed. We need some last fixes and it will be out.
