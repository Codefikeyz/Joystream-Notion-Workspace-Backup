Notes:

1. `gyroflaw` was fired this term as all their legacy tasks were finished and paid.
2. `TheGrimSavage` finished their legacy tasks but were kept in group as they offered to work on some smaller issues for free and may receive small Pioneer bounties in the future.

### 2. Group budget

**JOY/USDT EMA30: 0.045** USDT

| **Item** | **USDT (planned)** | **USDT (actual)** | **JOY (planned)** | **JOY (actual)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lead salary | $2,770.21 | $2,781.74 | 61,560.29 JOY | 61,816.5 JOY |

| Total Spending | $11,220.21 | $8,694.18 | 249,338.07 JOY | 193,204.11 JOY |

Comments:

1. The actual spending was lower for 2 reasons:
    1. `thesan` salary was changed to full-time few days after the term has started,
    2. `attemka` is on vacation since Jan 9th, so his salary was updated to 0 for that time.
2. There was no QA work done by `ivant` this term. Some part of `freakstatic` salary was still covered by $1k payment last term, so only $400 was paid to him for his work on Nara QA and as Deputy - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5744956-5](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5744956-5).
3. $100 was paid to former worker `GoldWolf` for some work on curator tool - [https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5615943-1](https://joystream.subscan.io/extrinsic/5615943-1).

Done. WalletConnect epic was scoped into specific issues including design brief - [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5010](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/5010). We still need to find a designer to prepare the designs.
