# Term 2 (2023.1.2~2023.1.16)

- Replace hourly based salary with point based salary and gather feedback for further refinement.

Many builders are reluctant to report the correct number of hours they devoted to hard work, either out of modesty or whatever other reason there may be.
Besides, hourly payment is not a fair approach for workers who are fast and efficient.
Therefore we will implement point based salary as described here.
