([https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1067527222803574916](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1067527222803574916))

**Important Note: The number of workers in BWG is irrelevant to the WG budget. The budget is related to the achievement of the WG as a whole.**

    - Pioneer backend
    - financial page
    - bounty module
    
- **Gather feedback from community about Joystream tools and fix them**

    - Telegram Bot
    - Validator Page
    - Financial Page
    - Curator Tools ([https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/95](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/95))

## 5. Payment of Transition Period Debt

Following proposal [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/99](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/proposals/preview/99), BWG has received 1.6 MJOY.

Discretionary spending was applied to move this fund from WG budget to account `j4TKJMpok4bGz4grxWB2W5V5iQv7S3vNuzU1ZqmA62NqimbJW`.

The fund was distributed via a 700 day vested transfer following this procedure, [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/101](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/101).

The vesting starts from blocknumber 755,000 (2023/1/31) and ends in blocknumber 10,835,000 (2024/12/31)

**Note**

- 300,000 JOY was already paid out to workers from l1.media’s personal budget in december. So this amount was sent directly to l1.media’s account without vesting.
- TheGirmSavage and RogueTemplar’s debt was paid in January by Chaos77 to increase their funds to 16,667 JOY and enable them to apply for the BWG role.
