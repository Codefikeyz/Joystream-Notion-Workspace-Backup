# Mainnet Questions for Lead (Builder)

# **Questions**

1. **Write step by step guide on how the work within your WG will be organized in the first term of the mainnet**
- Council will make a proposal for hiring a Lead
- The lead will be hired;
- The lead will hire a deputy;
- The lead/deputies will hire workers.
- The team will work on jobs offered by council and other WGs and ensure Pioneer, Atlas and all relevant tools are working properly.

1. **Review [Gitbook Scores](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score) for your Work Group and tell:**
- *Which scores should be excluded?*
    
    General Score is obsolete since worker_opportunity_score, opening_score and bounty_score was intended for new worker onboarding and summary and plans are most comprehensible to the work group that has submitted it, not the council.
    
    In the Builder_score, the testing_score, pioneer_development_score and general_development_score could be combined into one development_score.
    
- *Which scores should be added?*
    
    I don’t have anything to add. 
    
- *If you have scores that purely depend on the JSG decision, how can these scores be adjusted so the Council will be able to assess them in a more objective way?*
    
    No such scores were observed. 
    
1. **For each position of your WG in the mainnet, incl. the Lead:**
- *Develop the Job Descriptions and provide links to them.*
    
    [Builder Responsibilities](Builders%20Responsibilities%20addf937d2f8c452ea93c46091c10d733.md)
    
- Propose a stake amount in USD (and JOY) required by the application for each position.
    
    The stake amount is based on the personal experience of getting to these milestones and responsibilities. 
    
    Lead - 1000 USD
    
    Deputy - 500 USD
    
    Worker - 100 USD
    
1. **If there will be fewer seats in the WG compared to the number of seats in the current testnet, which people will you hire? Propose your criteria.**
    
    The current people are all needed. Will try to hire them all, even at the expense of lower salary for each.
    
2. **How would you manage people who didn’t find their place in your WG, but who are still quite experienced?**
    
    They can provide consultation and help to other worker group members for a small fee. 
    
3. **Propose a forecast of *capacity* utilization for your WG over time (in terms of capacity required over time/ staff number required over time/ overall budget required over time). For example, for the Storage WG *capacity* will be the total storage space avaliable across all servers.**
    
    Staff number will stay around 10 for the time being
