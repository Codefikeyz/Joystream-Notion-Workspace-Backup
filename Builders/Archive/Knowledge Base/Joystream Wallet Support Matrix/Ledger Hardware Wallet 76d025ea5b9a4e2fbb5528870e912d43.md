# Ledger Hardware Wallet

Platforms: Hardware
Balance Support: No
Can we get added?: Yes, but it requires coding of a custom extension.

Joystream Support: No
Notes: A ledger wallet can currently receive Joystream assets but will not be able to do anything with them. A custom extension has to be created for support.
Testing Status: Done
