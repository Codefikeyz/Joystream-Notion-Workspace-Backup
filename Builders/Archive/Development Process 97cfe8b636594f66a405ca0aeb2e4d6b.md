# Development Process

JS Genesis team populates the backlog with issues where community development has the highest impact 🛠️ 💪🥇.

1️⃣  WG Lead or Worker with triage access assigns issues for development. Sometimes it’s not possible to assign a task to person. The workaround is to ask the person to leave any comment. After the comment is there, it’s possible for Lead to assign such a ticket.
2️⃣  Move the issue to `Dev in Progress` column once an assignee started working on it.
3️⃣  When ready, open a PR to the [Dev branch](unless stated otherwise in the issue) AND CONNECT to the issue by putting **"fixes #issue-id"** to the PR description.
⚠️ Make sure the code compiles **and the automated tests (CI) are passing** ☝️
4️⃣  Move the issue with the embedded PR to `In Review` column
5️⃣  Notify the lead via mention @singulart and on Discord 👾

🗺️  The above process of collaboration is nicely mapped out in this Miro Board:
