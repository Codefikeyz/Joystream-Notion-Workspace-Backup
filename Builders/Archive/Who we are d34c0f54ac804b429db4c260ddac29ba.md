# Who we are

Despite that we come from different cultures, mentalities and geographies, one thing that glues us all together is the passion for the technology in the broader sense, and for the blockchain in particular.

Our motto is tripartite:

> Keep Joystream DAO strong
Keep Joystream creators strong
Keep Joystream ecosystem strong
> 

To put it super-simple: Joystream Builders support the community in all technology-related hurdles.

`We will hold the Builders to a ... higher standard than we would for other community members or just your random contributor.` - JSGenesis
