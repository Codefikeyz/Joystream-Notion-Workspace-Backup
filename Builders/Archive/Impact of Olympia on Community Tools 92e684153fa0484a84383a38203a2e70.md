# Impact of Olympia on Community Tools

Olympia release brought in numerous breaking API changes that largely caught the Squad by surprise. As a group, we tend to be conscious and ironically aware of our own home-grown tooling.

Depending on JSG expectations, the list of community tools that are not functioning at the moment due to Olympia changes and require efforts to be fixed is, in order of priority:

1. [Council Report Script](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/755) - relevance of this script is questionable. 
2. Tokenomics Report Script - relevance of this script is questionable. 
3. [Working Group Bot](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/754) - DONE ✅
4. [Atlas Video bot](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/756) DONE ✅
5. [Forum Bot](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/757) - DONE ✅
