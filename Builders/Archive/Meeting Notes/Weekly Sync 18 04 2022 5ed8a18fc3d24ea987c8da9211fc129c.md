### Agenda

1. People need access to Github project: arsi44 and traumschule
2. Time reporting issues
3. Have opening for QA, no one applied except l1dev who is already a worker
4. Need clarity in Scoring Calculations
5. Where to see Builders Scores for previous Periods?
6. Any updates from JSG on [Step 0](../Jsgenesis%20Relations%207a2cbd55bb08430cae90a09faaa810d1.md)
7. AOB

### Minutes

1. Point taken
2. No action needed from JSG
3. JSG has no Full-time QAs, this responsibility is shared among stakeholders like Martin and some others. However, the idea to have several Builders focused on QA is good. Action point: let HR know that testing-savvy users active in relevant channels should be directed to apply for builders-QA. 
4. Point taken
5. Soon they will be made public
6. JSG is strongly hesitant about signing any kinds of contracts formalizing the working relations between the legal entity and Builders. 
7. @isonar highlighted the thought that JSG must compete for talent, as the number of opportunities in DAOs that do have the native coin to rewards workers is steadily growing. 
8. @isonar proposed to start targeting students, career-changers, internship-seekers instead of fully employed engineers, as these groups are more likely to be interested in current WG setup and compensation model.
