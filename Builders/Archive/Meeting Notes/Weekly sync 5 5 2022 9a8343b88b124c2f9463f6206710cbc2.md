Participants: isonar, Martin

Agenda:

1. Grading of Term 5 too low, doesn't reflect team effort
2. Suggestions for report improvement
3. Compensation for Repairing the community tooling. Can Lead hire themselves as workers when doing backlog tasks?
4. Issues with Staging env impact testing activities

Minutes:

1. Martin expects hours report to evaluate efforts and use that in grading. New fairer formulas introduced, “floor” removed for now. Note: separate formulas for Project 55 and Project 56. "Ceiling" in the formula is hard to be avoided. 
2. General criteria: report must give an impression of how workers perform. 
3. Yes, in Incentives 3.0. leads can hire themselves. But need to communicate to CMs what they do as leads and what they did as a worker.
