# Proxy Product Owner Responsibilities

The number of tickets in [Project 55](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55) backlog is growing rapidly. Therefore, there’s a need for an internal review and prioritisation. The new role of Proxy Product Owner is a Builder who stands between the Squad Lead and JSG Product Owner and carries the following duties:

1. Checks the backlog daily to detect newly added tasks by JSG. [Community Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55#column-18355320), [Bounties Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55#column-18402645) and [Ready to Test](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55#column-18357460) are the three backlogs to monitor. 
2. Reviews tasks descriptions to make sure they’ve got enough information to be taken by developers / QA. 
3. Tasks that miss details, or are unclear, need to be labeled `jsg-to-refine` and assigned to @Dima. After that, @Dima is pinged every now and then to update those tickets.
4. Moves items labeled with `high-prio` to the top of respective columns. 
5. Pays attention to large tasks (> 5 Story Points), suggests @Dima to break them down in smaller pieces.
