## **List of completed tasks**

This is usually reported separately! 

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- I can’t stress the importance of strong communication link with JSG.  This is so far the most problematic area.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- As a kind of follow-up to my previous Term’s observations about overblown hours reports: [https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/344](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/344)
- **To all WGs: keep a close watch on JSG grading (especially in the individual scores!) - there are sometimes unintentional errors in there.**
- ~~Let users withdraw the tJOY hassle-free! The cashout mint stays empty 99% of the time.~~
