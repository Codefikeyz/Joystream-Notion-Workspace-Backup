# Term 22 Report

Carthage Wave 2 testing - on track. Wave 3 Scope is to be merged in 1-2 weeks. 

## Pioneer Development Score

**Still in progress:**

- #3153 - slowly progressing. Worker needs to implement the pagination.
- [PR](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/3575) that was sent to review for #2334 but unexpectedly closed by the worker with no action taken to address review comments. I will try to assign it to someone else.
- Newcomer **mkblockchaindev** received a first task: #2715 (3SP). From what I see in the comment, they did a very good research of Rust codebase to uncover the logic behind the votes calculation.
- Worker **Gru** assigned a task  #3125 (3SP) - no progress updates so far.
