## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Please consider `GENERAL_DEVELOPMENT_SCORE=1` for this Term. PR for proposal bot will be delivered in Term 27 (if Carthage release happens, otherwise in Term 28)
- Please consider `PIONEER_DEVELOPMENT_SCORE=1` for this Term. There were some JSG-related requests that slowed the review down in one or two PRs

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Council! Please Grade the [Term 25](5%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%F0%9F%91%B7%F0%9F%8F%BD%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8FBuilders%20Term%2025%20(Sep%2023%20-%20Oct%201%202022)%20edb7dc67b1484d8fa3db3bd961fa296c.md). Late report is still a report. Late report submission must not be the reason not to do the scoring.
