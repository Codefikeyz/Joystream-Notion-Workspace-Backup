# Term 15 Report

## General Comments

1. Reduction of QA scope was [announced last week](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/991640002440208385). JSG was contacted to adjust the scoring formula, with no success (no response.)
2. Newcomers are coming, which is a good thing. But they require time to on-board.
3. If JSG is going to delegate the grading (presumably to @tomato), the policy regarding Project 56 should be revisited (community members are allowed to add tasks to this board)

## Pioneer Development Score

**Completed Tasks:** 

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3201 (**2SP**) Contrary to what was expected, this task had great progress, and the merged PR is supposed to also cover two more tickets:

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2976 (**2SP**) and ✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3025 (**2SP**)

Due to this perspective, I am reporting all three items as `completed`..

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3203 (**3SP**) This was completed by one of the newcomers, not before some back-and-forths. 

✅ [3082](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3082) (**3SP**), Merged after 12 days since creation of the PR. 

✅ [2705](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2705), **1SP**, Merged after 3 days in review by JSG

**Total Story Points completed:** **`13`** 

**Still in progress:**

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2832, **3SP**, unassigned, put to backlog

Made a call to assign https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2793 as Bounty for a newcomer next Term.

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2833, **3SP**, has some finishing touches outstanding, will be merged next Term with high likelihood. Currently “in Review”. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3153 **(3SP)** In progress for 6 days. Has a code dependency on https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3151 (meaning, common carousel component needs to be created that is going to be re-used)

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3151 **(5SP)** In progress for 3 days. This one and the one above required some extensive discussions on Discord. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2795 **(1SP)** Completed as part of Bounty [https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/98](https://dao.joystream.org/#/bounty/preview/98) and is with JSG for review (since July 12th) 

### General Development Score

1. ✅ https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/781 (**15SP**) Worker reported 13 hours spent on this item. Item went on review July 12th, but JSG did not come back yet. 
2. 😁 Worker **0xlegend** assigned to https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/744 has asked in DM to be Frontender, and be assigned a front-end task. This was after 6 days of “working” on this issue. Unfortunately,  #744 went back to backlog.  
3. https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/797 (**15SP**) had some initial research done, totaling **5h.**
