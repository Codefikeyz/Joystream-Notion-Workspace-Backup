# Term 14 Report

## General Comments

1. Reduction of QA scope was announced in the middle [of the Sprint](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/991640002440208385). Tried to reach out to JSG to adjust the scoring formula, with no success (no response.)
2. Pioneer Development is still the most problematic component. There was very little activity on Pioneer end this Term. 
3. If JSG is going to delegate the grading, as was mentioned in T13-T14 handover last week, the policy regarding Project 56 should be revisited (community members are allowed to add tasks to this board)

## Pioneer Development Score

**Completed Tasks:** 

The following tasks started in Term 12 (or earlier, see previous report) but the merge happened in Term 13:

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2657, **3SP**, react dev, no time report given. Estimated time spent: **2-4h. A lot of overhead in internal code reviews, potentially caused by language barrier (worker’s native tongue is Japanese.** 

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2770, **1SP**, assignee `kazuyanomura` 

**Total Story Points completed:** `4` 

**Still in progress:**

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2832, **3SP**, [**@oleksanderkorn](https://github.com/oleksanderkorn)** Another re-assigned long-standing ticket. Still no activity by assignee.  

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3201 No activity. Unlikely to be merged next Term!

## General Development Score

1. No closed items this Term doesn’t mean no activity. @lkskrn reported quite a few hours spent on https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/781 so hopefully this can be completed next Sprint. 
2. Duplicating [my attempt to appeal](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/992880031628001370) the grading of Term 12. 

## Testing Score

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3300

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3109

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2657 this was completed and merged this Term. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2787

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3056 This may or may not count, as apparently QA was under [false] impression that the bug was fixed. 

**Total Tickets verified:** `5` 

Hourly report for one of the QA. If JSG finds this insightful, Lead is happy to make this a mandatory rule to send these reports!
