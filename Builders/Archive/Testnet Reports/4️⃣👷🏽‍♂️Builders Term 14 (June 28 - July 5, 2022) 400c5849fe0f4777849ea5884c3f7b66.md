## **List of completed tasks**

This is usually reported separately! 

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- The feedback loop btw. BWG and JSG needs improvements. For instance, while the T12 scores are not yet finalized, chances are that Geneal Development Score will be zero despite reported 8 SPs is alarming. The motivation behind is clear, but such JSG moves must be discussed in advance to leave the WG some maneuvering possibility. Otherwise it’s really hard to improve the overall score.
- See [Previous Summary](3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%F0%9F%91%B7%F0%9F%8F%BD%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8FBuilders%20Term%2013%20(June%2019%20-%20June%2028,%202022)%208c8361721d0c4a609844554ecd9daef4.md).

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- As a kind of follow-up to my previous Term’s observations about overblown hours reports: [https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/344](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/344)
- **To all WGs: keep a close watch on JSG grading (especially in the individual scores!) - there are sometimes unintentional errors in there.**
- ~~Let users withdraw the tJOY hassle-free! The cashout mint stays empty 99% of the time.~~
