# Working Group Summary

## Term Highlights

1. ☹️ No meetings with JSG (last sync was on June 23rd, see [meeting notes](../Meeting%20Notes%20ed31d43577f84f3f85bf362c1476f063.md))

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- I can’t stress the importance of strong communication link with JSG.  This is so far the most problematic area.
- Carthage testing scope appears to be a complex piece. It would have been beneficial if JSG explained how new vesting functionality works, because Builder QA struggle with testing, have tons of questions etc

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- The on-going communication with Eco project to “borrow” their Points system to additionally incentivise active Builders
- Watch for overblown time reports in other WGs
