# 2️⃣👷🏽‍♂️Builders Term 12 ( June 12 - June 19, 2022)

Blocks: 1152000 - 1252800

# Working Group Summary

## Term Highlights

1. During the last Term, [a new policy](https://dao.joystream.org/#/proposals/preview/302) was introduced preventing Leads from self-hiring. As the Lead, I immediately took action and removed self-hiring. However, when I attempted to arrange a budget for new Tooling (Governance Bot) via the [`Signal proposal`](https://dao.joystream.org/#/proposals/preview/274), the Council was really hesitant.
2. New compensation model for Freelance Builders had a successful [temperature check](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/270).
3. There was no JSG involvement into the Joystream DAO this week, whatsoever. No new parameters published, no final Term 11 scores were published. Therefore, Council should expect, and not be surpsirsed, to the possible Builders WG Score decline for Term 12!

Additionally, there were couple of candidates interviewed in DM that have to be followed up next week.

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- My idea to improve Builders WG was discussed on Forum (see [https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/270](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum/thread/270)) and seemed to find some nice level of support. However, in the light of the last AMA, cashouts may be disabled in Carthage, and this effectively kills the idea on the spot 😢 😢 😢 😢
- The setup where workers have so much tJOY that they can buy Council seats whenever they desire, seems awkward. It's like in quantum physics where I can be my own's grand-dad under certain circumstances called quantum state :) As the Lead, I cannot forbid this or influence this, but in my opinion this creates an additional risk of micromanagement. WG worker knowing the internals of the WG work, will be tempted, as a CM, to use this knowledge in order to influence WG policies in a way that no regular CM would ever do :)

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Maybe the Council needs to do periodic snapshots of what are the WG workers JOY rewards?? Someone from the Council may be assigned to review the CRM Retool and prepare the report on this. This data will be super helpful to understand the fairness of Lead's rewards, for instance.
- Council needs to draw a line where its involvement in WG inner workings ends (and beyond which the micromanagement starts!) In my opinion, current DAO setup already introduced the layer of abstraction, because WGs Leads create **two distinct documents**: Reports and Summaries. **If Council only read Summaries carefully, while leafing through Reports briefly, that would be perfect!** Summaries contain **all** data points to measure WGs efficacy from the perspective of budgets spendings and WG Scores. On the contrary, Reports are most often too technical for CMs to even understand!
