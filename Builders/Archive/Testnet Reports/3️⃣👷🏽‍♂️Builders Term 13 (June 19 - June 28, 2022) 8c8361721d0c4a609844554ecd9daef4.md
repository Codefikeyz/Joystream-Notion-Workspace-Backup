## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Very bad quality of the latest Pioneer update may require review of the QA practices and the full-scale regression testing.
- See [Previous Summary](2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%F0%9F%91%B7%F0%9F%8F%BD%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8FBuilders%20Term%2012%20(%20June%2012%20-%20June%2019,%202022%2017dbf65a75124a5fa76094daa5e7edc5.md).

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Time reports from other WGs are strangely huge. CMs need to inquire what are those hours spent for.
- To all WGs: keep a close watch on JSG grading (especially in the individual scores!) - there are sometimes unintentional errors in there.
- Let users withdraw the tJOY hassle-free! The cashout mint stays empty 99% of the time.
