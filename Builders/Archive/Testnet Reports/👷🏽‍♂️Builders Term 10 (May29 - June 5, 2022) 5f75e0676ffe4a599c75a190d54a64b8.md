## Lead time report (if it looks like Joystream became Builders Lead’s full time job, that’s probably how it is atm)

## Recommendations for what should be focused on in the next council period in order to make the group more effective

1. Testing of `release-stabilization-7`
2. Figure out the better dev approach for tasks that require special network setup: lead roles, CM roles, specific bounty configuration etc. Not everything can be (and should be!) tested right in production blockchain. On the other hand, staging network is sometimes hard to setup for new devs.
3. There was a request from @tomato about the Forum bot https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/757 Council is advised to decide on the priority of this. 

## Suggested changes

Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built into this working group, other working groups, the council, or JSGenesis' role, in order to increase the overall effectiveness of the group or the project: 

- JSG: Bi-weekly meetings with Dmitry would be great
- Council: Have a genuine, not formal, interest in what Builders do 😄

### 🔧 Pioneer Development

As requested in Gitbook, trying to give more details on long-running tasks that are still not 100% done. Pardon the discombobulated formatting, will try to improve gradually. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2296 **3SP** initial estimate. Assigned 18 days ago, Dev activity started 11 days ago, PR created 5 days ago, a lot of reviewer activity and exchange in the comments. Reviewer [acknowledges](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/3126#issuecomment-1145864460) that the nature of purely FE tasks requires a lot of iterations. Despite this acknowledgement, I believe this ticket could have been done faster. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2712 **5SP** initial estimate. Initially assigned to worker on **May 5** who uncovered an issue with the underlying open source component. After, @isonar suggested to move this item out of Community backlog (see [Term report](%F0%9F%91%B7%F0%9F%8F%BD%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8FBuilders%20Term%207%20(May8%20-%20May%2015,%202022)%20d6631c29b839432bbd054b56d25abec1.md)). Whether this was communicated to JSG is unknown. 

Another developer found somewhat hacky way to support Markdown, and his PR was merged. QA, however, doesn’t seem to be happy with the outcome, as many of the Markdown tags still don’t work properly. 

 I still believe issues like this should not be left on community. Given that quite some hours were burned on this, I’ll include it in this report as “completed”. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2445 Assigned to dev 8 days ago, PR made 7 days ago, JSG left comments 3 days ago. Reviewer’s comments are still to be addressed. Reported **5h of work**

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2220 Assigned to dev 7 days ago, PR made 5 days ago, JSG left comments 3 days ago. Reviewer’s comments are still to be addressed. Reported **5h of work**

**Completed:** 

1. #2831, **3SP**, lkskrn (originally jameswee) https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2831 JSG review took ~2 days, 1h dev work, issue was probably given wrong SP estimate. 
2. https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3100, **2**SP, freakstatic. PR created 13 days ago. JSG reviewed and merged it 3 days ago. 

✅  Total: **5SP**, 14h
