# Term 13 Report

## General Comments

1. JSG was a bit slow in reviewing [the PR](https://github.com/singulart/joy-disco-bots/pull/4).
2. JSG provided Project 56 tasks very late, they will be triaged and processed next Term 14.
3. Workers were generously rewarded for reaching > 0.7 overall Score for Term 12
4. Pioneer Development is still the most problematic component. The most impact on the high score is `General Development` (done exclusively by the Lead and reported as extra activities) and `Testing`. 
5. The Squad probably need to hire a `facilitator` to try motivating workers to deliver more. 

## Pioneer Development Score

`DEVELOPMENT_SCORE:
If STORY_POINTS >= 12:  1
If STORY_POINTS < 12:   STORY_POINTS/12`

**Completed Tasks:** 

The following tasks started in Term 12 (or earlier, see previous report) but the merge happened in Term 13:

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2445 **2SP**, freakstatic, 2h. 

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2220 **1SP**, [**@oleksanderkorn](https://github.com/oleksanderkorn), 1**h. 

✅ https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2362 **5SP**, freakstatic, 5h.

**Total Story Points completed:** `8` 

**Still in progress:**

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2832, **3SP**, [**@oleksanderkorn](https://github.com/oleksanderkorn)** Another re-assigned long-standing ticket. No activity by assignee. I’ve done some research in Query node database, reported my findings here: [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/989081364630499358](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/989081364630499358) Unlikely to be merged next Term. Can be assigned to a backender! 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3201 A claim was made that this should have been fixed as part of another related bugfix. QA didn’t confirm this. Ticket is assigned back to worker. Needs a follow up or else will be reassigned to more active worker. Unlikely to be merged next Term!

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2657, **3SP**, assigned to `react dev` (newcomer) and was resolved pretty quickly after some internal review iterations. Currently in review by JSG (since yesterday.) Likely to be merged next Term.

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2770, 1SP, assignee `kazuyanomura` For a one-line fix, this really takes too long. Both internally (worker doesn’t know how to make PRs and work collaboratively) and from JSG end (stuck for 4 days in review!)

## General Development Score

No activity this Term. During the [weekly sync up](../../Meeting%20Notes/Sync%2023%2006%2043313b4f1d804896b4a5aa3939b8039a.md) we agreed with JSG to remove the GenDevScore component from the WG Score for this Term. (Still not done, looking at Gitbook!)
