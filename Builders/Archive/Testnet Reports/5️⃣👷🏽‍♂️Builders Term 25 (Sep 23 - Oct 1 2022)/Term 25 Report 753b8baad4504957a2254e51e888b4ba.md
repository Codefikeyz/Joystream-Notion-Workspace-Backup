### **General Development Score**

1. Work on Proposals Bot task from Project 56 started. https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/765
2. Additionally, the migration to [@joystream/types 0.20.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@joystream/types/v/0.20.2) has started. This appears to be a very complex and [time-consuming task](https://github.com/singulart/joy-disco-bots/compare/master...carthage-types_proposals-bot), I apologize for not mentioning it in a plan. **It is very important for the community, because without it done on time, the bot will stop working with the new testnet, and this is not acceptable of course. For instance, [the damage caused by Olympia breaking changes](../../Impact%20of%20Olympia%20on%20Community%20Tools%2092e684153fa0484a84383a38203a2e70.md) was also very huge, and the community wasn’t prepared for it.**
