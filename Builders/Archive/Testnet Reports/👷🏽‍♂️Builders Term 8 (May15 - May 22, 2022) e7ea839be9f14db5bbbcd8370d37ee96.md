# **Working Group Score key points**

## 💵 Accounting of how much was spent on what.

Budget at Term start: **35M** tJOY

Lead salary cut: Proposal `#184`

Budget cut: **28M** tJOY - Proposal `#172`

Budget received: **38M** tJOY - Proposal `#182`,`#197`

Wages paid: **7.3M** tJOY

Discretionary spendings: **none**

Budget at Term end: **37M** tJOY

Debt at Term end: **1.3M** tJOY - I believe this is incorrect as the number stays the same for the last couple of terms.

## Summary of how well the working group served its intended purpose

1. 👍🏿 Identity claiming flow complete. `#194`
2. 👎 No sync with Martin this week
3. 👎 Attempts to micromanage the group, assign tasks that  Lead had no incentives to refine and let the team do. 

## Recommendations for what should be focused on in the next council period in order to make the group more effective

1. ***Council is advised to reflect upon the sequence of proposals: 172, 184, 189, 197 🤔***
2. ***As the Lead, I expect my salary to reflect the efforts I spend for the DAO. For the last few Terms it’s 4-6h/day.*** 
3. Council is strongly advised to assign a different Builders liaison next Term. 
4. The group is expected to have more hires next week, so to accommodate them, **30% increase of weekly budget is a must, ideal increase by 60%.** 
5. Make lecture to CMs so they understand the Squad processes better 😃 

## Suggested changes
