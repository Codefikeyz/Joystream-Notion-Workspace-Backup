**Still in progress:**

- #3125 (3SP) has been un-assigned and placed back to To-Do due to worker inactivity.
- #3266 (3SP) has no signs of progress, worker promised to start working on this around Sep 25th
- #2832 (3SP) is worked on actively. This is a complex issue requiring some deep understanding of how Hydra Indexer works. Current assignee progresses slowly but surely. Expect PR next week.

### **General Development Score**

Advise to set the General Development score to zero unless there is an advance notice from Builders Lead that the work on Project 56 is planned
