### **General Development Score**

Two community requests were delivered this Term. One was [requested](https://github.com/singulart/joy-disco-bots/issues/15) by Storage Providers, the second one - by a user who had issues re-verifying with the [bot](https://github.com/singulart/joy-disco-bots/issues/14).
