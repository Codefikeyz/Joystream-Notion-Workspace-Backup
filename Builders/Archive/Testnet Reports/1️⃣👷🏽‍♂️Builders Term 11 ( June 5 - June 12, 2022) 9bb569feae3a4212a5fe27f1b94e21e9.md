## Summary of how well the working group served its intended purpose

1. 👍🏻 Forum bot released! https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/757
2. 👎 👎 👎 Dev resourcing issue continues. FM workers produce very sporadic and inconsistent output. Newcomers get disillusioned quite quickly, become unresponsive, and sometimes leave. The main reason being is the compensation model that is based on 100% virtual “CRM money” (also known as Bedeho-dollars). One possible solution I see is to pay workers *directly* at a standard rate **$30/h = 1.2M tJOY/h**. The exact amount will be calculated based on performance (number of burned Story Points.) Depending on the demand for this model, it may drain the WG budget really fast, as the current weekly refills are only **12M tJOY**. 
3. I am happy to give the above option a try, `if Council agrees to increase Squad weekly refills by **x2**`. With the current burn rate, this increase will allow to compensate **10h** of gig work, which may boost the `PIONEER_DEVELOPMENT_SCORE` a lot. 
4. Another possible option is direct payments to workers by JSG, like in other DAOs. 
5. 👎 No traction on Deputy Lead opening.

## Recommendations for what should be focused on in the next council period in order to make the group more effective

1. Finalize the `Gig worker` model terms and conditions

 

## Suggested changes

Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built into this working group, other working groups, the council, or JSGenesis' role, in order to increase the overall effectiveness of the group or the project: 

- As the Lead, my decision to hire myself as a worker to compensate the numerous hours I spend coding (coding is NOT part of my responsibilities) was questioned this week. I am more than happy to change this if Council guarantees the compensation via `Funding proposals`
- Try paying workers directly. The Squad has quite a significant tJOY buffer (**28M tJOY**)to experiment and see how it affects the score.

# All information your **WG Scores** ask for **`(a.k.a Report)`**

### Testing Score Formula [no change]

`TESTING_SCORE:
If ISSUES_TESTED >= 15:     1
If 5 < ISSUES_TESTED < 15:  ISSUES_TESTED/15
If ISSUES_TESTED =< 5:      0`

### General Development Score Formula [updated]

`DEVELOPMENT_SCORE:
If STORY_POINTS >= 5:  1
If STORY_POINTS < 5:   STORY_POINTS/5`

### Pioneer Development Score Formula [updated]

`DEVELOPMENT_SCORE:
If STORY_POINTS >= 12:  1
If STORY_POINTS < 12:   STORY_POINTS/12`

### 🔧 Pioneer Development

As requested in Gitbook, trying to give more details on long-running tasks that are still not 100% done. Pardon the discombobulated formatting, will try to improve gradually. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2832 Accepted for development 17 days ago. Assigned 5 days ago initially to one worker, then to another one. Some [preliminary research was reported](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/984758366985420830), but still no PR **3SP** initial estimate. Assigned 18 days ago, Dev activity started 11 days ago, PR created 5 days ago, a lot of reviewer activity and exchange in the comments. Reviewer [acknowledges](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/3126#issuecomment-1145864460) that the nature of purely FE tasks requires a lot of iterations. Despite this acknowledgement, I believe this ticket could have been done faster. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2445 No progress on this since the last report. Worker was followed up multiple times on Discord, was unresponsive.

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2220 same situation as above

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2362 Assigned to worker in mid-April. No traction on the ticket until very recently. PR created, sent to JSG for review. 

**Completed:** 

1. https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2296 **3SP**. Finally the PR was merged 5 days ago. 😃 Success!!! Takeaway lesson: some pioneer tickets estimated as 2-3 SP require a lot of back-and-forth communication and are being delayed significantly. 
2. https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2431 **1SP**. This was done during this Term, reviewed and merged really quick.
