## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Still relevant!!! → Meetings with JSG regarding the scope of work for Builders are now in the past. We need to figure out the new way of working instead of [current one](../Jsgenesis%20Relations%207a2cbd55bb08430cae90a09faaa810d1.md).
- Still relevant!!! → Carthage testing scope appears to be a complex piece. It would have been beneficial if JSG explained how new vesting functionality works, because Builder QA struggle with testing, have tons of questions etc

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Eco people wait for the draft proposal on how to use their points system.
- Still relevant!!! → Watch for overblown time reports in other WGs
- Review Leads’ salary at least quarterly.
