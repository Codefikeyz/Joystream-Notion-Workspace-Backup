## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- I can’t stress the importance of strong communication link with JSG.  This is so far the most problematic area.
- Majority of workers apparently wait for ReTool update, as the missing data in that system is a huge frustration driver.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Grading of T13 - T18 must be completed ASAP.
- Failure to release Carthage on time created a strange situation where Builders aren’t motivated to deliver.
