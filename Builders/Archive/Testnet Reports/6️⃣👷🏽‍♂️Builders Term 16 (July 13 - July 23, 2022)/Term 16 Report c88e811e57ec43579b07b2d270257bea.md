## Testing Score

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3238 - testing activity on this one has continued on July 15th, **1h spent total**

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3360 - 1h

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2793 - 30 min

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3203 Was initially tested on July 13th, but on July 20th was [reopened](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3203#event-7038031920) by JSG. This is confusing when done without any comments. Should this be re-rested? Why? 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3239 Talisman integration testing is a complex thing, may re-appear in the upcoming reports!
