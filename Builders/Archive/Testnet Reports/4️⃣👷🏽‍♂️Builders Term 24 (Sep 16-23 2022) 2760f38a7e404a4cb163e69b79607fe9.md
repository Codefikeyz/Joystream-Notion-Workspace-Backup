## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Protocol of interaction with JSG post-mainnet launch has to be defined.
- Organize Team Gathering and play some games together (Geoguesser)
- The Squad needs fresh blood! I haven’t seen new candidates incoming from HR / Marketing. I suggest CMs to follow up with their Leads on the state of hiring.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Still in progress: Eco people wait for the draft proposal on how to use their points system.
- No feedback from CMs: Review Leads’ salary at least quarterly.
- Something similar to [https://dao.joystream.org/#/proposals/preview/643](https://dao.joystream.org/#/proposals/preview/643) has to be defined but more focused on business development, gateways, revenue generation.
- Brainstorm how to calculate the traffic flowing via distributor nodes
