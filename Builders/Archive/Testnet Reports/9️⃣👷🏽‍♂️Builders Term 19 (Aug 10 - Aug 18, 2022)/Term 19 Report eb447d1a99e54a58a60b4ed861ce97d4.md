# Term 19 Report

<aside>
💡 **Important information for reviewers**

The focus of Builders work has changed. In previous Terms we were working with the backlog defined by JSG in [Project 55](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55) and [Project 56](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/56) in Github. Now, the main focus is to help JSG in community testing of Carthage network: https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3403 

Testing Carthage is a HUGE effort by both Dev and QA builders (other WGs give Builders a hand, too!) It “eats” almost all the time capacity. Unfortunately, it is not easy to report this work according to the old scoring formulas, so do not be surprised that in this (and maybe some future) report there are very small Story Points metrics. 

So, be prepared that **General Development** and **Pioneer Development** scores will be **almost 0** for this Term and maybe the next one.
