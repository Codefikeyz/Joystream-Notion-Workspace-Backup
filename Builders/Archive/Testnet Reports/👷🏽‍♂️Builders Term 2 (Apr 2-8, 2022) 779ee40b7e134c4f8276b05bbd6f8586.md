# 👷🏽‍♂️Builders Term 2 (Apr 2-8, 2022)

JSG-driven scope, as defined in [GitBook](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/builders-score). We anticipate the home page for teams’ assignments to change, as at the moment it’s a mix of Squad description and time-sensitive tasks 🙂

Anyhow, there were some expected deliverables for our Group this week. This is what we were able to achieve:

### General Management

Working on the [writeup](../Jsgenesis%20Relations%207a2cbd55bb08430cae90a09faaa810d1.md) formalizing the WoW (way of working). This has been presented to Martin on April 8, waiting for feedback. 

### ACCESS_RIGHTS

**Github Project Board**: Requested research complete. Workers need `write` access rights as per [the official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization).  

**Github Project Board:** [Pinged JSG](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/961165253486469130) to request access. Waiting for response. `Access Provided`

### WORKFLOW_FEEDBACK

- Test-Failed column seems redundant. If testing failed, leave a comment and move to `Dev in progress`.
- Why two Backlog columns? `Community Dev` and `Bounties`.
- Leave only one `Code Review` column to simplify the flow.
- No need for `Merged on Dev` column. Merged tickets to go to `To Test`.
- Rename `Tested-Ready for Prod` to `Done` :)

### ENVIRONMENT_SCORE

[Guides](../Knowledge%20Base/Local%20Dev-chain%2015f7821d63dd4a0899a3253371860107.md) are been worked on / consolidated from elsewhere.

[Staging Env](../Knowledge%20Base/Staging%20Environment%20d810f24ca31e4129884e964900350b87.md) details received.

### TESTING_SCORE

An opening for QA that would target tickets for testing is created. As previous testnet has demonstrated vividly, developers suck at testing...

In the meantime: reviewed some items in Ready for Test:

### Other Feedback

[https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/builders-score](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/builders-score)

TESTING_SCORE formula is unclear:

`TESTING_SCORE = PIONEER_TEST_SCORE*WORKFLOW_SCORE = [(15 - ISSUES_TESTED_SCORE_i*GRADING_i)/15]*WORKFLOW_SCORE`

DEVELOPMENT_SCORE is unclear: 

`ISSUE_POINTS = Sigma(STORY_POINTS_i)
DEVELOPMENT_SCORE = (10-ISSUE_POINTS)/5`
