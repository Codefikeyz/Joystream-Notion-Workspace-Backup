## Summary of how well the working group served its intended purpose

1. Big hiring success (2 new Developers, 1 new QA hired)
2. Working Group Bot repaired.

## Recommendations for what should be focused on in the next council period in order to make the group more effective

1. Address Markdown issue [https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2712](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2712)

## Suggested changes

Suggested changes to the purpose or practices built into this working group, other working groups, the council, or JSGenesis' role, in order to increase the overall effectiveness of the group or the project:

- According to the feedback from Thesan#5119, he expects pull requests to have `jsg-code-review` label and CI passing.
- Any development or testing task that Council wants to be addressed by the group, is expected to have an approved Signal Proposal first, and, secondly, an descriptive user story created in Project 56. Remember, Builders group score is driven by completed items from [Project 55](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55) or [Project 56](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/56). That means Builders Lead can only give workers tasks that has been pre-approved by JSG and assigned Story Point value.
- CI checks are unstable, core Team is aware of this but has no capacity to address those instabilities.
- Builders are promised to have a dedicated staging environment.
