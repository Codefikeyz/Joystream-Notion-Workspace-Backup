# Term 21 Report

The Carthage testing scope was unexpectedly increased. It appeared that what was tested already up to this point was only “Part 1”.  Part 2 [started](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/910968995379822633/1013893174198010027) this week.

#3347 - completed by bounty worker 

**Still in progress:**

- #3153 - PR created by gyroflaw. JSG provided review comments. This ticket is large (not sure if SP estimate should be updated to reflect the complexity,) so it is fair to expect some back-and-forth between Builders and JSG.
- [PR](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/pull/3575) is in review for #2334
