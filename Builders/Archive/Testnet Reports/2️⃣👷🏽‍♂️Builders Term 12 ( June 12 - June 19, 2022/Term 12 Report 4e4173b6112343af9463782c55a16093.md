# Term 12 Report

## Pioneer Development Score

😢 Only one task has been completed for Pioneer Development this Term. This is how the current in-flight tickets look.

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2445 This ticket was re-assigned to another Builder, because the initial assignee is still unresponsive and is remarked via `operationsWorkingGroupAlpha.workerRemark()` extrinsic. The review of the new PR went reasonably fast, some changes requested. Current assignee addressed requested changes, Lead re-requested JSG review. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2220 Same as above. Ticket had to be reassigned to another Builder. The PR review happened within 24 hours after the review request. Changes were requested, addressed, JSG review has been re-requested. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2362 Assignee made changes 2 days ago, but I am not sure if JSG reviewer got the notification or signal that the ticket is ready to be reviewed again. In addition, the CI for the PR seems to be stuck. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/2832 Another re-assigned long-standing ticket. After the [initial investigation](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/984758366985420830) during Term 11, there was no progress on this issue this Term. 

https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/issues/3201 Assigned, but no PR was created, assuming no developer activity.

## General Development Score

**Completed** ✅ https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/756 **8SP**, 10h. The task is under review, but the coding part was done. I suggest to consider this item as completed during grading. 

Two Bounties that were created for backend developers from the Project 56 backlog were reported as done this Term. First of all, I’d like to mention that the choice of tickets to create Bounties was not approved by Builders Lead (so these Bounties came as a sort of surprise!) My concern was that these tasks are rather lengthy, which makes them quite poor candidates for newcomers. 

Ticket https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/744 was reported as “completed” on June 13th via DM, but the [code](https://github.com/QuintinMakwe/Distributor-Node-Check) was revealed two days later, on June 15th. The initial review was done, the code was runnable, but the data it gathered wasn’t fully correct. This is why the task was sent back to developer for rework (June 16th) - no updates since then. 

Side note. Trying to be as precise as possible in evaluating these Bounties, because the rewards are quite generous, so in my opinion submissions must be of high quality. 

The second Bounty is still to be reviewed. https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/745
