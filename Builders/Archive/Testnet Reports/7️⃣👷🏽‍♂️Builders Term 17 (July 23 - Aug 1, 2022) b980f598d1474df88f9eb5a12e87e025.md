None

### Firings

1. **Pallike**. This was quite a surprise. The worker used to deliver actual value. Then suddenly during the daily status check they stated in DMs that they don’t intend to continue with the Joystream. 
2. **m00n620**, this was a planned fire, as worker went unresponsive for an extended period of time

## **List of completed tasks**

This is usually reported separately! 

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- I can’t stress the importance of strong communication link with JSG.  This is so far the most problematic area.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Grading of T12 - T17 must be completed ASAP.
- Retool must be updated ASAP, new workers leave disappointed! They don’t find themselves in Retool after 4-6 weeks of joining, and start to believe that this project is just another scam.
- Big Q: how can the Joystream community that came out of the FM programme really OWN the Joystream, if its collective share of the entire JOY allocation promised by JSG is **only 20%, that is, very small**? I don’t consider VCs and backers as part of its community, as well as JSG core team! IMO, the community must own **51% of JOY supply.**
