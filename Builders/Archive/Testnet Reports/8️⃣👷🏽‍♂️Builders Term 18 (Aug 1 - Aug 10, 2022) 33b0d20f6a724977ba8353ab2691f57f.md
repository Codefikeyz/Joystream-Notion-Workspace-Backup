### Hires

None. 

An Interview with the Deputy Lead candidate was done on Aug 1st, the results communicated to Marketing team. 

### Slashes

None

### Firings

1. kazuyanomura
2. react dev

Rationale: no palpable deliverable produced since the beginning of hire, workers are inexperienced and require a lot of effort to baby-sit.

- Carthage testing: **8h**

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- I can’t stress the importance of strong communication link with JSG.  This is so far the most problematic area.
- Majority of workers apparently wait for ReTool update, as the missing data in that system is a huge frustration driver.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- Grading of T12 - T17 must be completed ASAP.
- Big Q: [how can the Joystream community that came out of the FM programme really OWN the Joystream, if its collective share of the entire JOY allocation promised by JSG is **only 20%, that is, very small**? I don’t consider VCs and backers as part of its community, as well as JSG core team! IMO, the community must own **51% of JOY supply.](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/968135593378865182/1003571754595262514)**
