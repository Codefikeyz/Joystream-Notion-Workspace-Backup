# Term 20 Report

It was [promised](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344874099277824/1009901766835437652) that in the event of successful completion of Carthage scope before Term 21 every participant who actively helped to achieve this important goal would be rewarded generously with $JOY. However, due to #3411 is still not complete, the scope of Carthage testing cannot be considered complete. Therefore, the team isn’t eligible for $JOY reward. 

## Pioneer Development Score

**Completed Tasks:** 

No gradable activity. See the disclaimer above. [Task 804](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/804) was closed because the scope therein isn’t needed by Distributors team. 

**Still in progress:**

#3153 - PR created by gyroflaw. JSG provided review comments. This ticket is large (not sure if SP estimate should be updated to reflect the complexity,) so it is fair to expect some back-and-forth between Builders and JSG. 

**General Development Score:**

No gradable activity this Term. See the disclaimer above.
