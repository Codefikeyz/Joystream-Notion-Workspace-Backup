# Salary Calculation Guideline

Since developer work progress can be assessed most efficiently by means of points, we will employ point based salary calculation.

We will apply AP(achievement point)s to every job done by the following workers.

- Developer
- Reviewer
- QA Tester
- Designer

The AP will be assigned after the job is done, by measuring stats like time spent on work, complexity of task, importance of task and impact on project.

| Task | AP |
| --- | --- |
| new PR | 1~20 |
| review | 1~20 |
| PR merge | 1~20 |
| QA test | 1~20 |
| design | 1~20 |

(This table is just a draft. Suggestions are welcome!)

The actual reward of each worker will be calculated (1 AP = 2000 JOY) at the end of term and paid out during the next term.
