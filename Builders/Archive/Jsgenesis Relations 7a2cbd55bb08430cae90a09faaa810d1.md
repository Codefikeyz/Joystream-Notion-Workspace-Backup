### 0. Status of the Squad and Squad workers in JSG setup

Any company leverages either in-house workforce, or external contractors. In certain cases the freelance workforce is also used, and even unpaid internships. Every working model entails its own legal status and its own advantages/disadvantages. 

An open question to JSG in the light of the above is how the Builders Squad is viewed and what legal framework (if any at all) is expected to govern the working relations between the Builders Squad and JSG. 

Involving the Builders Squad into JSG flagship products ([Pioneer](https://dao.joystream.org) and [Atlas](http://play.joystream.org/)) development lifecycle may be seen as an [extended team](https://developmentaid.it/extended-teams-model-how-does-it-work/) model that is quite commonplace nowadays. However, from a perspective of a company willing to use ETM to meet its delivery targets, if must secure the competitive compensation and legal framework for extension workers, neither of which follows from JSG initial view. 

**One thing that seems to be the shared understanding on all levels: Builders is the special and unique Squad, not like any other squad within Joystream community.** 

Unique problems call for creative solutions.

**Outcome. JSG is not in the position to sign any contracts with Builders.** 

### 1. Weekly sync with JSG

In the past testnets JSG tried to interact with the larger community (and with Operations WG, the predecessor or Builders Squad, in particular) in a detached and de-personalized manner. Discord was (and still is) *the* tool for communication. Written reports were the prime input for grading activity. 

We believe this communication protocol is ~~broken~~ obsolete! Couple of reasons why:

1. Written reports don’t give the **human-centric** angle of what’s going on within the squad. They are meant to provide hard quantifiable and gradable facts: who did what and when. Video reports in a format of “Council Term Summary” from Sumer in Giza worked slightly better than written reports in the sense that they created a more personal dimension to the bureaucratic reporting activity. Reality is, however: we as a Squad don’t have capacity to produce decent video reports. 
2. Video conferencing (especially when cameras are on) is known to aid in building working relations intimacy.

As the Builders Squad is special and unique, having a direct link to JSG using weekly 1h session seems a natural move. 

**Outcome: Approved by JSG, weekly call is set every Fri, 4 p.m. GMT+2**

### 2. Product Owner role

This is the main stakeholder for all backlog-related matters, and it is expected that they are available in business hours in Discord. 

**Outcome: dmtrmltsv#1123 is assigned as a PO**

### 3. Proxy Product Owner Role

This is a community member hired by Builders specifically to identify unclear and poorly written items in Project 55, and to communicate those to Product Owner.

**Outcome: secret_girl is assigned as a Proxy PO**

### 4. Project [55](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55) vs Project [56](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/56)

These two Github Projects are the main source of work for Builders. It means no JSG person (or CM, for that matter) can task the Builders with some piece of work that’s not in one of these projects. Moreover, tasks for Project 56 need to be made known to JSG at least one Term in advance, so the hours burned for them come at no surprise in the Squad report. 

### 5. Backlog

~~To increase transparency and traceability, all tasks coming from JSG stakeholders must first land in [Community Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/Joystream/projects/55) backlog. By default, all new backlog items have `low` priority.~~ 

Builders Lead checks the backlog daily for new items.

~~Builders Lead~~ [Proxy PO](Proxy%20Product%20Owner%20Responsibilities%2023e563c16cfc41f39f960b2d63e875c7.md) works with JSG Product Owner to prioritize backlog items.

~~Builders Lead together with the Workers works out tasks estimates (in [Story Points](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation#:~:text=Story%20points%20are%20units%20of,work%2C%20and%20risk%20or%20uncertainty.), and potentially in $JOY)~~

Higher priority backlog items are moved to top, lower priority items are moved to the bottom. 

Workers are assigned tasks from the top of the backlog, and move them to `In progress` swimlane.

### 6. Grading and Evaluations Challenges

Three principal constituents of the Builders Squad Score are `TESTING_SCORE` , `GENERAL_DEVELOPMENT_SCORE` and `PIONEER_DEVELOPMENT_SCORE`. Builders Lead to make sure these parameters are as close to **`1`** as possible. 

The biggest **challenge** here is unpredicted availability of the workers.  Unlike traditional companies, in DAOs the manager can’t expect workers to be available at a given moment of time, which may jeopardise the deliverables and scoring. It is essential to have at least 1-2 weeks advance understanding of who will be available for picking up the tasks and for how many hours. 

🤔 How to get there? 

### 7. Project 56 Scoring

Given the low current developers activity it is highly unlikely that the Squad will deliver on both Pioneer and Community backlogs every Term. Suggesting the following process: if there is no planned activity for Project 56, Lead to give Martin an advance heads up, Martin  to remove General Development from the scoring formula for the next term.
