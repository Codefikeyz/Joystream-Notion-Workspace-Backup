Comment: technically we don’t need any more workers, as now we have excessive capacities

## **Onboarding plans for newcomers**

- I’m assist newcomers in the #storage-provider Discord group and in DM. The plan is to hire a newcomer every period and fire members who does not qualify the requirements.
- This term I am *keep* assisting the Deputy Lead with his automation of the Storage Report and Elastic Search dashboards development
- All newcomers should complete the new bounty [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Bounty-Storage-WG-Entry-Level-74b13f81a32d4efb811f8259d6fbeee0](Bounty%20%5BStorage%20WG%5D%20%5BEntry%20Level%5D%2074b13f81a32d4efb811f8259d6fbeee0.md)

## **Group Priorities for the Term**

- Keep educating the deputy about the lead tasks
- Keep improving LOGGING_SCORE (responsible @Yasir )
- Keep improving RESEARCH_SCORE (to be completed this term)
- Keep improving COST_SCORE (waiting for the feedback from the JSG)
- Keep improving STORAGE_SCORE
- Make sure every storage node provider has Query node set up and synced

## **List of Suggestions**

- We need more candidates for the SP role (Last time there was only 1 candidate for 1 opening which is extremely low number. And this candidate was FM member *@kalpacki*)
- We need feedback on Storage Scores for the past few terms!
