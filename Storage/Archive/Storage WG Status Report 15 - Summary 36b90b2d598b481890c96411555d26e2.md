## Group Changes

### Hires

- No one was hired

Here are reasons behind that: 

<aside>
💡 1. No candidates
2. Also pay attention, now we have the COST_SCORE which appeared from the fact that we hired more people that we really needed (i told about that to Council many times). So JSG is basically asking why many people maintain costly hardware taking into account that this extra capacity *is not really needed*.

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Make a decision how to balance between OPPORTUNITY SCORE and COST SCORE. See the discussion [here](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344681786507274/995763117030117456). If one is improved, the other one will be degraded.
- Feedback on the scores is extremely helpful. Next time please make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. So we will be able to work more efficiently during the term.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- To conduct Leads meeting to increase level of collaboration and understanding what’s going on in the project
