## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Feedback on the Scores as @freakstatic did the last time was extremely helpful  [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344681786507274/987280349740552235](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344681786507274/987280349740552235)
- Next time please make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. So we will be able to work more efficiently during the term.
