## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Feedback on the Scores as @freakstatic did the last time was extremely helpful  [https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344681786507274/987280349740552235](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/812344681786507274/987280349740552235)
- Next time plz make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. I.e. we received scores for the 11th term only on Friday. We couldn’t not show *best possible* the improvement of the scores in such circumstances.

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- To conduct Leads meeting to increase level of collaboration and understanding what’s going on in the project
