## **Onboarding plans for newcomers**

- I’m assist newcomers in the #storage-provider Discord group and in DM. The plan is to hire a newcomer every period and fire members who does not qualify the requirements.
- The Deputy Lead is absorbing knowledge at a good pace, so in near future he will be  ready to become the Lead and make a rotation.
- Last term I created a bounty that can reveal the most experienced and motivated newcomers.

## **Group Priorities for the Term**

- Improve the Research Score
    - Finish setting up the ES
    - Configure Storage Dashboards
- Update the reporting script
    - Configure new reports on the ES
- Boost the education of the Deputy Lead and introduce him with the Storage reports
- Hire two new Storage Workers
    - Choose the best newcomer for Storage Worker role
    - Accept @bwhm for the Storage Worker role

## **List of Suggestions**

- We can have periodic JSG meetings in order to get a better tech feedback
