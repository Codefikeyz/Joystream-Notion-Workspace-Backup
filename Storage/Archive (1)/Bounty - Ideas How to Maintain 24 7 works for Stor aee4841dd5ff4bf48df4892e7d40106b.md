# Bounty - Ideas How to Maintain 24/7 works for Storage Servers

    Bounty - Maintain 24/7 works for Storage Servers
    
- **High level summary and purpose**

We need to make sure failed storage nodes are excluded from the list of nodes quickly. If a node goes offline during the Lead’s night hours, the problem can be fixed only once the Lead is wake up. In order to unassign bags from the bucket (for failed node), the Lead need to trigger transaction with his role key.

- **Time estimate to complete, assuming some relevant skills, but little to no experience with Joystream or the working group**

5-10 hours (with good undertsanding of Storage System architecture)

- **Detailed scope of work, relevant for either a specific part of the working group score, or more general**

Detailed list of suggestion with high level plan for implementation.

- **Discord handle and `memberId` of a worker (or the Lead) WG to act as the oracle for the bounty**
