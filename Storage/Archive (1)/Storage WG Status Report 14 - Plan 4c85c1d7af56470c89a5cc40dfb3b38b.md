Comment: technically we don’t need any more workers, as now we have excessive capacities

## **Onboarding plans for newcomers**

- I’m assist newcomers in the #storage-provider Discord group and in DM. The plan is to hire a newcomer every period and fire members who does not qualify the requirements.
- This term I am assisting the Deputy Lead with his automation of the Storage Report and Elastic Search dashboards development
- All newcomers should complete the new bounty [https://www.notion.so/joystream/Bounty-Storage-WG-Entry-Level-74b13f81a32d4efb811f8259d6fbeee0](Bounty%20%5BStorage%20WG%5D%20%5BEntry%20Level%5D%20be098da029c541f199210891c08c99b9.md)
