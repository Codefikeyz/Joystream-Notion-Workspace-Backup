## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Remove worker opportunities score
- Feedback on the scores is extremely helpful. Next time please make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. So we will be able to work more efficiently during the term.

Not sure that i fully understand these Scores

- SYSTEM_SCORE:
    - All storage nodes display their location coordinates, node storage capacity and **caching** in the metadata (what is caching?)
    - All storage that has been in the working group for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and **share the public url** in the metadata (where should it be shared?)

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- To conduct Leads meeting to increase level of collaboration and understanding what’s going on in the project
