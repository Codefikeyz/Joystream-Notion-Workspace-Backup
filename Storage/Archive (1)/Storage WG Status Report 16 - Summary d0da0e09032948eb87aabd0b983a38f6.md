Soon we will have a runtime upgrade which means that all workers will be fired and some of them will be hired again. Cost issues will be much more important then.

- SYSTEM_SCORE: work is in progress. Specifically we made significant improvement on the following items:
    - All storage nodes display their location coordinates, node storage capacity and caching in the metadata
    - All storage that has been in the working group for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and share the public url in the metadata
- Keep assisting the Deputy Lead.
- Worked with the Marketing/ HR to find more candidates to the group

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Remove worker opportunities score.
- Feedback on the scores is extremely helpful. Next time please make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. So we will be able to work more efficiently during the term.

Not sure that i fully understand these Scores

- SYSTEM_SCORE:
    - All storage nodes display their location coordinates, node storage capacity and **caching** in the metadata (what is caching?)
    - All storage that has been in the working group for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and **share the public url** in the metadata (where should it be shared?)

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- To conduct Leads meeting to increase level of collaboration and understanding what’s going on in the project
