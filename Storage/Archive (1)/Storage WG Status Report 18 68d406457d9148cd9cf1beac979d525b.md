Soon we will have a runtime upgrade which means that all workers will be fired and some of them will be hired again. No need to hire a worker few days before the new testnet

    - One more node is migrating to a cheaper HDD server (worker name: sieemma)
- Improved STORAGE_SCORE in terms of:
    - All but one workers (worker name: MMX) have set up their extra field in the metadata json

## **Ideas to improve your Working Group**

- Remove worker opportunities score
- Feedback on the scores is extremely helpful. Next time please make the scores for the previous term to appear quicker. So we will be able to work more efficiently during the term.

Not sure that i fully understand these Scores

- SYSTEM_SCORE:
    - All storage nodes display their location coordinates, node storage capacity and **caching** in the metadata (what is caching?)
    - All storage that has been in the working group for more than 1 week (100,800 blocks), must maintain their own query node, and **share the public url** in the metadata (where should it be shared?)

## **Ideas to improve other Working Group, Council, Jsgenesis**

- To conduct Leads meeting to increase level of collaboration and understanding what’s going on in the project
