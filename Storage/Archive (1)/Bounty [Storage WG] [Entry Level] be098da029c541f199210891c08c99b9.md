# Bounty [Storage WG] [Entry Level]

- **Title**
    
    Bounty [Storage WG] [Entry Level] - Set Up a Joystream Node
    
- **High level summary and purpose**

       Participants should set up a Joystream Node and make it fully synced. This task is intended to cut our unsuitable candidates (1) who is fully not familiar with Linux/ Bash (2) who is not really motivated for the work in the Storage WG  willing to spend extra time for the Storage work 

- **Time estimate to complete, assuming some relevant skills, but little to no experience with Joystream or the working group**

An experience candidate can complete the task within 1-2 hours.

- **Detailed scope of work, relevant for either a specific part of the working group score, or more general**
